[Source data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

## Output

Analyse the data and answer the following questions:

- Understanding what content is available in different countries
- Identifying similar content by matching text-based features (basically given a title show me all other titles in the same category)
- Does Netflix has more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years.

- The network diagram takes ages to plot with the full dataset, so only a subset of the data is used [0:2000]
