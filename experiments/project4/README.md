# data-analysis-movies

## Input

A list of movie information from Netflix.

[Source data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

## Output

Analyze the data and answer the following questions:

- Understand what content is available in different countries.
- Identify similar content by matching text-based features (basically given a title, show me all other titles in the same category).
- Does Netflix have more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years?
- Perform network analysis of actors/directors and find interesting insights.

## Notes

- The network diagram takes ages to plot with the full dataset, so only a subset of the data is used [0:2000].
