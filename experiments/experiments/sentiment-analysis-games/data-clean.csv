review
"Games good, But Rockstar Your a BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY! And ya cant fix a bug that would take less then 5 mins to do. I swear this game was programmed by a 12 year old. But its still fun!"
modders make it better and free everything
great game
best
sed
old but good

theres a car with a funny looking front and it got turn into my nightmares
"there some mission that really make you ask ""why""   but there also sine best mission available... and obviosly C is true ending"

GGWP
very good concept of the game
What a save!

"I mean its alright, I just started playing idk"
I guess Rockstar is finally done milking the sh*t out of this game.
this game is inspired from real world. but it is not good for kids minimum age is 18+

"Don't bother to enjoy Online gameplay in public lobbies. Modders will do every annoying thing to mess with random people. They will change your car modifications, apartment and any other property interior and other details that you've spend in-game money and essentially time on. Rockstars tolerance towards cheating is unmatched. So, there are 3 options: be a cheater yourself, only play with a friend group in invite-only sessions or download a FiveM. In my experience, worst than Battlefield V cheating-wise."
"very bad too much cheater on playing online , worst GTA"
fun game
too sexy things in it

"It can be frustrating at times, so you need to go in with the right attitude and it is good fun. Be wary of Oppressor kids zooming around and blowing you up, and by a Deluxo and they will stop pretty quickly."
Solid Game Developer. Can't wait for the next one.
nice game!

Nice and great game 👍

Great game! get it! 100+%
"THIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS, LET ME LOAD INTO A FUCKING GAME. IT DOESN'T TAKE 15 MINUTES TO LOAD INTO A FUCKING GAME. FIX YOUR GAME. EVERYTIME I OPEN THE GAME, IT TAKES HALF AN HOUR TO JOIN A SESSION JUST TO BE CRASHED BY A HACKER, ONLY TO LOAD INTO THE FUCKING GAME AGAIN."

"Grand Theft Auto V isn't just a game, it's a cultural phenomenon, a testament to the boundless creativity of the human spirit. So grab your controller or keyboard, buckle up, and prepare for the ride of a lifetime, because GTA 5 is an experience that'll stay with you long after the credits roll."
"Alright, listen up gamers because Grand Theft Auto V is not just a game, it's a whole freaking experience! Picture this: a sprawling, open-world city just waiting for you to explore, cause chaos, and live out your wildest criminal fantasies. From heart-pounding heists to epic car chases and everything in between, GTA V throws you into a world where the possibilities are endless. And let's not forget the characters - they're like something out of a blockbuster movie, each with their own story and personality. Oh, and did I mention the online mode? It's like stepping into a virtual playground with your friends, causing mayhem together or competing in wild challenges. Seriously, if you haven't played GTA V yet, what are you waiting for? Get ready to unleash chaos and have the time of your life!"
games good just needs a lot of time to get anywhere

Good game

I get too much boom 💥 💥 💥 💥
good game need more anime girls
The game forces you to need other players to run your empire. Other p[layers are toxic a-holes. Not really much fun. Also the missions are super lazy. They just spawn endless npcs and toss them at you. No real thought went into the missions. Game is like a 5/10. Gets boring fast.
"a time capsule to ~2011, the younger Millennial/elder Zoomer's holy grail containing precious sips of a demented but still nostalgia worthy past some distance from release a lot of the social commentary is needlessly acerbic (thanks brits; let's see Paul Allen's vitriol about contemporary UK ""culture"") and hasn't held up well but it's lush and as coated in it as the billboard laden west coast highways from which the game's well-researched setting and landscape spring from Online? Online Gaming? Gaming Online? GTAO is still a hollow mess but the sheer joy of mucking around in the game engine with the boys carries it through. support your local hacker alhamdulillah"
people play it
amaizing game cant wait till the other one comes out..
Amazing game to play with your friends plus with the mod servers 👍🏾
DANK GAME
for sure it is good wagman

"Fly my helicopter to my full sized submarine, land inside, take my mini submarine out of  my full sized submarine and drive it to shore where my F-35 is waiting, fly that to my hangar on the military base where I store it and pull out my Apache Gunship, fly that to my underground facility in a wind farm field where I pull out my jet pack and fly to my skyscraper office for the business i own and enter my 9 tier/3 story garage filled with everything from Super cars to F1 and weaponized/flying/underwater capable cars. I mean that barely scratches the surface. GTA 5 has no right to be this deep, but here we are lol"

"Man I love this game there's nothing wrong with it, however I cant play the game anymore. as a new player hackers are getting more common and anytime I join a online session there's sometimes a random hacker that boosts my level from 12 to 34 and from 49 to 56. And Rock-star wont do shit. It only bothers me because i'm new. Just make sure to join private sessions from story-mode or just pray you get a server hack-free."

"If you haven't played GTA 5 in 2024, what have you been doing with your life!  Fantastic singleplayer mode that has an incredible story and well written characters with tons of side activities to do.  An awesome online mode thats still being updated with new stuff to this day.  Theres no reason to not pick this game up, especially on sale."

fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone knows about GTA V so if youre looking at reviews to buy... where have you been? Obviously this game is great with a good story mode with three different characters. Only this i wish was different was me getting account reset a few years ago because i bit the bullet on a money glitch. It was all my fault and i lost the account i had since the 360 days. I barely play anymore because of that. YEARS of progress lol so dont do glitches and youll be good
it's terrible
Single player story is pretty great with lots of little quests and activities to do.  Multiplayer has gotten a lot better as there are more ways to make money that don't require 3 other players.
I like it

"Title: ""GTA 5: The Great Account Heist - An Epic Fail-o-rama!""  Review:  ⭐️☆☆☆☆  ""Welcome to the thrilling world of GTA 5, where the only heist happening is Rockstar stealing access to the game you paid for! Strap in, folks, because this is a rollercoaster ride of frustration and disbelief.  So, there I was, ready to dive into the criminal underworld with my trusty mouse and keyboard, only to discover that my access pass was kidnapped by the nefarious Rockstar account. It's like buying a ticket to the movies, but the usher locks the theater door, and the popcorn machine is guarded by a grumpy troll demanding a secret handshake that I've long forgotten.  Attempting to rescue my game from the clutches of the elusive Rockstar account was like trying to outsmart a criminal mastermind, only this time the criminal mastermind is a forgotten email address. I sent messages to customer support, and their response time made the speed of a snail on a leisurely Sunday stroll seem like a bullet train.  GTA 5 now sits in my Steam library like an untouchable gangster surrounded by a digital forcefield. I can almost hear it taunting me, ""You can look, but you can't touch, sucker!""  Rockstar, you've turned my virtual crime spree into a tragic comedy of errors. It's not Grand Theft Auto; it's Grand Theft My Sanity. I half expect to see my character in-game, standing on a virtual street corner with a sign that reads, 'Will work for access to my own game.'  In conclusion, fellow gamers, if you enjoy a good caper, make sure it's within the game itself and not a digital battle to reclaim access to what you've rightfully purchased. As for Rockstar, I hope they find their moral compass – it's probably hidden in a forgotten password vault guarded by virtual dragons.""  Message @Mutis ﻿      to select"
YAY
still a alright game
"Great game. If you have a bunch of money, it's even more fun. Just play with your friends and watch out for griefers."
its a very good game for its price and it is realy fun if you play with friends
"I suffer doing cayo perico, fuck mk2"

best game
takes me back to playing this on my ps4 in my sophomore/junior year at my dads every other weekend. miss those simpler times.   cant wait for the new one!
very good
"To show how much I love this game - I played for around 350~ hours before I even bothered to play through the story. It is such an incredibly fun game, and I didn't expect how captivating the story would be. I just finished the entire story for the first time and am immediately restarting the game to play through it again.  I cannot recommend this game enough. Online mode is a little wacky, but still fun. And singleplayer was absolutely incredible. I don't remember a time when a game made me feel just this hard for its characters.  Absolutely one of my favourite games of all time. I thought people were overhyping it, but it's honestly not hyped up enough."
Absolutely amazing :3
my friend gave it to me and blew me up several times
Great Story
"just play, it's good"

"It is unfortunate that an advanced cheat provider who purchased the complete source code of Grand Theft Auto V from a leaker would develop cheats that far exceed the anti-cheats of the GTAV developers. They can crash on the computers of players they don't like, they can corrupt data, and they can even corrupt cloud-saved data if they can hack into the cloud. The only version of this game that has been popular and successful is the console version. In the PC version, there is always at least one modder in every session. GTAV has events, and depending on the cheats used by the modder, they can irreversibly corrupt an entire session and potentially have a negative impact on performance. A good friend of ours has unraveled why only PCs experience casino robberies and other heists and unusual events within a session. The modder is unknowingly inhibiting script events and network events necessary for activity in the session with the functionality of the protection section in the mod menu he is using. Did you see empty roads with NPC cars completely gone in your session? Did you enter a robbery or mission and get stuck in an endless loading loop and eventually get kicked out of the mission with a network error? Crashes despite being on a very high end computer? Did you become unable to walk, lose your weapon, or switch weapons when in the same session with a particular player? No, all of these are not coincidental. Behind those major errors and supposed bugs, ignorant modders are interfering with the scripting and networking events necessary to keep the session active and maintained. The session is not well controlled and can be destroyed. Rockstar Games removed 95% of its anti-cheat content around late 2023 because the source code for the Rockstar anti-cheat was leaked. The remaining 5% of the anti-cheat is probably the part that Rockstar really cares about, protecting Rockstar's profits and game logic, which validates the amount of money given in money drops and missions. I for one am not holding my breath for GTA6.  Because Rockstar Games was looking for technicians who are familiar with networking related issues when they were looking for technicians. I am sure GTA VI will also use P2P connections. Rockstar Games is a garbage company that only cares about money, not players' opinions! Get the hell out of business??"
great game you have probably heard that from everybody lol but my biggest complaint was the fact that there was no story mode dlc (also the fact gta 6 isnt coming to pc on launch)
loading screen simulator
One of the best games in this century!!!! loved it........
great game. the benchmark has been set very high lets see if gta 6 will surpass this masterpiece

It is a nice game but will be much better if there have been flc so i can travel from Los Santos to Liberty City and others and for flc so guy like me can play as female in single player and buys stuff like in gta online and for gta online all it needs to be in it so you so i can travel from Los Santos to Liberty City and others thats should be a flc for this game and make it better.
really good game.
One thing to say for anyone who buys GTAV PC. Download FiveM and connect it through GTAV so you can play GTAV RP servers. Youre welcome.

"One of the greatest games of all time. Story is incredibly engaging, funny, and well written. Voice acting is some of the best in the industry. Driving is fun, walking/running around is fun, flying is fun, shooting is fun - most mechanics of this game were designed around truly being fun and feel great to even the casual gamer. And it all runs incredibly smoothly even on my Steam Deck at a constant 90 fps with absolutely no issues. Holds up extremely well graphically in 2024."
"This game is great if you love hackers and modders. Every session I've tried to plasy for 2 weeks has had some jack-a$$ modder in it. Every. Single. Session. Until Rockstar gets a handle on it, I'm done with this game. Its sad, because its a great game except for the a##holes."
cool game

"I loved this game. So many fun times and shenanigans were had.  Unfortunately I can't recommend it anymore. RockStart/TakeTwo are basically abandoning PC, I can only assume to get people to move to console. Or Money. Probably money."
goooood
"First time i played this game was on a ps4 when i was 12, now im 38 and i am suviere racist and commiting tax evasion. When i was 15 i robbed my first bank. When i was 17 i killed my first hooker. When i was 20 i moved to LA. When i was 24 i snorted cocaine for the first time. When i was 27 i became the leader of one of the biggest gangs of LA. When i was 32 i discovered masturbating, and it was surprisingly nice. when i was 34 i married a beatuíful girl from Miami. When i was 35 she cheated on me and i divorced her. when i was 36 i met a new girl whom was perferct in every single way. Last year when i was 37, the new love of my life killed my whole family. Now that i am 38 years of age i will commit suicide because the oline mode in this fucking game is FUCKING GARBEGE. Goodbye."
I love sex
"Great game, with nice graphics and good exploration features .The only downside is it gets boring after 10 hours"

"The single player for this is about what you'd expect for GTA. The mechanics are pretty tight.  The online part of the game is where they put the burnt of their effort for the past ten years, and that's really good.  However, Rockstar really do things by half measures. As it stands, the PS5/Xbox One X version of the game has loads of content they just never ported to PC, the online content never made it to the single player, making it a vastly inferior experience, and even small quality of life things, like setting defaults for the weapon wheel, have never been implemented in the online mode.  You'd think that with the crunch culture and worker exploitation they practice, they'd have the time :|  As it stands, I'd say, if you want to play the Online mode, play on PS5."
es ist ein sehr gutes spiel man hat spass das zu spielen

I wonder what this game would be like if it took place in 1899?

"One of my favourite games. This game have great Story , good graphics.  Very well optimized runs nicely. I like how Rockstar made story for three main characters and how the story is connected between characters. I give this game 9/10."

What can I say? It's GTA V
good game.
best game of all time . things could be more affordable . if rock star reads this hook me up with some money so i can play the missions in online mode . it is so hard to earn any money because everyone just wants to kill each other and wait around for a modder to give them stuff instead of doing any work . you guys at rock star have created an amazing online plying experience but make it too hard to get enough money to enjoy the many features offered in the game .
its fun to play
Its ok
do i even need to say anything?

Trust bro
Rockstars social club is a joke.  I can now no longer play any Rockstar games because my  Rcokstar social club account was apparently hacked and taken over.  Now when I try to launch any of those games I am told the account is assigned to another social club account and I cannot play it.  I spent a lot of time dealing with Rockstar support and provided screen shot after screen shot proving ownership of my steam account and the original social club account.  I also included proof of purchase of both  games.  After proving ownership repeatedly I was told I did not prove ownersip and essentially to take a hike and have a nice day.  The ticket was then immediately closed and I was not even allowed a follow up.  WIll never support anything Rockstar ever again.  I own the games and they are on my steam account and still cannot play them because of Rockstar.  I spent hours online doing research to resolve it myself and its clear this is a widespread problem that Rockstar doesn't care about.

No review needed.
game doesn't work and has many issues when launching
Amazing. Just amazing I got the criminal enterprise pack and it was soooo worth it!
IT'S GTA ENOUGH SAID....
Online is decent enough but the story is amazing.

"Terrible support, bigoted content and poorly built software. This game stopped working three years ago, probably specifically because of Rockstar's dumb game launcher. I've tried all sorts of bogus troubleshooting that rockstar support tried to offer, none of which worked, and I've repeated this process every year or so with no improvements. Don't bother."
"If Rockstar could actually program and or optimize a game properly, we may be able to see some betterment in this field of gaming, but with nerfs to everything in order to steer people towards shark cards WHILST the game is so poorly optimized and bugged, just play it for the specific abuse this company offers."

"Modders make the game almost unplayable. Causing you to jump from session to session or hideout in your aparment (which still wont save you depending on the modder). Being nuked or insta-killed while trying to transport goods really kills the elements of play that make the game so immersive.  it's not that I dont recommend the game, it's just that it will never be what it once was.   I recommend this game if you enjoy:  - GTA  - Heisting with your friends  - Criminal enterprising  - Modding Car  - Racing, Drifting, Car meets  - pain... loss... & suffering    can't wait for GTA 6!"
Good game for killing sometime.
gooc
Very good very nice
super fun. mostly just stealing vehicles and driving around because the driving physics are amazing. The story mode is also fun.
bitches go brrrrr with railgun on a lvl 5 player k ys

too good game
recomended
Its fun

hate the goid damn spiks
"This review is specifically about GTA Online. The story mode is an easy 4/5 and I'd recommend everyone to play it nevertheless how shit the online mode is.  The online is just ass. And I don't even mean because of the cash grab/life killer it has become. It's more about the retarded shit Rockstar added over time, that turned that mode into a true fuckfest, and it all started with the Oppressor.  But as if jerks flying around on rocket puking jet bikes, aimlessly blowing everything and everyone to pieces wasn't bad enough, Rockstar also doesn't seem to care much about the abundance of small dick cheaters, who make your gaming experience in public sessions even more miserable. Do yourself a favor, play the story mode, fuck the rest."
i like it buy why cant i buy a normal version  of the game for a friend i have a get a starter pack witch makes me spend more then i want
This is the best game for playing in your free time and for recording as well . The environment is properly based on Real Life cities making it more realistic . New mission makes it even exciting and i will suggest you to choose the Loud way in heists as it is amazing
"much thugs to kill, muy bien"
Shark card hungry Rockstar

bro its gta 5 ofc its good
This game is so good I absolutely love it 😁
its a good game for people who want to have some good crack (not the drug)
old GTA was better
"Prepare for GTA VI in 2025, all games release in 2025 will be destroyed by Rockstar"
"Too many cheaters now.  If you are OK with cheating, you will have a good time, but if not, then you won't.  Between my 2 accounts I have over 2k hours, and I have really stopped playing about 5 years ago.  Such a shame, this was such a great game."
Its fun but I really would love a built in mod installer
it's gta v
Aaaa because can

ITS GOOD DAWG
"Haven't completed the GTAV Story yet but instead played GTA Online with my big brother! Its a really fun game and we had a lot of fun and laughter. Whether its us getting chased by the cops and our heli crashed on a tree, or us killing eachother. I'm so glad that there's a invite only session!  Also the story 30% of it was good and I can see that the story near the end will be GOOD."

"Arguably upsetting... Grand Theft Auto V, was amazing in 2013. But that's just it... 2013.  It's 2024, still has a lot of playability, but GTA: Online [b][i]ruined[/i][/b] Grand Theft Auto V. And it's all thanks to the general public. We could have had a few singeplayer DLCs, but instead we got Shark Cards. The people spoke with their wallet and Take-Two listened. Unfortunate, especially considering now GTA: Online is virtually unplayable thanks to negligence. I would've recommended it a long time ago, but if you're not interested in singleplayer, don't touch this game.  Edit:\\ Play it on console if you want to play online."

"A Timeless Classic: Grand Theft Auto V  My journey with the Grand Theft Auto franchise began in 2016 when I was first introduced to GTA 5 at my friend's house. Watching him skillfully evade the police, diving into storm drains, ignited my fascination with the game. Back then, I owned an Xbox 360 E, a Christmas gift from 2014. Surprisingly, GTA 5 wasn't my first encounter with the series; that honor belonged to GTA San Andreas on the PS2, emulated through PCSX2. I vividly recall cruising around, soaking in the open-world experience. Later, I delved into GTA 4, experimenting with mods and further immersing myself in the franchise. Despite not fully engaging with the story mode, I was undeniably hooked. After watching all the cutscenes of GTA 5, I knew I had to play it. On December 21st, 2016, at the age of 13, I finally acquired a copy for my Xbox 360, albeit under the alias Franklin Clinton, as my mum wasn't keen on me playing a PEGI 18 game. Unfortunately, a damaged disc led me to purchase the digital version, marking the start of my story mode journey, which took me nine months to complete. In 2018, I received an Xbox One for Christmas, reigniting my passion for GTA 5. Transitioning to the newer console was bittersweet, especially with the closure of Xbox 360 servers, where I had amassed considerable wealth. However, the lure of enhanced graphics and gameplay on the Xbox One was undeniable. The year 2020 brought an unexpected gift when GTA 5 became available for free on the Epic Games Store. With my recent GPU upgrade to an Nvidia GTX 1650 Super, I seized the opportunity, knowing the game would run smoothly on my system. Fast forward to the present, and I've conquered the story mode on Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. Now, with the game on Series S, the thrill continues. Watching YouTuber VideoKames navigate through her first playthrough of the game was a delight, especially knowing that even Ned Luke, the voice actor for Michael, was tuning in. Grand Theft Auto V holds a special place in my heart, its missions never failing to evoke a smile or laughter. As I eagerly await Rockstar Games' next masterpiece, GTA 6, I know my love for this game will endure. Framing my GTA V map and hanging it on my wall will serve as a testament to the countless memories and joy it has brought me.   P.S. The PC version lacks the love and support seen in the current generation consoles. Despite having the ability for mods, I'm not a fan of how GTA Roleplay has overtaken what made this game special. Nevertheless, Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece, and Rockstar Games should be proud of their accomplishment."

why does a multi billion dollar company refuse to add a anticheat to online. still worth playing though

Imagine taking a million years to do anything because loading screens take so long. Then imagine being in a lobby where someone is guaranteed to be modding either making your life a living hell in game modes with god mode or just terrorizing you every time you spawn in. Not to mention very toxic lobbies.
hell yeah
It won't let me do the fun things and blow stuff up...
thumbs up
its kinda asss but in a kinda good way ig
Fun to mod!
A masterpiece ✨️

"It's GTA, it's still worthwhile playing whilst waiting for 6 to release"
Perfect. Just Perfect.
"Rub salt all over the chicken. Let it stay for 15 minutes. Heat the oil in a cooking pot. Prepare the batter. Start by pressing a fork on the chicken cube until it is completely squashed. Combine it with warm milk. Stir until well blended. Set aside. Combine flour, baking powder, garlic powder, salt, and ground black pepper. Mix well using a fork or a wire whisk. Set aside. Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl. Add the milk mixture. Continue to beat until all the ingredients are all incorporated. Add half of flour mixture. Whisk. Add the remaining half and whisk until the texture of the batter becomes smooth. Dredge the chicken in flour and then dip in batter. Roll it again in flour until completely covered. Fry in medium heat for 7 minutes per side. Remove from the pot and put in a plate lined with paper towel. This will absorb the oil. Serve with ketchup or gravy. Share and enjoy!"
Don't do online
"beating up prostitutes, killing cops, and waiting 12 years for the next installment? idk its kinda cool ig"

Grand Theft Auto... Five?
"ROCKSTAR is a bunch of stupid sell outs and the multiplayer game is the worst thing I have ever played. there servers are full or script kitties modding and making the multiplayer game terrible, if you try to cheat to give yourself back what a script kitty stole from you you get banned.  rockstar is a joke, they defiantly lots there original vibe and sold out"
its full shit dont plaly
NICE
"I do love playing GTA V and I've been playing GTA V for years. I love story mode and online, but I do think that there should not be as many modders as there is in GTA online, although GTA V and online is fun to play."
entertaining game
its very good with mods irl gun sound effects real cop cars etc
its good game
Absolutely Amazing Gaming Experience . Liked this Game so much

I LOVED THE GAME

Golo govno al aj ne smrdi tako lose.

good game but its abit overhyped due to youtubers adding mods but yeah worth buying (in discount).......
)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
"This game used to be great fun, I loved playing it and had lots of amazing experiences with my friend. Until they changed it about 2 months ago. They fucked up big time. Our main source of income - the Cayo Perico heist - had its setup cost quadripuled, lots of ui and menu changes made the ui and menus really confusing and idk what happened, but the graphics changed somehow - I used to have the deafult settings and had pretty smooth gameplay, no major lag spikes, but today I turned GTA on, I didn't change my settings and it lagged like pure hell about half the time. Also, it looked awful, which it didn't before, like I had texture quality at its lowest and reflections at the highest, even though I had them both at Very High. And maybe worst of all - they banned my friend for basically no reason. He and I were playing on a private server and he used some mod to just SPAWN VEHICHLES, not give or take money, not get access to a new property, just spawn vehichles, which we destroyed afterwards, and 3 days later, Rockstar emails him, saying he has been banned for 30 days AND had his character WIPED. Keep in mind, he had never cheated before and didn't even do it on a public server and didn't change his stats in any way. AND, he had hundreds of hours of playtime, where he legitly got a facility, nightclub, Kosatka, multiple milions and a lot of other things, including a shit ton of cars. He lost all of it. For spawning a few cars, planes and a tank. In short, Rocktar Games are a leech that wants to suck as much money from you as possible and then wipe it, so you have to buy it again."
great game lots of fun to play with friends
the game is amazing and good for people that like having trouble with the  police or causing mayhem and shooting random people
i died
cd key change
"This game was completely taken over by cheaters that ruin everyone's game. They kick everyone out of the server, blow you up out of nowhere, put you in the cage. Another problem of this game are bugs, forever loading screen, and game freeze. It's been 13 years since this game came out but they still cannot fix shit. If Rockstar doesn't pull their heads out of their asses the game is gonna go to shit"
nice game although its a 2013 game.... races are the most amazing things.
"Nobody has ever not heard of GTA V. It is amazing for a reason. Make sure to have a top end AMD Ryzen chip (hopefully 6600H) and a GeForce RTX 3050 (i bought my laptop for 60,000 rupees) for the best and cheapest possible gameplay."

Love discussing the cuts for the heist with my buddies. They act like a kid at my school that brags abt dracos.
"It's a game that I can play with my friends. Sometimes, I like that. Sometimes, I don't. I like the interaction and the ability to play by myself"

BHAI JAHAR GAME HAI YAH
i  love this game
SOO GOOD
the game is not starting
Story mode for GTA V is amazing.  GTA Online is too unstable to play. It crashes constantly and has really slow loading times
gggggggggggggggooooooooooooooooodddddddddd
too many hackers
I bought this game when it was at heavy discount and this is the only reason i bought It as it was so expensive and everyone knows that how great this game is and with mods it goes Next Level!
just a game
"Even though I don't play it as often these days, this game holds such a special place in my heart. It's not just about the missions or the cars; it's about the moments spent with friends, hustling together to afford those dream rides. There's something about cruising in first-person mode, especially when it's raining outside or as the sun sets, with the radio playing in the background—it feels like I'm right there in the moment.  I've never really explored private servers; I've heard they can be iffy, and using accelerators for foreign ones isn't my thing either. So, I stick to the official servers. I got into this game back in high school, and now, here I am in my sophomore year of college. While I used to get tired of it quickly, as life has gotten busier, this game has become my sanctuary, a place to escape to when things get overwhelming.  It's more than just a game to me; it's a timeless escape. I'm eagerly awaiting GTA 6, and I have faith that Rockstar will keep pushing the boundaries and giving us even more ways to immerse ourselves in their worlds. That's the beauty of gaming—creating these unforgettable adventures."
goated
my game is not lunching
yep
i can blew up people futuristic bike :D
just online is great
GTA V is one of the best games ever made. Period. why are you reading this instead of playing it?!?!
a stripper sucked my dick
bababooey
yes.
Meh dont get the hype i only downloaded this game for the virtual strippers 10/10 would spank my monkey again
i viciously spank my monkey to this game

"The PC version is horrible if you intend to play Online. Too many cheaters/modders. Police often spawns on top or in front of you, detecting you immediately and making it impossible to escape. Playing with friends is often buggy, mainly when trying to invite each other to jobs or heists. GTA V Story mode is fine but also buggy at times. Get the console version if you can."
gran taft outro
"I downloaded the game, tried to play it, and it installed a bunch of documents on my desktop (to make the game launch, I guess) and also DELETED SOME OF MY FILES AND FOLDERS WITHOUT SENDING THEM TO THE RECYCLING BIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I had a short film idea that wasn't on my desktop, but got wiped from my computer, anyway.  I got them back, thanks to OneDrive, but now I'm terrified to download and try opening the game ever again!  If anyone knows why this happened, and how to prevent this from happening again, please let me know, because I want GTA VI, but don't think It'll be available for the Switch."
hello
"Game made with true passion, and detail."
ITS GOOD WAITING FOR GTA 6
MY childhood dream
i get random urges to run npcs over with my car
yea
good as long as you mod it or play 5m
Play this before Gta 6
"It's alright. I paid money, I got game, I played game, I made friends, I stopped playing game. Still good, but too many hackers in multiplayer."
The games offers a lot of varaiety ofcourse there isn't a man who doesn't heard the name GTA and the game worths every penny it has very much variety and Disclaimer: Dont use the cayo perico heist glitch you will get bored do the cayo perico its ok but dont use the glitch you will be easily bored if you use the glitch the game supposed to last atleast a year or 2 that is how they made the game dont do the glitch if you use the glitch it will be good at start after sometime you wont play i used to usae glitch then i started playiong with another account of rockstars from scratch
My favorite at strip club nwys add me and give me a account please🫸🫷(couldnt afford pray emoji)

"look... the game is fun. Incredibly fun! The story is great, and if you don't know how the game ends by now, either you play with cheats only, or you've been living under a rock. or both. The only complaint i have is for online and the people who play it. Some people are there to have a good time, they'll race around the city, talk, and generally they're good fun. That's the kind of person you friend on social club and do jobs with. Then there's the other crowd. Modders, griefers, and trolls. These people intend to make life hell for any online player regardless of who it is. There are some cases where you meet modders who will give you money and RP to allow you to have more fun in GTA's online without wasting your own money, but these people are few and far between. If you run into any of the group (save for a good modder) your best bet is to block the player on social club and find a new lobby. If you do meet a modder who will give you money, you would be advised to friend them to hopefully gain as much money as possible."
rfff

"This game is super fun where you can do WHATEVER you want. Like shooting an npc in the back of his head with a revolver. You can then run him over with your $1,000,000 car. 10/10"

good graphic for strip club
fuN GAME
game is easy i got to rank 300 randomly who knows how
its a really cool game with a lot of friendly pople
if there are no griefers in your session it could be the best game of your gta life
ME no like
"I like the idea of this game. I like the concept. This is the best driving game on the market! Better than all of the other driving games. I wish there were more things to do for money as a single player. I think it should be easier to make $250k - $500k by yourself. The little moneys are fine but they really don't allow you to grow to become a billionaire (which is what you are trying to do). I wish there were more businesses that could be set up as a CEO, or a Boss. I wish there was a version, or extension pack made for adults over 18."
alright game

great game bad modders
very good game but also very bad game at the same time
"This game is full of damn modders, Every time i have tried GTA online i have always either been greeted by someone who does not have a life or i am just given a bunch of money EVEN WHEN I DON'T WANT IT. And worse yet after about 30 days of not playing i log on and see i have to reactivate my account. easy right? NO, NOT EASY because apparently rock-star likes to send you irredeemable codes that i have to put in the rock-star games thing and WORSE YET EVERY NAME IS TAKEN. ALL OF EM. u wont find a single decent one and WORSE YET rock-star is a pain in the ass in general because when i have to close my game on extremely short notice the game likes to verify: ""AR YOU sure YOu waNT to QuIT BRO"" like YEA NO SHIT ASS HOLE THAT'S WHY I PRESSED ALT F FOUR DUMB-ASS Bitch. spread the word about this USELESS ass game and GTA 6 will be shit too i fucking hate you rock-star you ignorant pieces of shit!!!!!  EXTRA NOTES: also cheaters frequently like to disable your internet from time to time so get that refund as SOON as you can guys this game SUCKS. Not worth the fifteen pound at ALL. i wouldnt get it if i was held at gunpoint."
this game is therapy
akll
fucking goat game
Good game but online is ruined by hackers. Can't go five minutes without someone tp killing the entire lobby. Very frustrating.
Whatever
goog
there are modders but some are friendly and some kick you off the game if you get those type i wouldnt recommend the game to them and there are different types of players the grinders the kind players and griefer players
Why do I have to play dress up everytime I start a mission as Michael? The fact I have to google what specific outfits I have to wear for what specific mission single handedly ruins the game for me. I also just finished playing 1 set of the tennis minigame with Amanda that took 45 fucking minuets and was the hardest thing Ive ever had to do in any video game ive ever played. GTA 6 better be good because replaying this game in 2024 made me realize how awful it is.
oppressors kids worse then a hackers.
VERY FUN GAME
hehe gun go brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrb
ita gta
I only play online lol
Great game wish it was eaiser to get money though

IT'S  STILL A GREAT GAME.

"Played for over 10 years on both PS3 and PC, still one of my favourite games to play when I just want something relaxing to play. Yes, the money online is a grind, but when you just wanna do something chill and easy, it's not too bad to do now and then.   Do need a pretty substantial PC spec to run it at max, but most PC's would probably be fine these days. Really big fan of this iconic game, can't wait for GTA IV."
i like this game so mucch beaccuse its very entertaining
The game crashes when I pess ALT+F4
AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
shit fire stewpid
very good game better than volorant in my opinion
My left nut has fallen
"игра имба, зашел, взяли, убили, взорвали, задавили, чел заманил в машину и взорвал, купил машину, и взорвали, и все это за 30 минут. Топчик, рекомендую"
"Online gameplay is just too much of a security vulnerability.  Overall I'd spent less than an hour online and got teleported to the ocean, promptly killed, then something or another happened to corrupt my online account.  A game with security vulnerabilities of this nature (which based on reddit discussions have been unpatched for more than a year) shouldn't be available for sale let alone installed.  Hard pass.  This is even worse than Battlefield V"
the game is good but yall need to add better strip club fr
EVERYTHING!!
its pretty cool
tussing
ME NOW:  life = NO  crazy/insane = Yes
the game is fking noicerr
"The game is great, but the hackers ruin it before you can enjoy it. There is no public session without a hacker blowing up the whole lobby. Rockstar should totally do something about that anti-cheat."
It is good👌
I LOVE KILLING PEOPLE !!!!!!!
fire since day one

"Michael is hot and can go barefoot. His feet are beautiful to see. Gameplay is ok. I didn't bother about the story, only Michael's feet."
"GTA V is a very fun and immersive game. Even though I've just started I really like this game. I used to play it on the Xbox 1 but now I have it on a good pc, I love this game even more"

the game is amazying i love to paly it
G.O.A.T
fun to kill npcs
its highly recommendable
"My go-to game when I've had enough of the real world and want to escape reality for some time. Expands well upon that one mechanic every other GTA title missed - immersion. Drive around the posh Vinewood streets looking for exotic sports cars or explore the Grand Senora Desert and expect random encounters with muggers or hitchhikers, or take a U-turn and climb Mt. Chiliad, to feel on top of the world. The game comes with endless hours of game play even after completing all the missions, and the first-person mode coupled with your own tracks makes even aimless driving feel fun. The only downside is the wanted level system, which activates even when you stealthily kill a random NPC in the middle of the desert in the dead of the night. Nevertheless, the game is efficiently optimized on all its ports, which allows it to run even on low-end machines. The game play physics is spectacular, but in no way you must expect it to be near real-life since GTA V's not supposed to be a simulation game. In the end, this game will make you forget all your real-life problems for a while, as you step into the shoes of either Franklin, Michael or Trevor and feel the Los Santos sensation."
its a good game just buggy
its gta v
gchv
i JUST love this game aspecally the story
Good game overall
"too many hackers running around online play, got semi trucks and jets falling out of the sky to people forcing my car to spawn in front of them. or my character turning into a plant. they troll you"
nice game. mods are nice as well but they are hard to download you cant just go onto vortex and do it that way or atleast not for me. online is ok but people are mostly annoying but its fine i guess. i cant be bothered typing a whole review because im trying to get the nuke operator skin in cod warzone. if anyone wants to help me you can comment and i will respond... eventually.
"It's fun depending on the type of session modder, it's bearable tho"
too musch cheater
last one stop
this game has everything that i can do here instead of real life
"You are better off playing this on console if you want to play in regular lobbies that aren't hacked or modded.  I played the crap out of this on Xbox and was excited for the steam experience when I built my PC but man, little did I know of the pain & misery that was waiting when I got into an online open lobby.   I've only ever modded Minecraft & Terraria and that has been a limited experience as I don't get the same value or fulfillment as others do, after so many hours I become bored, it's not the real experience & it's just not my thing to hack or mod.   Every regular lobby will have one or more people running hacks or some mod so they can't die or blow up. I just got on after months because of the same situation. I try to mess around in a normal lobby only to run into someone that is invincible. It never fails!!! Then of course I go to another lobby only for the same thing to happen again leading to me eventually getting off the game after just being on for under 1 HOUR!!!   The main hours I've put in on steam are for doing heists or something that doesn't involve others, which has completely taken away from making friends. joining crews & just in general trying to play the game normal like how I did on console, I'm at the point where I am truly questioning why I even try to play this on PC.  Rockstar really failed with the Steam version of this Online game-play. I truly hope GTA VI will be an improvement but I highly doubt it, so I'm not holding my breath and plan to return to Xbox for the next game so I can avoid the pathetic trolls & no lives of the ""PC World"""
"Dude, the game has been out for over a decade, why are you looking at the reviews?"

"Even years after its release, its still a fun game. And add fivem and nopixel for the RP side of things and it just gets better. Some of the mods released for this game have been brilliant. GTA 6 will have high standards to beat if GTA 5 is anything to go by."
Play this then you will know why this is masterpiece
"this shit hard asf, im fw it"

"The american dream, viewed through the lens of 3 wildly different characters who share similar occupations. Even these years later, its signature satire still holds up today. Pick it up, play through the story once, maybe twice, and then shut it off again and enjoy the fun memories.  As for the online version, don't touch it. Unless you shell out extra for a 3rd-party mod menu and pray you don't get banned, you are going to get crushed by everyone who does do that - and just generally feel terrible the whole time."
just buy this shit its worth it trust fr

"This game has such a good story line and you just have to try it for yourself to experience it, it's actually one of my favorite games right now."
Coolest game ever!
Its fun to grind but the servers suck and will disconnect you randomly denying you hours of grinded money
Been playing GTAV since launch on the Xbox 360 and have done over 20 playthroughs   Story 7.5/10 felt jumpy just jumping from new bad guy to new bad guy Franklin could've had more missions with the CGF and shit more backstory instead of just Micheal and Trevor fighting about something 9 years old but good overall  Characters 9/10 Some very iconic and memorable character in all of gaming  World 8/10 Most of it is mountains but apart from that its very atmospheric and immersive  Overall 8/10 solid GTA Game cant wait to see what Rockstar cooks up with GTA 6
I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
haha people go boom
super fun and adiddive

"The individual game is great, Online is buggy and FULL of people who mod the game to cheat and it crashes constantly. Catch it on sale and play the single player, but play something that requires a subscription, it keeps the basement trolls at bay if they have to use their mom's credit card to get on"

GTA Online is what you switch to when you're a little too old for roblox
1000% worth buying the game massive story line so you dont get bored and its sooo fun and some times your get hyped up
"Playing online with your friends is a very fun activity to do but the person i played with was repeatedly killing me when i kept telling him i had no more ammo in anny of my guns i think he should be restricted to play grand theft auto for at least 5 days,also he kept trying to hit me with an rocket launcher he knows i have an very little amount of guns to fight with so it is definadly un fair for him to do that i will continue to play but rockstar i need you todo somthing about him ""bullying"" people that are very low level and cant have or do certain things other wise the game is very fun but i wanna know how to ropleplay on fivem i could not figure out i will like some advise on how to get an server and intructions on how to play as well thank you rockstar when is gta 6 comeing out i hope soon."

So fun and many new challenges and yolo whatever you want. I couldnt wait for GTA 6
i like doing and selling drugs so this is a good game cuz it has both of them
"This game is wonderful, and tons of fun with friends. The quintessential crime simulator, and it's just as good as anyone else will say it is. I will definitely continue playing it with friends for quite a long time and encourage you to also give it a try. That being said, I've encountered a few big issues which I think really hurt it.  1. It's intended for multiplayer. Not necessarily a bad thing until you see that for some missions or businesses, you have to use multiple separate vehicles. It turns what could just be a simple longer mission into an enormous headache over traveling, backtracking, and doing the same trip 3 times.   2. The controls are inconsistent and were imagined by a thrice-lobotomized maniac. Sometimes, it's E. Other times, it's enter. Sometimes they make you use backspace, but then the escape key is needed. I was forced to agonize over delivering one package until I learned that that key they were prompting me was not enter nor backspace, but suddenly the RIGHT ARROW KEY.  3. SecuroServ bodyguards pay 100% OF MONEY THEY WOULD HAVE EARNED TO THEIR VIP (Non-mission/business one-off income was observed, but I haven't tested further). There is no toggle. This is not disclosed. I am now indebted to my friend because we wanted to to jobs in a group together."

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) stands as a true testament to the brilliance of Rockstar Games, setting a new standard for open-world gaming that few titles can match. Released in 2013, the game continues to captivate players with its unparalleled combination of gripping storytelling, immersive gameplay, and a meticulously crafted virtual world that oozes with detail.  The narrative unfolds through the eyes of three distinct protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor – each with their own unique personalities, backgrounds, and motivations. This innovative storytelling approach allows players to experience the narrative from multiple perspectives, creating a rich and dynamic storyline that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The character development is outstanding, making you emotionally invested in the fate of these antiheroes.  The game's open-world environment, the sprawling city of Los Santos, is nothing short of breathtaking. The level of detail is staggering, from the bustling urban streets to the serene beauty of the surrounding countryside. Whether you're exploring the city skyline, cruising through the Vinewood Hills, or engaging in high-speed chases across the desert, the world feels alive and dynamic, with every corner offering a new surprise.  GTA 5 boasts a diverse range of activities to keep players entertained for hours on end. From adrenaline-pumping heists to intense shootouts, leisurely rounds of golf to off-road races, the variety of missions and side activities is astonishing. The attention to detail extends to the radio stations, showcasing a wide array of genres and entertaining talk shows that enhance the immersive experience.  The multiplayer component, Grand Theft Auto Online, takes the experience to a whole new level. Joining forces with friends to complete heists, engaging in thrilling PvP battles, or simply cruising around the city in a customized vehicle adds an extra layer of excitement and longevity to the game. The constant updates and expansions introduced by Rockstar ensure that the online world stays fresh and engaging.  Visually, GTA 5 is a technical marvel. The graphics are stunning, showcasing the power of modern gaming hardware. The character models, vehicles, and environments are rendered with meticulous attention to detail, creating a visual spectacle that enhances the overall gaming experience.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece that has rightfully earned its place in the annals of gaming history. Rockstar Games has created a living, breathing world that transcends the boundaries of conventional gaming. With its compelling narrative, expansive open-world, and a plethora of activities, GTA 5 continues to stand as a shining example of what the gaming industry is capable of achieving. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or a casual player, Grand Theft Auto V is a must-play title that delivers an unforgettable and unparalleled gaming experience."

The level of detail in character models, environments, and lighting is breathtaking, and the game runs smoothly even during the most chaotic moments. The soundtrack complements the experience perfectly, featuring a diverse range of music that sets the tone for each moment, whether it's a high-speed chase or a contemplative drive through the city."

way too many god damn modders and rockstar doesnt seem to care
futuy
It's an amazing game fun to play and many things to do
"To many modders, to many grind missions. No fun for not a single family member"
seiii
"open world experience,and adaptive world for any rp games."
Fantastic game
Playing this game with a keyboard and mouse is torture and i want to reconsider breathing everytime im in a plane  Besides that the game is fine
"An entertaining game that's doesn't take itself too seriously while still being mostly grounded in a reality where crime runs rampant. The places the game really shines are in it's heists the characters plan. Namely casing a score, then acquiring the things required for the job, and then finally executing the heist itself. The game even gives you a couple options for each heist. The other big entertainment factor with the game is in the parodies of various things in the world, like the talk show and news radio commentary on things that are happening in the game. It makes the game world feel a bit more lived in and I can definitely see why GTA Online has cultivated a strong RP community from these things."
I saw my first pair of boobs because of this game.  10/10 would recommend
"buy the game for GTA story mode, GTA online mode, GTA Fivem (RP) and you can also install mods. Computer requirements are fine, normal nvidia graphic card such as mx series can run smoothly. Nice game if you like crime."
banning random people and lot of hackers in online
The beat games
Pessi approves.

"I really enjoyed this game, untill the company decided to steal all of my RockStar games. No access to old email and no help from support. Sucks big time."

"Grand Theft Auto Online, the multiplayer counterpart to GTA V, offers an expansive and dynamic online world. With a plethora of activities, heists, and customization options, it extends the game's longevity. However, occasional technical issues and balancing concerns aside, GTA Online remains a vibrant and engaging multiplayer experience in the iconic GTA universe. Since i have played this game for 300+ hours in just 2 months of buying the game i can confidently say the game is very nice and fun to play. Yes there are modders and cheaters but most of the businesses can be done in an invite only session and this provides a great security from griefers. DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN 2024 AFTER THE RELEASE OF GTA 6 TRAILER!!?? YES BECAUSE THIS GAME IS NOT DEAD YET AND WILL BE THERE FOR ATLEAST 2-3 YEARS COMING UP."
300 shot bam
the best game btw why is gta 6 on 2025? waaa but still PLAY GTA 5 ITS COL.
SO FUNNY
"Rockstar is notoriously shit at security. If you haven't played GTA in a while, your account has almost 100% been compromised by hackers. So what do you do? The only thing you can do is message Rockstar support. That shouldn't be an issue, but every time you reply to a ticket, you're talking to someone new. That means repeating yourself a dozen times, sending the same screenshots a dozen times. I have been talking to them for 5 days. I have sent them proof of purchase, proof I own the email account the Rockstar account was linked to, proof I've purchased Shark Cards. I've sent them screenshots of my Steam profile, screenshots of my Rockstar profile, screenshots of my friend requests... but the next day it's some new person talking to me, and they request the same exact information. It's crazy to me how they so easily allow someone into your account, but getting back into your own account is impossible. In my eyes, the issue is that they require you to use their bullshit, buttcheeks launcher, which has no benefit and only creates gaps in security. They said ""how about, instead of using Steams relatively safe and protected services, we make them sign up for our own shitty hacker-friendly launcher and then when their account inevitably gets hacked, maybe they'll just buy the game again.""  Buying a Rockstar game is just begging to have your information stolen by some man in China. Their support is so bad, I can't help but feel like its on purpose just to get you to make another account and re-buy the game."
so fun to play with friends
i still like the story mode
GG GIMANG BANG WINDAH BASUDARA
Grand Theft Auto 5 is the top most Best game i have ever played you need to play it NOW if you have not played it already

"FUN, GTA 6?"
The game is really good but it’s impossible to buy the game on pc without the stupid starter pack so i can’t gift it to my friend because the “bundle” with the starter pack costs $30 and i bought a $20 steam gift card because i thought i’d be able to gift it to him with that
Timeless game with a content filled online mode.
"Im not, not recomending it because of the kind of game it is no, GTA V is a great game and i reccomend that but not this specific one because the modders make this game unplayable sometimes"
i modded the game so its better
very good game 10/10 must try again

"A brilliant and hilarious satire on the hyper-capitalism and rampant consumerism of the United States, and how abandoning morals in the pursuit of wealth will leave you unfulfilled. Published by Rockstar Games."
online is amazing expect for griefers story is really good as well
luh game
e um exelente jogo para se jogar online e com amigos
"This game fuckin sucks, or Dit spel zuigt verdomme"
"its fun, thumbs up"
"Its impressive yes, but impressive is not the same thing as a fun and engaging experience. How do I know this? Because I dont remember much of anything except that there was a desert, a car dealership, and a man lounging beside a pool."
"So yeah, this was a lot more fun than I tought. I've played all GTA games since GTA London, played through a few. Dont think I will play through this as I got stuck in online.  As I prolly will spend another 100 hrs or so before I am fed up. Its been great value for money."
very good game amazing story and just fun to play without the story

本世纪最伟大的游戏之一
does not let me play gta online
interesting!!!!!!!!!!!
Cool
"I have had lots of fun hours playing this game online but unfortunately I am unable to recommend due to one big flaw on PC.  This game is plagued my modders online. These are the groups that modify the game play using software to cheat and ruin others play time. Public lobbies on GTA Online can't be played effectively on PC. This is a known problem and a controversial issue as many like to mod and do so without interfering with others. Unfortunately my experience has been often toxic individuals who are bored and have fun ruining others game play by cheating. There is a big difference between getting upset that people are killing you on an online game that is PvP against modders that use god mode and remotely blow you up so you have no chance.   So why so many fun hours playing? Simple, me and my friends go into a crew restricted online lobby. This is the only effective way to play this game. Unfortunately by doing this you can't meet people in the online public lobbies to join your crew or expand your friends.   I do have concerns for GTA 6 as if it has the same problems I am likely not to bother. It's a shame as the game has so much good potential and can be really fun but I would probably say get it on console where the modifications are restricted."

LOVED THIS GAME
The best game ❤️
if i die before gta 6 comes out ima be mad asf

"In a nutshell, GTA V is not just a game; it's an epic, a rollercoaster of fun, crime, and chaos. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or just looking for a good time, GTA V is worth every dime."
um dos melhores jogos de todos os tempos 👍👍

I like it but I want gta6 now the police mechanics are so broken and don't make sense.

GTA Online is really fun when you are not being attacked constantly by other players. The missions are fun but can get frustrating when you are a low rank. I highly recommend.

"The single player experience is top-notch, like knockin' back a cold one with your best bud. The story? Unbelievable. Every mission's got you grinnin' like mad.  Now, here's the genius move – they toss in an in-game stock market. It ain't the second coming of sliced bread, but it's pretty damn cool. You can play the market, make some dough, maybe even swim in millions or billions. But here's the thing, you end up drowning in cash like a lottery winner with nowhere to blow it. Singleplayer mode, though fantastic, feels a bit deserted after the story wraps up. Rockstar's updates forget about it like it's yesterday's news. Now, let's talk about the multiplayer, or as I like to call it, the school of life for young bloods. It's like a lesson in manners, respect, and sharing, but in a chaotic, online playground. If you want to enjoy it with mates, lock it down to a private session, unless you fancy a level +1000 twerp going all mafia boss on you.  And get this – you can buy a yacht in the game. Real boss move, huh? The top-tier one sets you back a cool $10,000,000. But here's the twist again – the most in-game money you can buy is $8,000,000, and that's gonna cost you a hundred real bucks. Talk about highway robbery in a game that's already bleeding your wallet dry.  I could go on and on about a game and a company that seem to have a PhD in squeezing every penny out of the fans, shutting down companies they once praised. But let's get straight to it. Singleplayer? Absolutely top-notch. Multiplayer? Stay away like it's the plague. GTA Online is like a case study proving that achieving world peace is easier than navigating that online circus. Cheers to the campaign, but keep your distance from the multiplayer madness."
very good but some of the players are hackers and so they mess with you but some other hackers give u money and levels so yea i would very recommend but just be careful
The game that allows modders to cheat online without banning them. (Still worth it)
IDK
Very stable game with no glitches at all and a very peaceful place when in online
this game is really fun and u should try it out
AMAZING!!!!!
its a nice game but it should fix some bugs
i liked this

"best game oat, masterpice if you got the money and you aint buying gta you just ruined you're life"
"good story overall, just don't play online unless you wanna rage :>"
"Singleplayer (story mode) is amazing with a lot of content. The story is fun to play and the amount of details in the game map is incredible!  Multiplayer (online) is a big letdown. The community is full of players looking to start fights for no reason, griefing is promoted, and excessive mods on PC break all game barriers. Vehicles are too expensive and money-making methods are mostly ineffective, except for the Cayo Perico heist. I play GTA Online alone more than with anyone else.  I suggest singleplayer over multiplayer, unless if you have a group of loyal friends to play with."
Dogshit

"Earlier game was kind of good. Cheats was rare. BUT TODAY... (22.01.24) Servers are full off cheating kids, almost all ppl are on GODmode, u cant kill guy with 10 shots of bazooka and he is killing u instantly, u need to just respawn, position on map is doesn't matter. U CANT REPORT CHEAT beacuse he is hidden on player list, even if he is visible, nobody kick him, beacuse rest ppl using cheats too. Cheat can kill all ppl on the server ON YOUR NAME (it looks like u have cheats) ROCKSTAR is making... NOTHING."
gud geim
"honestly its awesome, tho dont get it, wait for gtavi cause this game has shit graphics  an issue is the amount of modders, its just crazy, and theres too much 18+ shit in story mode, online is recommended like 16+ or 13+ or smth theres just violence and ranodom ppl"
It's been out for 10 years and is still good

"This game is for bustas, straight BUSTAS."
"TL;DR: This is the most buggy game I've played in years, possibly ever.  It seems like every other mission requires alt+f4 and a reload to work. The very first mission bugged back to back and I almost didn't bother racing Lamar and requested a refund. I've had the game crash 3 times, so like 1 crash per hour, basically. I picked the ""Cool Cat"" clothes and the cat graphic on the shirt constantly disappears, etc.   For system specs, I have a AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, 3080 TI, Samsung Evo, etc, so it shouldn't be related to hardware as I don't even run the game with maxed out settings.   Biotching aside, I haven't played a GTA since GTA3 on PS2(?) and despite all the BS buggy issues, I found it fun enough to keep booting the game back up. I have a thumbs down because with the game's popularity, time since release, and resources available at Rockstar, I don't think the stability issues are acceptable.  Honestly, I haven't experienced a game this buggy in recent memory, not Cyberpunk at launch, not New World at launch, not <INSERT BAD LAUNCH>, not any EA indie game, nothing; it's actually pretty absurd."
yyes
"Great game, especially FiveM."
Absolute trash that you have to have a dumb ass account to log in and play this dumb shit. Rockstar games can go fuck themselves
Love the game. So much to do and constant hours of fun

"[h1][b]Reality called - I hung up.[/b][/h1]  GTA V is like the Swiss Army knife of the gaming world – it has everything, and I mean literally EVERYTHING, that we could have only dreamed of in GTA: San Andreas: [list]     [*]Extensive Car Customization     [*]Playing as Multiple Characters     [*]Underwater Exploration     [*]Stock Market Trading     [*]Real Estate and Business Management     [*]Leisure Activities     [*]First-Person Mode     [*]Detailed Heist Planning and Execution     [*]Control a Dog     [*]Movie Theater Visits     [*]Hunting     [*]Interactive Internet     [*]Bounty Hunting [/list] and many other things that are not on the list  Basically, you can spend countless hours just customizing your ride and driving around, either obeying traffic laws or, more realistically, seeing how many you can break before the in-game law enforcement starts taking notes  [b]Just don't forget to pause and feed your actual cat[/b]"

"I mainly purchased this game for the Online mode, however a month ago I have decided to relieve the memories of 10 year old me who played the story mode on the good ol' PlayStation 3 back in 2013.  Running triathlons, participating in different kind of races, calling friends for hangouts, participating in different random events, discovering some weird, but hilarious strangers and freaks (props to Nigel and Mrs. Thornill, funniest characters in GTA 5 I've ever witnessed), exploding myself while trying to do the knife flights challenges, checking LifeInvader of each playable character to really get into the story, hunting for deers, laughing my ass off while I brought all 3 playable characters together, made them play golf and watched as AI was absolutely awful at this game.  Story mode in GTA 5 is such a GOAT and I really wish that those DLCs that were planned wayyy back could see the light.   If you are purchasing the game for story mode, absolutely, go for it. If you are purchasing it for online only, eh. There are more fun online games with way better servers, which don't make you spend half of the time in loading screens, out there, buddy."
grand trand arand five
IT VERY GOOD STORY AND I APPROVE
Thousands of hours of gameplay. I love it!
"This game has been the source of many of my most fond gaming memories. The base game comes with a rich story line based in a Los Angeles look-a-like city called Los Santos. In single player mode, you get three very interesting playable protagonists, each complementing the others in their own way. You have Michael, a ""retired"" father figure who is upset at the universe for his own doings. Franklin, the young gangster who is ready to chase some paper, but still has some lessons to learn about the world of organised crime. Lastly, there is Trevor. Trevor is a maniacal, meth-addled criminal who lives in bum-f*ck nowhere north of Los Santos. The three characters all have their own side missions and personal quests that will grow their strengths and sometimes even show their weaknesses. 10/10 Single player. After finishing the single player I jumped into GTA: Online. Since they do regular updates and content additions for free, the GTA Online community is still strong with a large player base. Mod menus do seem to be a dime a dozen, so you do need to be ready at any time to spontaneously combust. If they are too annoying, you can play single player or do a Crew session to keep them out. If you enjoy grinding missions to buy a fancy car or apartment, building an underground criminal empire, or shooting pedestrians, I would give this game a shot."
game is great but if gta 6 doesnt come out next year im never playing again along with other people that dont want to because gta 5 makes money still

"Caros desenvolvedores do GTA V, Gostaria de expressar minha profunda gratidão pelo impacto positivo que o jogo teve em minha vida. Como pai solteiro de uma criança especial, enfrento diariamente desafios únicos. Foi surpreendente perceber como GTA V se tornou uma ferramenta valiosa para fortalecer nosso vínculo. A imersão no mundo do jogo nos proporcionou momentos de descontração e lazer, algo que muitas vezes é difícil de encontrar em nossa rotina. A variedade de atividades no jogo permitiu que eu e meu filho explorássemos juntos, criando memórias preciosas e fortalecendo nossa conexão. Além disso, a narrativa envolvente e os desafios estratégicos do jogo estimularam habilidades cognitivas e de resolução de problemas em meu filho, proporcionando uma experiência educativa de forma divertida. GTA V, para nós, transcendeu o rótulo de apenas um jogo. Tornou-se um meio para enfrentarmos desafios juntos, crescermos como família e encontrarmos alegria em momentos compartilhados. Agradeço sinceramente por criar algo que vai além do entretenimento e se transforma em uma ponte para conexões mais profundas e significativas."
I'm getting too old for this nonsense.

so lets get started here. I played gta for 77 hours. Then I come to a problem. The problem is that when I try to start gta it just doesn't start. I've tried every way possible I think and its not working. I would recommend it but I would not spend 30 dollars on a game I can't play.
wow
"I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."
good fucking game
"Can't play normal online, game any time crashed and broken session. Terrible game!"

"Exploring the vast and dynamic world of GTA 5 is like stepping into a virtual playground where chaos meets creativity. From heart-pounding heists to the scenic drives through Los Santos, this game never fails to deliver an adrenaline rush. Rockstar's attention to detail is impeccable, and the sheer freedom to navigate the cityscape makes every session a unique adventure. Whether you're causing mayhem or chasing the sunset on a stolen car, GTA 5 is a masterpiece that continues to captivate players with its immersive storytelling and boundless possibilities."

"""IN RUSSIA WE CALL SUCH MAN ATM"""
"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is a groundbreaking open-world action-adventure game that continues to captivate players worldwide. Released in 2013, it remains a benchmark in the gaming industry for its expansive and detailed virtual recreation of Los Santos, a fictionalized version of Los Angeles.  One of the standout features of GTA V is its compelling narrative, told through the perspectives of three diverse protagonists: Michael, a retired criminal; Franklin, a street-smart hustler; and Trevor, a volatile and unpredictable character. The intertwining stories create a rich and immersive experience, complemented by exceptional voice acting and character development.  The game's vast open-world environment is a playground for mayhem and exploration. The attention to detail in the cityscape, from towering skyscrapers to gritty alleyways, is truly remarkable. The sheer variety of activities, missions, and side quests ensures that players always have something engaging to do, whether it's high-stakes heists, adrenaline-pumping car chases, or more leisurely pursuits like golf and tennis.  GTA V excels in its ability to seamlessly blend action, humor, and social commentary. The satirical take on modern society, celebrity culture, and the pursuit of the American Dream adds depth to the narrative. The radio stations and in-game media provide a humorous and insightful look at the world, making the game not just entertaining but also thought-provoking.  The game's multiplayer component, Grand Theft Auto Online, extends the experience beyond the single-player campaign. With its constantly evolving content, including heists, races, and a variety of customizable options, GTA Online has maintained a dedicated player base, fostering a dynamic online community.  However, it's worth noting that the game has faced criticism for its mature content, including violence and explicit language. This may not be suitable for all audiences, and potential players should be aware of the game's content before diving in.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains a monumental achievement in the gaming industry. Its combination of a compelling story, stunning open-world design, and diverse gameplay options make it a must-play for fans of the genre. While the mature content may not be suitable for everyone, those who appreciate a gripping narrative and a vast, immersive virtual world will find GTA V to be an unforgettable gaming experience."
Honestly.... with all the shit going on in my life i need an outlet for my anger and sexual frustration. I play this to help me cope with all of that and i still want to commit a felony! 10/10 :)
Harmonious and orderly society Friendly coexistence between citizens and cops
"Except the fact that starting and finishing a heist is pretty difficult because you need all 4 players to participate and succeed, its a very cool and realistic game with a hight fun factor enjoying driving vehicles..."
"Grand Theft Auto V by Rockstar Games presents a captivating exploration of cultural narratives set within the diverse and intricate backdrop of the fictional city of Los Santos. The game's trio of protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor - offer a multifaceted perspective on life in a Western urban setting, resonating with the experiences of adapting to new cultural environments.

Moreover, GTA Online extends this experience, facilitating multicultural interactions akin to those encountered in diverse societies. This game is more than just entertainment; it's a bridge between cultures, a tool for understanding, and a canvas for exploring the complexities of different societies. Grand Theft Auto V is an essential experience for anyone intrigued by the rich tapestry of cultural landscapes and the dynamics of urban life."

"High Quality game in terms of graphics, story, gameplay- sometimes a little bit too much driving from A to B to enlarge missions."
buzz
its GTA V
a bit outdated ran with hackers AI is stupid cars spawn out of no where but to be perfectly honest with you its a good game a game to come home to unwind mod with friends have car meets i feel like people lost track of what this game was supposed to be because of all the shark cards and hackers rip gta v 7/10
"I do not know what the product is. I did not play this game for a while, then I started playing it again after I spent 3 weeks in a coma, and 3 months in the hospital."
michael is sooooooooooo fine amanda is so ungrateful 1000/10 stars
"Good and all, etc"
Hackers ruins online

I LOVE THIS GAME
SUCKS
"For the people asking (is it worth to get GTA 5 in 2024 right now?). I think it is, if you want to play this game for online mode I will just tell you it's ok because online mode is just earning money not more than that and when I say earning money like from doing heists,missions and from nightclub one of the best things to earn money from. When you earn money enough to buy your dream car you won't focus on another thing like you will just think this game is over. Only if you wan't to play for fun with your friends then this is something else. If you want that game for story mode then gg. I didn't try to play story mode but I think online is much better like the story is meh, that's  my opinion. ( you can watch youtube videos to earn money faster no need to waste so much time on this game anymore)"
still a great game in 2024
hhaaa
great online mode.........
it is a fun game very
its pretty cheeky
got doxxed
where do i get activation code from

"There is no reason to play this game (referring to the online). the ""story"" is recycled from the campaign and better older games. gaining money is pointless because of hacks, the vehicle sandbox can be better replicated in other games and has little to no staying power in terms of fun, payday did better heists, fortnight does better racing and literally every game on earth with a functional crouch button beats this in stealth, any game with a functional firearm and crossplay beats its shooting mechanics and warframe has it beat when it comes the the sheer length of the grind and the rewards you get from it.   shit game i regret spending hundreds of hours wasting away on a pointless shitty grind  p.s. i would rather stomp a puppy to death than drive the Dune loader for another second"

GTA Online is fine at the beginning but recently the new content getting boring and more bored. I know its not a DLC but the content really too short and no sense. Sometimes come with bunch of bug.. BTW still a lot of cheater bomb you here and there....
"GTA 5 Online is probably the most scummiest fucking thing ever, ignore my high playtime because that was before i realized that this game was made to take your money and nothing else. Almost every single person i came across had a mod menu and Rockstar isn't doing anything about it. Normally video games are meant to be a way to have fun and chill out, except this game is nothing but a chore. Grinding is so fucking boring and i know that it's supposed to be like that since you're doing the same missions over and over again but my god are some of the missions just fucking bullshit, like why can't i carry 3 crates at once? Why do the enemies have perfect aim? Why do some enemies not die from a headshot but some of them do? Why did some missions get nerfed? And why the FUCK is there a cooldown after every single fucking thing i do? Whether it be missions,phone or the interaction menu there is always a cooldown. The answers to these questions is one thing and one thing only, money (Shark Cards) Rockstar is doing everything in their power to make you spend money on this game and not giving a shit about any other game (RDR 2 because they haven't made a game since 2018 and no the shitty mobile port doesn't count) Rockstar is probably one of if not the most scummiest video game company i have ever seen."
this game is good if your a ten year old at game stop trying to get or you not under age and playing its fun for all so yes i have bean playing for 256 hours and its good from the mods to the normal game
"Story mode good, online is a waste of time imo."

GTA 5 Online is fun to play with friends. Exciting and fun things to do
shoe house is the best thing ever
The best game of all time
criminal starter pack not getting it
Running from the police
[b] Gameplay breakdown: [/b] 10% shooting 20% heists 40% driving [u] 130% loading & initializing [/u]
"this is a fun game for its purpose of story mode and multiplayer mode, excited for gta 6"
No.
"Trevor carried story mode, no cap."
Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
Very fun worth the money
Because it does not modify the game to suit the Arab community and delete pornographic clips
Mods make offline fun
this game is very fun you could do whatever the fuck u wnana doo
Bad game
"Many good memories on XBOX, none on PC. If you like children with mods and hacks to abuse you in the ONLINE section of the game then go ahead and play. You will be trolled, banned, kicked, and abused.  ROCKSTAR Support is a joke, don't bother...  If you like Story mode, its a 10/10 game, we all know that.. but as far as its ONLINE Play goes. Do not bother."
good fun good
best with mods
god of games
you can't talk to other people
since nobody gonna see this : big gyat men
too many hackers and modders in almost every public lobby. Ruin the fun of the game. Rockstar is sleeping on this smhhh
So rude
"I want to love this game, i really do.  Dont get me wrong, its a great game, high quality story line.  The AMOUNT of glitches, exploits, cheaters, and overall average iq of players being about 3 or so, make this game a fucking nightmare in online.  Find some friendly players, and play in invite only matches, unless you want to spawn into a warzone where a lot of the time the enemy you face is literally invincible because there is no anticheat.  I would give this a thumbs up, if not, for the sheer volume of glitches and braindead, skill less players that use mk2's, the new stealth vtol, and straight up fucking mods and hacks."
hgdf
please play 18+ player only
yum
naice
pure havoc
"As much as I love the GTA world, been a fan since the very 1st game, but I'll never be able to play and complete every aspect of the game with all the different ways the story can go or get into the online world because of the toxic nature people have in gaming in general. I do think this is a legendary game to experience. Enjoy it for the next 2 years since GTA 6 was announced and once that drops it'll be all GTA 6 for the next decade."
I Like Making Coke And Committing War Crimes. :D
Its fun! As long as your willing to grind and you buy the DLC to help kick you off its a good time!
"Amazing game, especially with mods from gta5-mods.com"
its is fun
amazing game play till gta 6 is out

"Played only on single player. This game hits the spot if you want to race around a city and be an outlaw. The story is not that interesting to me and the characters are underwhelming, although you may find them crudely entertaining at times. You will unfortunately be stuck very often listening to unlikable characters go on and on when you just want to try to outrun cops, jump motorcycles off of cliffs, fly planes or fight gangsters. The gameplay in the missions is very fun, though. You may want to get a controller that has little joysticks on it, like a generic xbox-style controller because you'll want to precisely control your speed and angle of movement, but you can get by with using a keyboard and mouse. You will have to deal with the Rockstar launcher but it is doable.  Overall it's a fun game and I recommend it."
Worth for money
I use the opressor to annoy people I also have a realy small pp

"Grand Cleft Awooga the Fifth Jr. is a good game. Michael is a washed up bank robber with repressed memories and that classic boomer ""I hate my wife!"" mentality that I enjoy playing as.

"Utter garbage.  Played 10 minutes of the Story Mode and had to stop. Couldn't listen to another word of the developers attempt to have the main character sound cool by butchering every word of the English language that came out of it's mouth.  Played the online game...attempted to resupply the MC bar and found the MC bar supply delivery van doors to be bugged. Undriveable, somehow manages to flip on its head from a standing potion. Not a great start but there is a simple fix for that one. Then attempted a MC contract mission... drove to site, killed everyone, destroyed enemy choppers, stole some ugly looking flying motorcycle, delivered it to some clown who wants it but found that no matter which button I pressed the Spongebob cargo chopper would not release the cargo. I could write a couple more paragraphs from what I have seen in the short time I have played this console garbage. One will do.   Rockstar Games? Pfffffft. More like a high school cover band."
Is so hard to be a cop

GTA yah
great game 9/10
fun too play
hello jacob
i love how alot of the online heists are unplayable not because of the overwhelming amount of hackers and modders flooding the lobbies but the actual game breaking bugs that they just refuse to fix for some fucking reason whats funny is that the only reason there isnt as big of a modding problem on console isnt because rockstar cares more about it on there its just that consoles are hard to jailbreak jesus i hope 6 isnt this bad if they do make a new online
this game lame asf dont buy it eat my cock
best fgame ever
fire but hella modders
fuck yeah
I think I've bought this game like 4 times because of switching platforms and other reasons but I'd buy it again if i had to. One of my all time favorite game series.

"Grand Theft Auto V is like a virtual vacation where I get to indulge my inner criminal mastermind without any real-life consequences (thankfully!). I've hijacked more virtual cars than a Hollywood stunt driver, and my character's criminal empire is growing faster than my houseplants (and that's saying something). The graphics are so stunning that I sometimes forget it's a game and start looking for cheat codes to bring those graphics into my real life. Rockstar, you've turned my living room into a digital crime playground, and I'm loving every pixelated moment of it!"

"NICE GAME , I'M PLAYING GTA ROLEPLAY AND VERY HAPPY"
BEST GAME !!!EVER!!!
like come on its gta like download it
Пятую часть я долго не мног пройти так как особого желания небуло но что то мнея повело на то чтобы пройти сюжетку и увидеть какова история 3-ох главных героев. Игра по достежениям может быть не возможной так как в GTA Online мировые рекорды побили читеры от 3 - 10 секунд в гонках и других мисиях. Отчасти себя скажу... пройти сюжетку стоит хотябы 5 милионов доллоров в онлайне. Как то сравнить её с другим частями Grand Theft Auto не могу так как они довольно сильно отлечются.
"I have no problems with this game's story mode, in fact it was a great experience and I really liked the missions that this game offers. However, this is not the case for this game's online mode, Rockstar should improve their anti-cheat system because it is really ineffective. Everytime I log in and play GTA online, I either got killed immediately by some hackers or I got teleported everytime to a random place by them. The online mode in this game has reached the point where it is unplayable when it comes to public sessions. Please rockstar, improve your anti-cheat system because if this continues, then many people will lose interest in this game and you (rockstar) could lose a lot of profit (I mean this game had been published since 2013 so  I don't think that you guys care)."
Not able to start the game when the associated Rockstar social club account is lost. Rockstar support does not provide any help. What a fantastic experience :)
You know this game.

I played this on so many platforms. It's just great and in my opinion the best GTA. I love the California vibes and the grim dark satire of it.

"I love how i can do anything anywhere, and anytime! I love the game and would recommend this to all people starting out with a new console. Overall, its a beautiful game and I like it, and i think you would too!!!"
"this is a great game. it does take a while to download tho. but the 2 and a half hour download time was worth it cause this is an amazing game. lots of things to do.punch a person in the face,kill someone etc.."
Dylan Plz buy it
game sucks
Online mode is basically full of cheaters.
"This was a great game for its time. The physics, vehicles, story, and gameplay make for a very fun game, but my god does this game have some serious issues with its online mode. Majority of heists and gameplay used towards getting money are convoluted and boring. The pricing for vehicles are stupidly inconsistent, and imo some should just not be in the game to begin with. Every lobby is ridden with modders or hackers either blowing you to smithereens every time you respawn or exceedingly raising your rank and giving random amounts of money.    My hope for GTA 6's online is that it centers more into the roleplaying aspect of the game. Make the world feel grounded, have different kinds of roles and ways of making decent money. Have illegal roles like hitman, gangster,drug dealer, bankrobber. mobster, but also have like more honest money making roles like hunting, businessman, or mechanic, etc, to make the world feel more opportunistic. But above all, FIX YOUR ISSUE WITH HACKERS."
Story mode is amazing but online is pretty ass
"""Why did I move here? Guess it was the weather."""
GTA V is a little overrated. But its hella awesome

BEST GAME
[h1] Grand Theft Auto V [/h1] It's ok.
It's mindless fun!
Do not buy from Rockstar. Game will not launch and says it needs to be activated (I have played GTA V for years on this original copy purchased right here on Steam).  I contacted Rockstar and they said to buy another copy and activate on a different account.  I contacted Steam and they said nope can't help Contact Rockstar (see above)
DGF
gta has the awesome key to use ur fav cars and rob banks and tons of shit i like the most
good game play with family
"The best way that I can describe the GTA 5 experience is simply freedom. The game simply has no boundaries. You want 1v1 people go for it, car meets, heist, drug operations, flying, stealth, story mode, chaos; it does not matter. This game has dominated for over a decade now and there is a reason for that. The story is excellent, the online while it can be annoying at times is very well done. There are games that I would consider masterpieces; like God of War and Elden Ring, while GTA 5 may not be a masterpiece in the same sense as those two mentioned it is simply timeless. 10/10 would recommend."

GTA IV Is superior.
"Main-Story was great and definitely fun to play through, the gameplay mechanics of GTA haven't aged at all and are still refreshing if you boot it up after a couple of months/years, they'll probably still be fun in the next ages, just the multiple 'main' characters were something I had to get used to at first but didn't mind after the first couple of hours of gameplay. (9.2/10)  The multiplayer has a bunch of flaws though, which just have gotten worse over time. I haven't played in years but I remember loading into an online lobby usually took, when you were lucky 10-15 minutes without any errors but the constant money farming and the unbalanced vehicles is basically what killed the fun for me, it's like either pay for microtransactions or farm for multiple tens or hundreds of hours some GTA dollars to buy some (mostly) useless addon to your base, vehicle etc, for the majority just to have it easier to kill other online players, which is for the most part completly irrelevant. The heists were great fun, aswell as the custom gamemodes and races, with friends there was endless amounts of content and hours you could put into it, but for the heists you also had to do a bunch of farming before being able to do all of them. (8/10)"

"Let me preface this that my review is mostly towards GTA online. GTA V single player is a well made game and probably worth the price despite it being 10 years old and having received zero updates or improvements.   GTA Online is still a buggy mess after a decade. I think the coding that made this game in 2013 was a shaky foundation at best, and complete spaghetti code so convoluted nothing fundamental can be improved or fixed at worst. It has been 10 years and I still get loading screens as if I'm on Xbox 360 with a HDD. It's 2024 and more times than I can count I enter a building and am greeted with loading screens for 3+ minutes before I give up and alt F4. The inventory/interaction menu is unbelievably unintuitive and frustrating to use. You have to go through 10 different options fumbling around to heal yourself. The phone call system is still obnoxious as ever. Constantly berated with calls, emails, texts, and notifications from characters begging me to do or buy something. WHERE IS THE DO NOT DISTURB FUNCTION. My mechanic takes about 30 seconds to pickup his phone and half the time can't get my car to me. This was an issue in 2013... Matchmaking is a joke. If you load into a job you will rarely get to play a full match. You have to start the match in a public lobby to actually be able to invite anyone. The awful pay for the jobs contributes to the problem as why would anyone want to play this race for $5k when there are better ways to make money. The money you earned is directly tied to how long you played so it’s better to just afk the mission than play. Original heists still require 4 people and force end the mission if someone leaves. I cannot tell you how many times I've had an error loading into GTA Online and get sent back to Storymode. WHY CAN’T YOU REQUEUE ME?   Rockstar loathes its player base. Zero communication ever. Programming cars to swerve into while driving. Nerf payouts of everything. Force players to glitch desired outfits like police uniforms and then blacklist and remove them. We can buy police cars now, but not uniforms?? I cannot believe it took a fucking decade to add police cars you can keep. Players have been asking for cops and crooks dlc for years and get only some half baked police cars. They even made the police suv a console exclusive. Arbitrary limits to the number of CEOs in an online session (you need to be one to do any mission). Add blatantly overpowered vehicles for players to grief you. Encourages players to grief you by making you a target on the map when selling stuff (you can do sell missions in solo lobbies now, only took 5 years to add but still). You have to install Rockstar launcher to play. Horribly unoptimized for online. Tanks your FPS going online from singleplayer. Poor vehicle diversity, max like 5 different car spawns. Sell missions forcing you to use 4 of the slowest vehicles in existence and drive across the map back. Die on a mission and need to retry? Any snacks and armor you used will not be reset so back out and restock or good luck. Playing with some people and you exit the lobby? Good luck finding them you are put into a different lobby. Not fun, just bad game design.   The economy is still inflated beyond belief. $5 million dollars for a police car??? $2 million for a mustang? $400k for a rifle? They have made strides in improving money making capabilities with solo heists and improved business payouts, but you have to be experienced and willing to grind. You need millions of dollars in properties to be able to make any significant money, which is why they have a starter pack. You practically need this to play if you are new. Shark cards give you a pitiful amount of money for how much you spend. (please don't give rockstar money, buy a $100 billion dollar account from modders for like 5 dollars). This game has somehow been kept alive and milked for a decade from casual players and whales giving in to micro transactions.   You think CSGO or Rust has a cheater problem? You wouldn't fucking believe the number of cheaters on PC. It's basically in the TOS that Rockstar doesn't care if you use a mod menu. They even reward them because they don't ever ban them, but will ban you if you do a money glitch. God mode glitches never get patched or banned.  There is zero punishment for cheating. Every other person is cheating. Maybe not overtly spawning spaceships and putting you in a death loop, but casually playing in God mode grinding. Abysmal security for online where modders can get everyone's IP. You played a heist and the money was never paid? Support will tell you to go fuck yourself. There isn't even an option for missing money on support, they couldn't care less.  They treat PC like last gen consoles by locking PC out of content on new gen consoles. They REMOVED 200 VEHICLES for purchase and made them available on a subscription service gta+. Animals have been added into online... for consoles only. PC has the best hardware and doesn't get the animals? Something that should've been in the game to begin with.   They just keep adding DLC with more bloat. They add so many vehicles that nobody ever uses and just keep adding more and more. The missions and heists they do add are pretty good. Although a lot of them require multiple people to play.    If Rockstar had any competition we would have had GTA VI years ago and a much better game. Instead, we get this shit show. Cautiously optimistic for GTA VI. Rockstar is a shell of its former self. The heads of the studio that made Rockstar great have left the company."
"Third party launcher, AND required account (which the game is forever bound too). Regret actually buying it on Steam, because WTF was the point?  My fault I guess, but I do not know whatever email I used to to activate this in their shitty launcher (a SECOND time, since I ALREADY PAID FOR IT THROUGH STEAM). Their support is... not support, just a website, and the number they have just says to go to the website.  I am sure it is a great game (I had fun when I played it ON MY STEAM AAAAND ROCKSTAR ACCOUNT), but be sure you remember you credentials... unlike stupid me... which actually is completely ridiculous."
this game makes me hard i really recommend
got called the n word. pretty cool would recommend
heel store is W
I absolutely love this game! I have played for thousands of hours on all platforms in total. A must-have for every gamer.
i like to run people over
Greatest game of all time!
the lester mision
"Let me start by saying that I have never cared for the GTA style games (GTA, RDR, Saints Row etc.) but a friend gifted me this because i needed a change of pace to play with friends. I don't love the game by any means, and while I'm still not a fan (these just aren't my preferred games), I can see all the hype. The game is very well made and even after being more than 10 years old, still gets regular updates. I still havent been made a fan, but i do rather enjoy playing and just messing around with friends. 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND ONLINE PUBS THOUGH. It's private friend sessions and story mode for me. If you play online (outside a modded or 5M server) prepare to hate every moment of it."
good fun broh
DO NOT OPEN THE GAME WITH YOUR PARENTS IN THE ROOM I BEG YOU PLAY THIS ALONE PLEASE MY BACK IS RED
THIS GAME IS LOWKEY SICK AS HECK
"I love the GTA series and V for the PC has been really awesome. Runs smooth and fast. I have a 2060 GeForce RTX and It looks so vibrant. Its perfect if you want to play online, the downside you tend to run into hackers im hoping in the future GTA VI online lobbies they have something that wont let that happen. Also on the online I usually run around by myself but its way easier to make money these days so the content is always there. All in all I highly Recommend it to anyone also if you like to add me I can help you, just ask me in a DM."

Good game frfr
"There is a ton of stuff to be done on the online, but unfortunately it is plagued with cheaters ruining the fun for others, you can join a solo lobby and grind but it will get old after 100 hours, give or take."
Fun when able to play online in private sessions.
"Story Mode is just as exciting and good as you'd expect.  Online is boring, just constant requests to join heists from players and a constant barrage of notifications for features no one uses anymore."

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
ITS GOOD
The Story Is SOOOOOOOOOOO fun It has great characters are so cool
"GTA Online - Cheater edition. Want cheaters? play GTA Online. I was just playing around with a new vehicle I got, some one drives to me, shoots me with explosive gun, teleports to me. Kills me again, teleports me to them. Same thing. I change lobbies, another cheater instantly spawns me and entire lobby. Guns us all down. I try to do a mission, lose all my weapons. I spawn in a public lobby from mission, instantly get crashed by infinite things spawning on me. GTA online. If GTA VI is like this, might as well not play it. Only good thing in this game is singleplayer and private lobbies. Sad. Played 15 lobbies, 15+ griefing cheaters."
its great but the only downside is if a modder gives you levels you get kicked even if you did'nt ask for them
very very good

"How can you not like this? It's absolutely amazing in storytelling, but online has uhh a few ""Modding"" problems everybody wishes was fixed, but since it doesn't intefere with sharkcard purchases the greedy company we all love known as rockstar doens't care about the problem."
Very Fun game. I reccomend this to all players. Except if you dont understand the rules when doing missions.

"This is one huge rip off of an online game.  Virtually impossible to play without modders crashing your game in some way.  It happens 100% of the time I play.   This game has become dangerous to play because it opens up your computer to hackers.    Don't bother spending your money here.  Rockstar refuses to fix the issue, don't give them your money"
I HATE ROCKSTAR THESE MOTHERFUCXKER DID NT HELPL; I FUCKING REFUNDED THERR GAME JUST SO I COULD THE GET MY GAME BACKJ FUCK U ROCKSTAR

its so goooooooooooood
"[h2] [i] ""You wake up one day and your legs- they just give, and you just can't run anymore..."" [/i][/h2]  Pretty easy to see why it's one of the top games ever. Shame it never got a proper campaign expansion due to Online being a Depository-sized piggy bank. You come in for the guns, action, clever dialogue and whacky antics and leave thinking about integrity, betrayal, friendship and what's truly valuable to one's heart.  I wouldn't say it's my favorite open world of all-time, cuz it ain't. But I admire it for what it was, and it excelled in just about every way aside from the occasional instance of clumsy pacing or boring mission objectives.  Obvious recommend for anyone who likes modern action, drama and a lotta swearing."
i sharted
this game is the best f**king game EVER!!! THANK YOU ROCKSTAR

This game helped me realize that V is a Roman numeral for the number 5. I was confused until they showed that beginning scene where they called each other a n1gg@.
"Other than the little shits that ruin the open online session experience by chasing you around on Oppressors or abuse mods they paid for, this game is actually one of the best games to have ever come out. If you're into robbing, getting money, guns, racing, anything remotely car related, or getting railed by modders, this game is 100% for you. The story is also really good."
This game made my wife have an affair with the neighbor...he fucked me too. Turns out we're swingers 10/10 would recommend.

If you can get over the fact that every single online lobby has a modder or 10 in it then its great. Otherwise make your own closed friend session and have fun. Whenever you go into public lobbies and try to do any PVP the other guy just turns on God Mode and Explosive Bullets and starts one tapping you until you leave. Good game though...
ITS VAREY GOOD
Nuked by an Oppressor Abuser and then watched them get nuked by a hydra until they quit. 10/10

"This game is amazing. I genuinely love it, the campaign is amazing and I think this was my favorite game of 2023, I reccomend it any time. Im  touching my weiner to a video about a stepsister while I write this, makes reviewing this even better."
"Obnoxious launcher, garbage publisher abandoned the single player years ago and only focuses on milking smooth brains with shark cards."
One Of The Best Games I’ve Played That Still Holds Up Today.

"GTA V is the ultimate chaos simulator. Traffic rules? Optional. Pedestrian dodging skills? A+. Storyline? Explosive, literally. I'd give it a ""Kidnapped by Aliens"" twist if I could.  But let's get serious – where's GTA VI, Rockstar? I've got plans to stay alive for that. Until then, I'll be in Los Santos, causing virtual mayhem and dodging more bullets than in a Michael Bay film."
its gta is away good
Fun gameplay and interesting story!
love this game

"Delightfully addictive and hard to put down. Grand Theft Auto V offers a fantastic sandbox world to play in, with a well flowing story and expansive online mode. In regards to solo play, GTAV gives a classic story of criminal success and lets you feel like a truly powerful while letting you tap into your inner sociopath. The three main characters are by no means good people, trying to live their lives while trying to separate themselves from their pasts. Despite this, their actions would soon come back to haunt them, no matter who you play. It's by no means a masterclass in story writing, but its hashed together well enough and more than enough moments of fulfilling a power fantasy that you won't pay it much mind. Furthermore the world of Los Santos itself does what GTA as a series has always done well: Creating a snapshot parody of American culture at the time. While always crude and satirical, coming from 2013 it does have some dated aspects compared to the current year, but the game is rated M for a reason.  As for the online mode, it further enhances the power fantasy by letting you create your own self insert, meeting all the notable characters of the main story, and letting you carve your own path to criminal underworld infamy while amounting tremendous amounts of cash along the way. I will admit, I most often play in private lobbies as an introverted person, and having tried online more seriously in the past few months, it's really difficult to get a start in the world without doing a notable amount of research into what's worth prioritizing (start with the drug wars series in Sandy Shores, by the way). Additionally, and while I later learned the reason for it, it's obnoxious that after every mission I do with friends we're always sorted back into individual private lobbies or worse put into public ones. These issues aside, I delighted in roleplaying with friends online and forming our own criminal empires while snatching up businesses and running missions.  All in all, GTA V is still worth your time over a decade after its original inception."

"good with friends or in private servers, otherwise too many greffers and hackers"

"One of the best games of all time for sure, I mean being able to play game where you can shoot people, go in strip club, and many other different illegal shit in 21st century is perfect, 10/10"
"haven't finished the game yet, but the very start of the game felt a little slow to me for some reason. probably just me but i pushed through that and its a very fun game so far"
VERY interesting.
G.O.A.T.
The storymode is amazing. But this is the worst online game i have ever played. This online is just a piece of garbage cash grab.
very interesting and detailed game
this is the best game to play

"Cool Game in general until you play online, there are more modders than normal players in this game, and Rockstar will never ban them, even though they update online every month"
"HACKERS HACKERS HACKERS... thats what you get from ROCKSTAR all mf day, still fun at times i mean when isnt GTA fun at times but man a hacker just ruins even the best of games while Developers just sit on their FAT A**es and do nothing but still try to sell in game stuff but a hacker will give me 1 mil all day for free. base game is fun always but online idk. can be fun but hackers always ruin it for me. I cant believe people actually brag about being hackers in this game and in general lol especially with the majority have been registered SO's lol that might make em die off XD  Singleplayer- Recommended  Online- Not recommended due to hackers/ no hackers can be fun at times but not like gta4"

"GTA V is a masterpiece that effortlessly blends stunning visuals, an engrossing storyline, and a vast open world. My friends and I have spent countless hours laughing, strategizing, and indulging in pure chaos. Whether you're a fan of action-packed missions, immersive storytelling, or simply exploring a meticulously crafted virtual playground, GTA V has it all. Buckle up, and get ready to be swept away into the wild streets of Los Santos – it's a ride you won't soon forget."
overall game is excellent but i am so much excited for gta6 pc  version

okk

nioce
best graphics i have ever experienced. Magnificent open-world and addictingly fun online servers
the experience
lots and lots of cheater no equilibrium
"After years of hearing the hype, I finally caved and jumped into the chaotic world of GTA 5 on PC, and let me tell you, it was about time! This game isn't just a game; it's a wild, uncontrollable rollercoaster of absurdity, especially thanks to one Mr. Trevor Philips.  Trevor, the human embodiment of a ""no filter"" policy, is like that one friend who always gets you into trouble, but you can't help but hang around because they're just so entertaining. His unpredictable antics had me in stitches, whether he was rampaging through the streets in his underwear or waxing poetic about life's injustices while piloting a stolen helicopter.  The graphics still hold and are crisp and detailed, making misadventures through Los Santos a visually stunning experience. And on PC, the modding community turns this already insane game into a surreal playground where anything can happen. Want to see Trevor riding a flying bike dressed as a pikachu? There's probably a mod for that.  The storyline is gripping, but let's be real – it's Trevor's show. The missions involving him often left me in a moral grey area, but always with a smirk on my face. His dark humor, combined with the game's satirical take on modern society, makes for an unforgettable experience.  GTA 5 on PC is a masterpiece of madness, and Trevor is the cherry on top of this chaotic sundae. If you, like me, are late to the party, don't worry – the party doesn't start until Trevor shows up anyway. 10/10!"

"Came for the online game, stayed for story mode, can't wait for GTA6."
"NICE GAME , GOOD GRAPHICS"

i loved the graphics i just got dissapointed because i thought theres mod in solo mode
spent the last 4-5 hours and $15 trying migrate my ps5 account only to find out you cant dont buy til R* makes you restart in 2025
fun as fuck
"This game has it's ups and downs as every game does, but if you're looking for something to just kick back and play this is your game. There's numerous amounts of things to do, customize cars, hangout with friends, or go on a rampage. Its just overall an enjoyable game so I'd definitely give it a try"
10 years and its still good
"Rockstar are incapable of managing an online atmosphere despite making billions from it. Game is rampant with hackers/modders that will boot you from a game/session due to their fragility.  Despite billions of dollars being pumped into a company, being completely incapable of having a playable online space is a an embarrassing joke.  The story is alright, but the complete lack of effort managing online unless it involves a cashgrab makes Rockstar a garbage company."
It's gta you know if it's good
ppp in a cupp
I like to get drunk and pay prostitutes to touch my wiener
I loved the story mode but the online portion is so immersive. I recommend getting the game just for the online experience.
alway crashing
THIS GAME IS VERY NICE BECAUSE IT IS BASED ON REALISTIC GRAPHICS AND DIFFERENT CARS AND ALSO MAINLY ONLINE EDITION IS VERY FUN AND WITH GOOD MISSIONS
banned for no reason without using cheat 😭
Gave me the xbox 360 version and cant play dont buy here
"online mode is fun but i like the story mode also, cayo perico heist"
Great even without mods
UNREALISTIC PROSTITUTES
"after a decade of this game being out, i finally have a pc that can run this"
i love going to the shoe store
gret
gta 6 next year whooo
loading simulator
This game is fun and the story and online are impeccable.
I changed my email on steam and Rock Star wouldn't help me recover account even after I gave them all requested info. Out $59.00. :(
Had to finish it before gta6 will get released after I played years ago 3 quater of the story.  On of rockstars alltime highlights. 9.5/10
"I know this game came out in 2013, but still the whole story is just the best start to a story game you can get. I would recommend pc gamers to get this, its one of the must haves for pc gaming. The next gen consoles are also great for this game, I just recommend getting this game in general."
game so good my dad came back with the milk
this game is very fun
"immersive and expansive ""irl"" playground. Everything is focussed on making money though and if Shark Cards weren't a thing, I'm sure the game woul dbe a much more community oriented, FAIR challenge. On some gang war shit."
"i am just a dumb guy with a day job. it makes me agree to some putrid terms of service and log into a web site every time i care to play this game i paid for. and if i forget my password i can click the web site button then check my email but no link has arrived. obviously it is my fault, i'm sure i forgot how i signed up for my rockstar games web site account. heck with it i will find something else to do"
BIG CAR VROOM BIG BIG GUN BOOM
"So I won't lie, if you wanna have fun in gta online in 2024 and are starting FRESH, get a modded account like I did in 2023. Worth every penny. Game is fun just a lot of modders on pc. Griefing is an issue but you can just join another session or grief back when you have unlimited cash."
pretty cool game
it is gooowd
edde56fr56f 6fv66gty6yugu yhyhhbigbiihy cvvhvb jbjbj hihihjh hhiihijjo9jojojhfpf0pg

Not good in 2023 unless you're a nerd who knows how to do the extremely complicated process of modding it. Everything looks and feels outdated.
are you not entertained?
Best game in the world

"BLOWN UP SELLING MONEY: CHECK, BLOWN UP SELLING WEAPONS: CHECK, BLOWN UP SELLING OR DOING ANYTHING:CHECK!"
GOOOOOOD
cars go vroom
worst game physics and online mode
eeeeeeeeeee
A few years ago I bought a desktop that meet the minimum requirements of the game but the game was basically unplayable. I waited for a few years and now I have a computer that could comfortably play the game but I am locked out of single player because I forgot the email i used to play the game for an hour 3 years ago. This game sucks i'm going to unadd this game and just pirate it if it's the only way I'm allowed to play the game.
Just a classic.
xxss
this game bore
very nice strip club the girls had very nice tits even better then barbara with big titties
it is cool fr fr ong no cap
I PLAY FIVEM
Worst in the series
"Lol, who the f wouldn't recommend this game?? It's GTA, FAM!"
"I'm very late to the party. The game is old and everybody has played it or at least I'd assume they did. I picked the game up for $10 on a sale and decided to play it through since I never got around to it. Before I began the hype around GTA 6 was a-blaze on the internet and I didn't understand all these people saying that they want to play it right now. It's a game, you can wait, it's going to be just fine and nothing that will change your life.  But about GTA 5, when I started I quickly settled into it. I didn't care about online or most of the side-side-content. I did do some side-quests because they were all interesting enough and distinct enough that going through them was enjoyable. And the story even for side-quests was interesting. I have not skipped a single cut scene because I was in awe of the motion capture. It's not that it looks real life or anything, but the model for it is so well done you feel these people moving, talking and thinking. You easily bond with basically anybody because their face expressions are believable. And besides, most of the best parts of this game happen in cars where you're just driving down some highway listening to your station and people are talking. Sometimes I'd slow down just to make sure that I got to listen to everything that they had to say because the dialog is quick, snappy, people don't wait for others to finish this monologue - mostly - to start talking. And the stuff they talk about is always something you can somewhat connect to. Well not always about being a murderer, but for example you can somewhat feel how Micheal is feeling even though he is a murderer that faced no consequences and is living in a mansion doing nothing. Each of the characters are distinct and interesting, and everyone is placed in a spot where you see that they don't want to go back doing what they were doing but at the same time you see that continuing doing what they currently pursue is destroying their relationship with others. Not Trevor really, but that's beside the point.  The place where the game has it's thing down is driving, each car is different and you quickly learn which ones to pick on the street. Because of the fact that driving is so interesting and feels so complex it feels okay to be placed in those situations where you have to drive from point A to point B. At first. In the last quarter of this game driving becomes really tedious. But it does not affect the game too much to become a big problem, and the radio stations are great so you can just enjoy the music. But to be honest it sometimes also depends. When you have the vibe, enabling the first person perspective and obeying all the traffic laws while driving is really relaxing. But doing it for too long can expose the limitation in the AI of the characters that are just running/driving around the city.  The story is flesh out really well. Everybody gets their introduction and ending - maybe expect Stretch, this character is a part in the ending but you only play one mission with him. Everything comes around in a nice circle where every character is introduced, they play their part and most likely they're dead at the end. Killing off people is paced well and people that you are rooting for to be killed are written in a way to make you hate them. That way once you finally get them it feels right but at the same time it feels like these people are over the top but maybe not really once you start to unpeel the layers that make up these characters - Devin and Steve Haines. But not to make it out to be something better than it really is, the story is just good. It is strong and the characters are likeable but not something where you are DEEPLY invested in them. It is just there to serve it's purpose and to cover the fact that the game is mostly about shooting other people.  The game is long, interesting, simple and fun. Now I know why people want to play GTA 6 already. Because it's most likely going to be really fun."

pop the opps
VERY WORTH IT!
driving and music is the best combo in this game

"Grand Theft Auto V is that sandbox open world experience that keeps you busy for 200+ hours in single player or 500 hours or more in multiplayer.    In single player mode you'll find a long and beautiful campaign with over 70 main missions and 3 endings,that alone is going to take over 30 hours if you rush it but i advise to enjoy and explore everything because it's worth.  The strangers and freaks,the side missions and side activities represent a huge chunk of the game ,it's amazing how much details and work they put into these.  There is also the multiplayer,which received along the years manny content updates. I dare say there's more content in GTA Online and if you're afraid of cheaters you can create a session only for you and play it alone without some features but enough to finish almost everything by yourself.  Pros:  -Amazing story with great voice acting,huge amount of content -Multiplayer receive content updates even after 9 years  Cons:  -sometimes in multiplayer it's best to create a only friend invite session to avoid cheaters   My review score:  Story   - 10  Gameplay- 9 Graphics- 8 Music   -  9   Overall - 9"
nice game for ceto king
"it wont let me sign  back in,iv made multiple accounts and emails and nothing works ,very irritating and i wasted my money on a game i can't even play."

what is there not to like about this game (fuck the oppressors)
Better than what expected
"No, game is trash. I don't like at all."
good game i would suggest the lspdfr mod and online is absolute chaos!
Awesome game
spawn into the lobby: MKII blows you up respawn: MKII blows you up  10/10 would recommend
I like the old but gold game.
Punching people
Its pretty sick yo
Amazing game
"GTA isn't my type of series, but even beyond that, this game specifically is chronically unfun to play."
Objectively the best (video)game ever made  I would give that title to RDO but there's no content so here I am
"super fun, a bunch of things to do inside the game. And you can play with you're friends i would def recommend to play this."
keeps forcing me to do a job i dont want to do everytime i load up and is pissing me off so much i might have to woop someones ass in a minute!
fsefsfsfsefesse

theft.
all time best

gta 5 online is a fun experience destroying thug lvl 1s first car murdering anyone who gets to close gang wars its awesome you also get to own a business and there are tons of secrets and vehicles to collect so I recommend gta5

goated game
the game is so good like fr it is worth the price and i recommend you buying it if you like to have fun
"Yeah so uh... love the story mode, played it on Xbox and now on PC modded with a few things to make it look better. Hate online, and when I say HATE, I MEAN HATE! Online is just... horrible. It's still filled with exploiters, toxic people and a WHOLE lot of stuff that doesn't make any sense like flying cars and bikes. Also a freaking laser gun -_-. I genuinely wish they would remove all of these OP vehicles and just make it like Story mode where your options are Tank, Helicopter, or Jet. Not to mention the PTW with the shark cards, don't even get me started on that. Deserves a solid 4, (4 stars goes to the Story mode, 0 to Online)"
"2 words: strippers, c4"
i love the new update on the online mode
awe
GTA Online: Tons of buggy missions and no online support. Bad experience.  GTA is over-hyped imo.
it's insanely boring
good till now......
"two words, strip club"
the game is very fun with mods i highly reccomend
can't wait for gta 6

"Just Waiting for GTA 6, You know it Get ready bOys"
"Since there are already about a million different reviews of GTA V, with the consensus being that it's great, I've decided to forgo adding another generic review in praise of it. Instead, I'll review GTA Online as it stands in January 2024.[b] I'm marking this review as ""Recommended"", but that is entirely based on GTA V; my opinions on GTA V and GTA Online are completely different [/b][i](a big shocker, I know)[/i].    Since its launch in 2013, GTA Online has undergone several changes aimed at nudging players toward purchasing in-game currency with real money. The ever-increasing prices of items, vehicles, and properties with each game update are a push to boost the parent company's quarterly earnings rather than the parody of real-world inflation one might expect from Rockstar Games.   Online play does have its bright spots with some interesting new missions. Unfortunately, many of them are locked behind expensive properties purchased with in-game currency and offer little to no replayability. Lack of replayability may seem ironic in a game that can be categorized as grind-centric, but one gets the impression that this is intentional, or perhaps I'm wrong and it's just plain laziness on the part of the developers.   There is one significant negative that I haven't touched on yet, and that is the community, more specifically the 'modders'. I completely avoided joining public lobbies in my playing experience because the game is so infested with these individuals that it's almost impossible not to encounter some. I understand that not all of these people have malicious intentions, but enough do that it's worth avoiding the risk (and when I say risk, I mean it—the capabilities of some of these mod clients are [b]insane[/b]).   Overall, GTA Online has its moments, but the experience is diminished by things such as paywalls (specifically property missions) and modders, and I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on it.  [b]TL;DR: GTA V = Good, GTA Online = Bad.[/b]"

GOOOOOOOOOOOD
Games a classic and there is a reason it still sells like hot cakes to this day!
"So when i was actively playing it was actually fun.  I reinstalled it last Week and out of 50 lobbys i havent found a single one without modders.  Unless you play Private lobbys or singleplayer or exclusively do missions that take you out of open Multiplayer, there is no way i can recommend this game anymore. Cant wait for Gta 6 to be ruined."
i like gta 5 because its not overated like Fortnite
play fiveM
Its kewl beanz innit
if you dont know by now this review wont help
it is very fun and you get to do whatever you want in this game i recomend it
coo
I am bannad for yousing hacks. I like it wen I can play it. I love to se gta6
really good game from what i heard of and suprisingly it is
its very fun but online is broken to many hackers do I would reccomend but if you want to do online you really can't
"All in all, I do like the game itself. But as far as online multiplayer goes, I've encountered one too many cheaters, hackers, and trolls. The reason I'm saying ""Not Recommended"" isn't because the game is bad. The game all in itself is good. The problem is the PLAYERS. I'm saying ""Not Recommended"" because of how many players out there who choose to be bad sports. I still like this game, and I still play it all the time. You can too if you want. BUT... PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
i dont see this game getting big
turkey noodle soup

"like how is it that i try to do a bunker resupply mission and that these stupid ass merryweather people one shot me through the chopper, like how fucked up is your brain to develop ai like that like who would have the advantage to develop ai to fucking hard mode and shit like the fuck!? Rockstar if you are reading this message, FUCK YOU AND YOUR GAME AND FUCK GTA 5 GTA 4 IS WAY BETTER FUCK YOU"
great game 10/10
"hey cuitipy, want some cute photos?"
"Obviously i would recommend this game to the teens as i whos grown up playing the games in GTA franchise since 2006, Playing this game never makes me feel old and basically playing this would make me relax, feels me like a child again."
"franklin is the beginning stage for any gta player in any context, new and learning  michael is the middle stage, laid back but also pretty decent, fair at best at doing the job correctly  then there's insanity.  trevor is the definition of GTA online but you're the police"
greatest of all time game
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Only neghative thing is that there are an abundance of modders in almost every lobby but if they are chill itr isa ok but if they are not it is not that nioce.
es fun

"Great game, great story line, one of the games of all time."

"Good evening fellow Steam players. I am Dong Dong, a professional athlete and gamer for the Chinese people's republic and I am writing this review about the game Grand Theft Auto V on platforms such as Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox One.  This game resonates with me deeply. I have the freedom to do whatever I want in this beautiful masterpiece of a game, crafted by Rockstar Games. I've been playing this game a bit recently, it has helped me to cope with the loss of my family's Tibetan hound, Zonqinp. Zon was a positive influence in our household and it is sad to see him go, but thankfully I can pretend like he and his fellow deceased hounds, Qongchang and Seebodi, are with me in this digital experience.  All-in-all, this game is all I have ever wanted in a gaming experience. I recommend you to buy this masterpiece. Waiting for GTA 6 as well. Dong Dong signing off."
"its gta 5, rock star sucks"
how make money
W GAME
this gamer so awsome and so realistic
"Masterpiece, except when I randomly crash"
gej
I liked everything except the loading screen because it take forever to load. Other than that it is awesome.

goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooddddddddddddd
"still cool, after 2 year of not playing"
tuff ash game
the game is pretty good but u will not find a pc lobby without a modder most of the time they dont grief just get money
"My Rockstar account got hacked and I've been trying to contact them about it for days. I get the same default response asking for certain info every time. I send it to them and they reply with the SAME EMAIL asking for my information.   At one point they told me my ticket got updated and that I needed to log in to see the update. I CAN'T LOG IN my account got stolen, someone changed the email so I can't reset the password. Make sure to use two factor and change your password regularly because if you get locked out, you're not getting any help from Rockstar with the issue. Just some bot sending the same message over and over again. Good luck."
"I like the game overall but the main setback is how the people ruin the game. But other than the players, the games amazing"
good game. especially if youre getting carried by some no lifers in online
"Incredible Game, Really recomend it for everyone, Great Story mode, Fun to play around on Online mode, tons of missions, ways to get money, and super fun to play with friends Really recomend it with its value. Really recomend Buying Grand Theft Auto V!"
the Best game ever
lobes this game very fun to play and meet people
"The overall game is good, but Rockstar needs to stop constantly nerfing every way to get money in online. Pretty much every good way to get money has been cut down by like 50%. Why don't you try to fix the glitches instead, Rockstar? Or maybe listen to what people want?"
rthjt fasfaegsetgrehj6yoi   cool

Good game!

The Auto Theft wasn't Grand enough
It is fun... Kills time.

Single player is a 10/10. Online is goofy and troll filled but it's a literally playground for children when they get home from school.

Kat reference lol
i stabbed a hooker
"Here is a Ukrainian Garlic Bread recipe.  For the dough:  1 cup milk (250 ml) 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet) 2 Tablespoons sugar 2 Tablespoons oil (sunflower, avocado, or olive) 3 cups all-purpose flour (380 g) 2 teaspoons salt 1 egg beaten For the garlic oil: 3 Tablespoons oil (sunflower, avocado, or olive) 3-4 garlic cloves 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh dill 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley flake salt (optional)  INSTRUCTIONS   For the dough, warm the milk until it is between 80-100 degrees F. — just warm to the touch. Add the milk to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment or to a large bowl if kneading by hand. Add the sugar to the milk, then sprinkle the yeast on top. Whisk the mixture and allow it to activate and become foamy for about 5-10 minutes. Once the yeast is activated, add the oil to the milk mixture, then add the flour and salt. If using a stand mixer, start mixing the dough on the lowest setting. Once the dough starts to form a ball, increase the speed to medium and knead for 6-8 minutes. Alternatively, knead for 10-12 minutes by hand. The dough is done when it is elastic, glossy, soft, and easily comes away from the sides of the bowl/surface. Add the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a clean, damp kitchen towel. Let the dough rise for 1-1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size. Once the dough has risen and doubled in size, punch it down to remove the air, and transfer it to a clean surface. Form the dough into a rectangle, and then divide it into 8 equal-sized pieces; weigh each one to be exact. Form each piece into a ball by pinching the edges inward, and then on a flat surface, roll the dough into a ball shape. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Lightly grease a 9-inch round or square baking dish, preferably metal as opposed to glass or ceramic. Beat the egg for the egg wash. Place each ball of dough in the baking dish, with an equal distance between each ball. Allow the dough to rise a second time for 30 minutes, or until the rolls have puffed up and filled the pan. Brush the tops of the dough with the egg wash and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until deep golden brown. While the rolls bake, make the garlic oil mixture. Finely mince the garlic, then combine it with the oil, chopped dill and chopped parsley. Brush the garlic-herb mixture over the rolls immediately after they come out of the oven. Allow the rolls to cool for 15 minutes before serving. Pampushky can also be served at room temperature or reheated."
"the online is full of nothing but hachers and griefers, good luck playing this game"
"Good game. I think I missed some help prompts or something because swimming, and flying on the pc are a bit strange on the default controls. left-shirt, left-ctrl, numpad, and in combination with the a,w,s,d and using my mouse to fix the camera view every now and then is a bit weird by default but I wanted to try this using default settings."
Most of the fun I had with this game was just running people over 8/10
fock cadi bee in the oss
Fantastic!
after playing for 90 hours (not straight don't worry) rockstar games launcher freezes then crashes worst part is it was as soon as i bought rdr2 so you can say rockstar games scammed me
cant launch game
Rockstar killed FiveM
We all love and hate this game. It's funny as hell with friends but you often find yourself in a lobby with a hacker and have to join a new lobby to do your shenanigans without some dude spawning blimps on your head.
friendly friends

"After so many years, my first ever GTA V review is simply: worth it. Story mode kinda ok, beat only once and then online mode! Play with friends, explode them, you should be fine. Glhf."
play it
Buzzard go brrrrrrrrrrrr
gta but no five year olds

The game is great single player and in private online lobbies.  It keeps you coming back for more with a load of missions to do.
I dont care about gta online. The campaign is way better.
gta 5 is a great game
The Experiance
I LOVE THIS GAME SO FUCKING MUCHH BRP

just skip gta online all together and play any kind of fivem rp server. lobbies are full of griefers and randoms who make impossible to even get to any missions. just skip it
very fun and enjoyable :)
يسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسسس
I love the game but I will never forgive Rockstar for going all in on GTA: Online instead of more resources towards Red Dead Redemption 2.
gta6
I haven't played it for that long so I couldn't tell you
"the story mode is amazing, online on the other hand is absolute garbage"
the game is good

"You are forced to use the rockstar launcher, what a joke. 0 out of 10 unacceptable."
Awesome Graphics from Rockstar games.
"social club was hacked and now i cant even play the game. i have given steam ID, screenshots of receipts etc to rockstar and they still say no. terrible company."
civilians make horrible speed bumps
Best game to exist i just farted on my hand and this game made me like it
"The game is good. Rockstar please unban me, those 2 billion dollars I got in online with cheats were totally legit!"
very random i never got bored
funny to get banned on other launchers
"Essa jogo tem uma história muito boa, muitas pessoas jogam pela mecânica, mas quando paramos para analisar, a história aborda escolhas entre uma balança composta por família, amigos, dinheiro. Esse jogo nos passa a ideia de que temos que ter responsabilidade sobre certas situações, entendo o Michael trair seus parceiros de roubo por conta da família."
"No SP Update. No SP DLC.  Not buying from Rockstar anymore, they might as well be EA or Ubisoft at this fucking rate."
woohoo
Still one of the best games to this day
"Classic and very good game, online is kinda clunky and very modded on public online servers"
money game
no need to say anything.
"Since no one reads reviews anymore, I'll say that I'm gay and love cross-dressing as a femboy."
Amazing game!! Cant wait on next GTA 6
The game is fun. The story is good imo and online is great. You do have to grind for the things you want but with heists and owning a business it gets easier.
nice game hahaha
full of moders
Its GTA V
vc rouba coisas e tem uma moto q voa 10/10
i am waiting for gta 6
I didnt even steal 1 car!
"Servers are trash, game keeps crashing, modders are rampant, and god forbid rockstar decides to make dedicated servers. dont waste your money"
"BS game full of hackers and modders R* doesn't give a f**k, problems when starting the game lots of bugs after 12 years. Weak company 0 quality not recommanded. New version not available on PC. Hackers can easily hack your PC if u not careful. Mission rewards nerfed to 0 to force you buy shark cards. Hackers provide billions for much less money than R* + achiv/rank/etc. xD Should be ereased from the shop it's a trash. Multi-billion company my a** xDxD. Follow the example  of BG3 when choosing games and never settle for less. R* another company which follows profit and nothing more, seems like bad management 2 me... If u gonna play it do as everyone else and just mode trough the game xD"
this game is very very good I bought it because this game uhh I can't explain it for rockstar thank you
Good to have a Game like this to experience the sort of thing that we can't do in the real world. Great Game!
FUCK YEAH
"Looking to grind and create a criminal empire, play gta online!"
"Story Mode is still solid and fun to play. Online is still a messed up, toxic, glitch filled, and highly aggressive alternative reality like living the damn Purge or something. It shows people are sociopaths. A lot of them."
yeahhhh
best thing i ever bought
Women
fun game played since xbox 360
TOO GOOD GAME PERSONALY RECOMMENDED
"Well well well, Grand Theft Auto the Fifth. The singleplayer is solid, the online is complete shite and I wish rockstar would stop pumping resources into it. But hey its their cash cow, can't blame them too much."
jygtccc

AWESOME !!!
1 Nigger and 2 crackers come together to commit crime
10yo and still better than most games. everything has been said already. this game is freedom :)
GTA V is crap on PC all because of Rockstar Games Launcher. Genuinely useless and I cannot get the game to run with a fresh install and no mods - Rockstar Games get rid of this launcher - waste of money
The game is nice but if you have the problem of the starter pack just contact Rockstar support.
Amazing
cars.
i got blown up while doing cargo :C

Long loading screens for a 9 year old game
mhm
i have done horrible things. But fun
Having to play the prologue everytime i enter a net cafe just to play online is so time wasting and annoying. How have they not thought of this? If your account has experience on it than why do i have to do the prologue?
"realistic, have good discounts, fun to play with friends, and the game is very very realistic! I recommend you download it."
ITS SUPER FUN ESPECIALLY THE CLUB
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
"What can I say, it's GTA V. If you don't know, where have you been? :P"
"It's a chaotic sandbox where you can team up with friends, engage in wild criminal enterprises, and embrace the role of an aspiring kingpin. From high-stakes heists to wild races through the streets, GTA Online offers a never-ending playground for both cooperation and outright chaos."

Gta 5 is the best
duck honk yes
"fun game great for family time with my 9 year old son. when we get bored we ""browse"" the ""shoe store"". he really enjoys it. 10/10"
FUN TO PLAY AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE STORY AND EXPLORE THE FREE WORLD
"You forget a thousand things every day, don't make this one of them. ( Every other online lobby is filled with modders, PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK. R* support report in-game crashes the game, report through Steam or R* SC)"
"Story mode great, Online sucks so far. Looked away for 3 min and got carjacked and then before I could respawn to confront the player, the game crashes. Gonna watch my movie I was working on instead. Thanks Rockstar, Hope 6 isn't as much of a polished turd as this game is. Atleast you can still rampage throughout the city."
kinda good
good i lik3e
always play singleplayer
I hate this game
Mantappppppppppppp
Story is awesome Play online public if you wanna be blown up thousands of times
WONDERFUL
Literally a cheater in every single game doing something to ruin your day. This game literally sucks big doo doo and the developers don't do anything to stop the rampant cheaters.
"It's a really good game, simple as that. :)"
not if youre going to spend any money on shark cards

It's a fine driving simulator.
screw this
classic great gaming experience immersive

"I play only story mode but i don't know if i like it. GTA3, Vice city were huge but this one, i don't know. I can't go in the story, it's just not for me. And the 3 characters doesn't help. It's a little bit chaotic and not really interesting. It's just not fun at all."
Only a excellent game could have kept us entertained for the 10 years we have to wait for the 6 to come out
soo good real life like
Is GTA V of course is fun
out of the 14 hours I have in the game 13 of them are fighting with the launcher
good game i like to kill people
Good game. modders usually on pubs and give you free money
ITS GOODF
very good and great story game buy before gta 6 you have a while

The Best ever
"I am playing with 3 monkeys 3 hours, when we were about to finally do the heist it fucking droped my game <3"
we got cs2 before gta 6....
Works great on PC
Roleplay>online
"The Cutscenes, 10/10.  The Animations, 10/10.  The Characters, 10/10.  Now just imagine how GTA 6 would be."
GOOD GAME.
It's a must have.
"I always loved the GTA Series but this one is my favorite!!! In the Offline mode, the story between Michael, Franklin & Trevor is deep. It's fun to play between 3 characters. In the Online mode, you can create and customize your own character from head to toes, buy your own enterprise, apartments, cars, and play with many players from all around the world. After 10 years on this game, I never get bored. There're always updates every week in the multiplayer mode. Can't wait to see the next GTA VI..."
"Women still can't drive, realistic game."
this game's a masterpiece quite literally
never ever play online
I went to the strip club and they were all naked ew
fun to mod
Please if u want to play gta online do it on console! Do not play it on pc
this isnt childhood this is babyhood
it good for modding and greifing
"It's not the first time playing it. Played it on PS5 too. Great experience. The missions are overall great. Looking for  a crime, open-world game? You got this."

"The game doesn't let me play online , forces me to play Mall or Nothing .In the barber shop you can't change the colour of the face paint even tho there are given options."
the game's problem is its filled with modders and its annoying asf
dope game cant wait for 6
So many fucking moders/cheaters
its pretty addictive
why rockstar just why would you make it mandatory to: A- launch through the rockstar launcher B- make it fucking mandatory  to own a social club I now for no reason at all cannot play this fucking game that i bought
good gam
yes but i need my account back and um i dont know the password so can yall tell me how to delete scoil club account thanks
I can drive cool cars in races and then shoot people.
"hell yea boi hop on this extreme level good game.Michael sure said ""u forget a thousand things every day.How about u make sure this is one of 'Em"" but don't forget to play this frickin masterpiece indeed"
i love blowing 7 year olds up in a flying motorbike with missiles
"modders rule the lobbies. the online has become a ghetto version of the sims and half of the opportunities that make the game appealing with dlc's are negated by the toxicity of modders. what you think you are getting, is not actually what you are getting. if you dont plan on giving yourself everything of the get go with mods dont even bother to play the way rockstar projects this game to be."
there is a topless npc in the game
my pc exploded :)
rah
its a amazing game and one of the best
i have lost my gogle account and now i cant remeber my password or change it
Real life 101. Cant wait for GTA 6!
Worth for money one of the best !

Serious cheating problem for the last 10 years but never added an anti-cheat. Rockstar are just lazy af
Nice story mode

too many cheaters and hackers. lame ass game
good game but the system is shit.always crash
I liked everything about this game. It's so likeable
"Its a pretty good game, especially when i steal a cop car. (man i love cop cars!!!!)"
is it possible to make the bouncer's bounce that ass
Story is amazing.   Had a great time playing the game over the years with my friends in GTA Online.   But it has become stale recently since Rockstar stopped dropping massive updates for online.   I recommend this game but its time for it to die as its been out enough
To many modders
i just saw my first pair of boobies
This Game Better Than GTA San Andereas

very fucking nice
thi is a greate game
"GRATEST GAME OF ALL TIMES, THANK YOU ROCKSTAR!"
"i like playing most of the time but online has become a cancer that Rockstar doesn't care to fix. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. i go online there is a spam bot posting malicious links and hackers giving stuff to people, getting them wrongly flagged and banned. the community is toxic, the load times are ridiculous, and any and all updates are just more cash-grabs.   i hope gta 6 will do better but i highly doubt it."
i think yall should play this game
grand theft auto.
垃圾遊戲，原本刷錢就已經夠麻煩，唯一能夠刷的就只有佩里克島，現在連佩里克島都削了，又突然把我的錢吃了，rockstar你是想逼人開外掛刷錢是不是啊，刷錢外掛通通都抓，影響他人遊戲體驗的外掛你就放任不管，要玩家買鯊魚卡也不是這樣的吧，gta5已經沒有以前的快樂了。

THE GREATEST GAME
helll ya caught a tandum with some randoms game is great
"This is the most toxic game I have ever played. Full with trolls that are 500 levels ahead of you and probably paid for in-game currency only to kill you on first sight. The worst spent money in my life. The only place you can chill is in separate-world missions, which get pretty boring after some hours. Fuck rockstar _!_"
There are Guns
it's gta5
"Thumbs down. Great game, but I Paid for the criminal enterprise and shark card bundle of gta, told to wait 24-48 hours for it to come through. Followed the bullshit rockstar asked me to do uploading videos and receipts etc, pushing 60 hours now, nothing showing and rockstar not getting back to me. About to refund this shit. Playing since the day of release on numerous consoles and just got it from steam and it’s not working. If it’s not fixed by tomorrow I’m refunding the fuck out of this."
rockstar give me rdr 2
i love modders now im level 8000 with 50 mil by just afking
lemme know if there is a sex update
Filled with cheaters and the online is a loading screen simulator.
"Grand Theft Auto V, the epitome of subtlety and refined storytelling, takes you on a journey through the thriving metropolis of Los Santos. The game, with its profound depth and nuanced characters, challenges your intellect at every turn. The storyline is a masterclass in profound narrative, weaving together the tales of three utterly relatable and not-at-all clichéd protagonists. The satire is so subtle; you might miss it if you blink. The missions? Pure genius. Driving across the vast, meticulously crafted world is an absolute joy, especially when you encounter the awe-inspiring traffic AI. In summary, GTA V is a subtle, refined masterpiece, oozing with originality."
vERY BEST BUT LAGGING LOW
force closed game
by gta
VERY NICE GAME
grinds pretty slow shark cards arent worth the price but it sure is funny trolling broomstick rats with a submarine car
very gut game must play!
"this shit is ass. have fun restarting every 4 or 5 loading screens or so, of which there are many"
beautiful
ncc
"I would give this game a 5 star however, since playing it for a while now reduced it to 3 stars and not recommend it.  WHY?  Maybe I should start with the positives. 1.  ACTION packed 2. Myriad of things to do (purchases and missions etc) 3. Ability to play on or off line. (online/story mode) 4. Play together with friends.  Let's go with the negatives and my first big one is.  1. When you die, you're dead right?  Well, it seems some pansy queers get their panties tied in a knot and don't want to lose.  SHAME on RockStar which do things in 24 hour modes like getting through a bounty or breaking into the ""stash houses"", but this one thing gets to me.   When these people get shot at, or lose against you, they tend to chase you down to prove a point.  THEY ARE SORE LOSERS and refuse to lose.  So, they come after you and within the session MURDER you on and on and one.  There was one time I could not even get out of my session to go into another.    Another time this play was so close I could touch him, and I KNOW I eliminated them and low an behold, they didn't even fall and shot me once again.  Yeah, I would say 5 to 10 hits from the same person during that session/24 hour period would be more than enough.  SHAME on RockStar.  Maybe there should be a limit on how much you can be killed my ONE person during a session?  I mean enough is enough and when is too much enough?  It's like beating a dead horse at that point.  Move on losers and play on.  For Christ sake its only a GAME and that's how I look at it.  A GAME!  2. In the middle of a great win or lose battle, you get a ""network error"".  REALLY?  RockStar has a multi gazillion dollar enterprise...and it happens frequently.  I'm sure they'll blame that crap on my system...Pity on them.  3.  Little player ""clicks"" kick you out because your winning or you're not playing they way they want....cry babies.   Actually I don't mind going into other sessions....  Yeah, these are the negatives and overall will outnumber the positives if you really want to play this game.  I'm sure you got ""hackers"" in there as well.  Phantom players re-coding etc.    You wold think this company's been around a million years and would clean up some of these issues.  I mean, I know it's a cut throat game but I counted 51 kills on me and I was not even able to change my session but had to ALT/CONTROL/DELETE to shut the game down?  Yeah, it's like I said, it's beating a dead horse.  Are you dead enough yet?  The multi player section is cool if you can find other players.    Yeah, play at your own risk.  Could be a fun game though."
car go boom
very cool game
cool game i love commiting mass killings
yuh cummy
From Mixi with love <3

Hallo Steam Apakah Kamu Bisa Mengembalikan Gta 5 Ku? Saya Tidak Sengaja Menekan Hide This Game Dan Saya Tidak Tau Harus Berbuat Apa
"The Grand Theft Auto series is fun. Rockstar makes really good games (RDR2 being the greatest game of all time). However, GTA5 Online is riddled with cheaters/modders that they have completely destroyed the game play experience. To the point that I'm honestly surprised there hasn't been a class-action lawsuit against Rockstar for refusing to fix the issues. They have pretty much put patches on the back burner to focus solely on GTA6. They should be sued into oblivion for allowing this to go on. If they can't put anything into GTA Online that doesn't generate money, they wont do it. This includes security patches. It should be a criminal offense what they are doing; Selling a product without fixing major game breaking issues.  Don't waste your time with it."
play online better
good n shit
gamenya ok tp temen kek anjing

"Title: ""Los Santos' Sinful Playground: A Review of GTA 5's Vanilla Unicorn Strip Club""  Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)  Welcome to the provocative world of the Vanilla Unicorn, Los Santos' premier strip club and nightlife destination in Grand Theft Auto 5. Brace yourself for a rollercoaster ride of neon lights, seductive dancers, and an atmosphere that's both tantalizing and controversial.  Ambiance: The Vanilla Unicorn boasts a lively and vibrant atmosphere, complete with pulsating music, colorful lighting, and an eclectic mix of patrons. The club exudes a sense of decadence, capturing the essence of a high-end adult entertainment venue. The attention to detail is commendable, from the smoky ambiance to the realistically rendered pole-dancing routines.  Entertainment: The main attraction, of course, is the talented lineup of exotic dancers. Each performer showcases unique moves and choreography, adding variety to the visual spectacle. The club also features private dance rooms for a more intimate experience, providing players with a taste of the risqué side of Los Santos nightlife. While the explicit content is clearly intended for a mature audience, the animations and performances are well-executed within the context of the game.  Interactivity: Players can engage in various activities within the club, such as enjoying a drink at the bar, playing a game of darts, or even partaking in a private dance. The interactive elements add depth to the overall experience, allowing players to immerse themselves in the virtual nightlife of Los Santos.  Controversy: It's essential to acknowledge the controversial nature of the strip club in the game. While it serves as a virtual space for adult-oriented entertainment, some players may find the explicit content uncomfortable or offensive. Rockstar Games, the developers, have aimed to create an authentic depiction of a certain aspect of city life, but individual sensitivities may vary.  Conclusion: The Vanilla Unicorn is a well-crafted and immersive addition to GTA 5's open-world experience. It successfully captures the allure of a high-end strip club, providing players with a taste of the glitzy and risqué side of Los Santos nightlife. Whether you're there for the mesmerizing dance performances or to explore the interactive elements, the Vanilla Unicorn offers a unique slice of digital decadence that contributes to the diverse tapestry of activities in the game. Just be mindful of the explicit content if you're easily offended, as the club doesn't shy away from its adult-oriented theme. So, step into the neon-lit world of the Vanilla Unicorn and let the virtual decadence unfold. 🌟💃🍸"

"im lazy and dont want to write a review so i asked chatgpt to write one for me. (this game is good, i didnt pay attention to the story, didn't finish it as well)  chatgpt: GTA V is an absolute masterpiece that seamlessly blends thrilling gameplay, a gripping narrative, and a sprawling open-world environment. Rockstar Games has delivered a gaming experience that raises the bar for the industry. With its engaging storyline, diverse characters, and the vast city of Los Santos to explore, GTA V remains a timeless classic, offering endless hours of entertainment and excitement. The attention to detail, combined with the seamless integration of single-player and online modes, ensures that GTA V continues to captivate players, making it a must-play for any gaming enthusiast."

"rockstar sucks ass, wont unlink my account, now i cant play. at all"
you get to do a lot of crimes and thefts
real ly good
"i decided to purchase the game for PC (previously played on console) to relive the singleplayer i remembered so fondly.  didn't let me play the game i purchased because my social club was registered under the wrong email.  no option to switch email, or make a new one, it insisted i log in with the older email which i no longer had access to, and support ran me in circles for multiple days before outright not solving my issue, meaning i was stuck with a piece of bloatware i couldn't play, it wouldn't even launch without the login, i'm sure there was a third party way of getting around it, but i instead opted to refund the game through steam, saved me a whole lot (more) headache.  to be clear; this didn't simply lock me out of GTA online, or participating in multiplayer content, this login locked me out of the base gameplay, the singleplayer storyline, that i PAID for.  dogshit company, don't support them."
ITS REALLY FUN
Shiesty as hell
"one of my favs, been playing since launch in 2013"
"The best anti-cheat in the world, no joke. literally never seen a modder in over 50 hours now!"

Good time no alcohol required
"fun go to the shoe shop when you download, marked with high heels on the map"
tis very fun
great ass game lmao
"Would be a great game without that Rockstar social login cancer. You buy the game on steam, you pay for it, then if whatever happens to your rockstar social login (that you did not ask for and did not know prior to buying the game), you cannot play the game anymore as your steam profile gets linked to that particular rockstar social login (that you did not want or paid for, you as a retard thought you were paying for the game, but Rockstar does not care). Anyway, one day you reinstall the game thinking you can replay it, well your steam profile got linked to that initial rockstar login, so if you can't access it then bad luck, you can't play the game!!! Can you unlink that rockstar login cancer from steam? No you can't. Did rockstar get your money? It sure did. Just do yourself a favor and don't buy it anymore. If the social login cancer returns in GTA6, just don't buy that either."
I switched from playstation to PC and my first lobby that I joined within the first 10 minutes of playing a modder trapped me in a gun store and started spawning money and giving me rp. In less then a minute i went from level 1 to level 25 with an extra 100k.
wow good

good game but long downloads
One of the best games ever to experience in a lifetime. Amazing game to chill with friends!
"Mediocre story story wise, and horrible online wise. Rockstar refuses to do anything about the cheaters. They're more concerned with removing 200+ cars than the safety of their game."

"Grand Theft Auto V is one of the most played games and it speaks for itself. It has one of the best story modes alongside an insane online mode, too. This game is good for people who just want to play by themselves and also good for people who want to play with friends. It's a win, win! It also has an amazing open world with many things to do so you'll never get bored. This game is one of my favorite games of all time and it can be yours too if you just give it a shot."
One of the best games of all time.
Very fun gamed

"1 word, modders"
everybody should have this game
I can no longer recommend this game (or at least the online part anyway). The campaign is amazing but I literally can't get through 5 minutes of playing online before modders glitch the crap out of the game and make it impossible to play.
"rockstar has completely abandoned the pc version of the game. it is nothing but modders, modders and modders. they can make the screen flash and cause seizures as my daughter has found out. i do not recommend paying for this game. far better games out there that actually ban modders. gta is not that game, and rockstar is not that company."
"However, GTA Online is filled with hacked players.  I really wish rockstar would address this major issue"
GRAND BAND MY OLINE
"very fun, very ham"
best game ever !!!
game good
Find hacked lobbies and its op!!!!!
Frankilin is my homieeeeeeeeee

"I don't recommend this game after 1,000 hours because of Rockstar's insistence on lowering the quality of their product. GTA 5 is a great game, no real complaints there. GTA Online was great as of 2020. Since then they've done everything they can to time-gate progression thru lower payouts and by removal of roughly 180 vehicles. Said vehicles can still be accessed with GTA +, their new premium service. Two problems with this being, one it costs a monthly fee and two it's not out for PC. Also trying to play in a public session without modders is almost impossible. Rockstar knows about these cheaters, they've been in the game since release and little has been done about it. However, if there is a money exploit, they're quick to patch it out. If you encounter an issue online and need help good luck getting a hold of customer service, they've ripped their phones from the wall. Now you can message them and hope you get someone competent. Honestly with their recent performance I expect GTA 6 to be more of the same.  TLDR This game gets a 4/10 for quality control issues. Rockstar prioritizes monetization of the community."
VERY GOOD GAME
graphics and realism
"Story is good, I cannot comprehend why there's no story rich tag."
"if u have a good pc, its fun. if not do not buy"
verry verrry good
is just a good game :D
good game i were love it i where wait 10 year to play this love you rockstar
good love it
it was too fun for me to play
My rate: 10/10  Graphics good  characters amazing and very deep  the world is very amazing in a conclusion my opinion doesn't matter we all know what GTA is and what rockstar games is
"Cool game, nice gameplay and graphics. Recommended"
Its sick
very skibidi sigma game
game is so good
ITS FUN TO PLAY
"- story is pretty disjointed & side quests are boring - no single player dlcs - no gay strip club - online mode is full of hackers - shark cards  However, the game world is very nice for modded game modes like LSPDFR or Roleplay"
best gamw
need players in gta 5
"Just a buggy shit game, never gonna be fixed and GTA 6 is gonna be just a terrible"
MMust reccomend this game really good graphics and all is good
"This game was great when it first worked properly. However, I reinstalled the game to replay it and I couldn't run it as it kept saying the game was running when it wasn't. I even did everything I could to make it work but it didn't fix the issue"
fun and very good after getting businesses
bad!
"Good game if you have friends. alright game solo.  If you play with friends you will most likely have a great time. There is enough stuff to do that someone in your group will make the dumbest mistake in a heist or will spend $5 million on a vehicle that is terrible just to be bullied for it. Yes the online can be very grindy at times and you might run into a fair few modders. But my experience with modders has been mostly fun with them doing random stuff with the lobby to have a laugh only 2 or 3 where in it to ruin the game for others.   Story is very nice, I enjoyed it."
VERY GOOD\
this is it boys the year before gta 6
The Game Is So GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Hackers 0 anti cheat buy on Xbox or PS if you intend to play online at all   (I am sure the game is fun if you cheat to)
Its just better
EVERYTHING
"Four players online dressed up in clown outfits and beat me up. Once I respawned, they hunted me down and beat me up again.  5/7 would play again"

"TA V is an open-world action-adventure game that offers an immersive and thrilling gaming experience. The game features a vast and detailed world, filled with engaging missions, diverse characters, and a captivating storyline. With its stunning graphics, realistic gameplay mechanics, and a wide range of activities to engage in, such as heists, races, and exploration, GTA V keeps players hooked for hours. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to the franchise, GTA V is definitely worth checking out for its sheer entertainment value and the freedom it offers to create your own adventures in the virtual world."

Where's the singleplayer dlc??
i ran a dude over 10/10
"meow, ruff"
Very good game cant wait till 6 comes out.

"This game is a ton of fun.  The single player campaign is really good, and the open world keeps being interesting.  Playing with your friends is a blast, but the open multiplayer lobbies are hit and miss... you will commonly see maxed-out griefers, exploiters, and straight-up cheaters."
such an amazing game  with endless play always something to do
Middle Fingers Up
Bro its gta 5 buy it
"guns, gangs, drugs, violence, stripper & cars"
This game made me kidnap a woman because a guy was a tad bit of an asshole 10/10
been playing this game for over 9 years and theres never been a point i havent found it fun
i love to throw 99999 degree honeybuns at the homeless people on gta 5 i cannot wait to see the quality on gta 6 when i go 120 mph through a group of hitch hikers
i set tracey on fire
really fun great game but its annoying how much things people have because i have almost nothing and bad weapons and everyone destroys me. i have fun killing NPCS and love it.
Very fun!
For the Best online experience use FiveM servers. It should have been Rockstars direction for their multiplayer
too many modders but its gta 10/10 game ofc
69 :D
cool game ig
YES IS A good game
Thia game is so broken it hurts
fuck the stupid launcher
not fun
me and my friend went to the strip club and showed me a pair of boobs
strip club make my sad nights alone feel loved
hggfg
its fucking sucks therefore i will keep playing it.
its literally gta what is there not to liek
nothing
"If you love playing with modders, this is the game for you. Every lobby is these little twig bois trying to show off how good their mods are. Rockstar does literally nothing to stop it. Good luck paying for GTA6 and getting the shame lame shit."
"Amazing game, graphics top notch the story is amazing! Although the story is a bit short compared to other Grand Theft Auto, the amount of detail put into the story is insane! The game is worth buying."
still fun after all these years
"Absolutely worth it. I'm 250 hours into online and have just scratched the surface. Haven't even started story mode which is a whole other thing. Every minute is fun, always something to do. Recommend strongly."
peepeepoopoo
tiddies
Just fun
"Singleplayer und GTA:Online allein bieten echt schon unglaublich viel Content, der bock macht. Die Story zu spielen lohnt sich meiner Meinung nach sehr. Online in öffentlichen Lobbys zu spielen ist ein absolutes Sh#tfest, spielt lieber in Lobbys mit Freund:Innen. Mit Mods, FiveM und RageMP auf jeden Fall eine der aktivsten Moddingcommunitys, die es gibt."

"Cashgrab, only good for mods imo, try LSPDFR , THE ULTIMATE POLICE SIM"
"San andreas was the Best gta this doesn't come close, I got this game for the 3rd time tho rockstar are very undeserving of that. I got this  for the mods. To many trainee apprentices doing all the work at half the wages while rockstar CEO's pocket all the money, my biggest issues are the  Running and the movement of the Player its all restricted and slow and the shooting is meh and the map doesn't have the freedom feeling and sense of journey that san andreas had but its still an OK game 7/10"
"never buy this game, from the people playing it, to the devs that run it. this is a abomination not only by man, but by all life. (yes im waiting for GTAVI to drop stfu)"

"gta 5 is such a classic, who actually hates this game??????????"
perfect game  will recommend to everyone
Didn't realize I have spent too much time playing the game. Enjoying it very much
"Very buggy on pc and Rockstar glazes the console version of this game. Heists bug out and kicks everyone youre playing with out of the lobby. For example on The Cayo Perico heist when youre trying to use the key cards on doors, your character will just stand there and do nothing. Other times guards will catch you even though you havent killed anybody and youre out of sight. Sometimes when you take the primary target it wont count and it wont be added to your payout.   If youre two people playing the Diamond Casino heist and you reach the tunnel before the vault, the game will kick both you and the other player out of the session. These are issues theyve had for a while but theyve never bothered to fix it. Theyre a half assed staff who dont care as much for pc compared to Playstation and Xbox. Some people experience different bugs than what my friends and i have, but it still bothers me that these are common issues and they dont care to fix it. I understand they are working on gta 6 but still.  Mind you ive played over 300 hours on the ps4 and ps5 version of the game and ive never experienced a bug whatsoever."
"What I like about the game is that when you start you can go to the R mission at the top of the map and there are a series of missions. The guys name is Dax and if you complete all 6 of his easy missions you get 500 grand, great starting tip for new online players"
highly recommend
Just play the story mode NEVER start online
man i buy gta v but to mothe ago say buy agin why man for what
wish rockstar would stop taking shit away and nerfing s h i t but all in all fun game especially when you have friends to play with
i cant play gta 5 beacause of error
ZASRANA PICOVINA MRDTA TU HRU DO ZAD :roflanfu:
"I play GTA solely for the storytelling aspect. However, the story ends quite abruptly like they just ran out of budget and decided to cut it short. The last score is a letdown, it's just another heist but with a bigger cut. The final antagonists you have to kill are pretty forgettable. The map is big but feels empty, especially outside of the city. It's a step down from GTA IV in term of story. R* also never released a single DLC for singleplayer a decade later, which is very telling about their priorities.  For R* standard, this would be considered a negative review."
i like that it is free rome i do think the shark cards are a bit much on the high side where the game does cost a lot but over all its amazing
I am wanted in 30 states
Great car stealer 5

"less hoes, more men!"
"Unfortunately, GTA Online has killed by cheaters and lack of balance  Can't complete single mission in this game. When I'm trying to complete mission, someone on a flying bike (!) with rocket launcher on it (!!) just destroying me and im surely losing.  Dear Rockstar Games, how do you want me to fight with that, when i have only 10 level and just basic weapons?  I'm happy that people donated you to get this stuff, but what about balance? Excuse me, I just joined the game, I can't do nothing with people on a fighterbombers and invulnerable cars! Of course that's a competition in the game, but that should be at least a little balanced!  I wanted to play GTA Online so much, but after 63 hours in this game all what I can say - a huge dissapointment"

Its GTA V bro peheli nehi khela hai toh ma chudao

gta5 is good
"online sucks, too much modders but the story is good"

Its a great game with hours of entertainment. And even more if you have friends to play with you.
"Used to be really fun. Rockstar games launcher is a broken piece of shit, so it's unplayable now. Great job Rockstar. Keep it up."
Крутая игра.
"Fun game,  crap online experience w/ modding but once you learn and get protections,  it can be fun."
ASS
GREAT GAME!!!!
Always have and always will love this game
LOL
You cant play offline
The best game
its really a great game and realistic
sex update when?
Many players use third-party cheating software to make the game completely meaningless. Why do third parties still claim to sell cheating software in the game after purchasing GTA5.

DO NOT BUY! Your account could get hacked and after a month of communicating with Rockstar they will still not help you! Waste of money!

this game so good
"I 100% recommend this game. This game is life. This game taught the importance of life. Taught me how to do my first robbery, my first stolen car, my first stabbing my first hustle, my first drug deal, how to make drugs and sell them, taught me how to be a pimp, own my first escort, how to run a strip club and how to talk to girls all real life scenarios. So if you wanna learn buy how to tutorial :)"

"it's gta, literately everyone knows this game, easy 10/10 no real review needed"

"I mean it is GTA, what else do I need to say?  Still looks and feels modern in 2023, which is a testament to how well made it is."

Good Story online just a Money grab from Rockstar
Story mode - 11/10 Online - Boo
WOW
Its literally a Rockstar Game Its the best game
My Dashboard：Ticket #27172702  tell me what happened?
I loaded into the game and within the first 2 hours of GTA Online I was given every trophy so I couldn't have fun through getting them legitly. This also blocked me from getting the call from simeon therefore not being able to buy anything.
experience is good
"Pros -Great story -great map -realistic map and highway exits and ramps -heists are the ""raids"" of this game -crime tycoon  cons -online economy inflation -can be a grind fest if you're focused on getting bread.  in summary, shit goes hard"
"Grand Theft Auto V is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure game that offers an immersive and thrilling experience. From the moment you step into the fictional city of Los Santos, you're greeted with a living, breathing world filled with endless possibilities.  The game's storyline follows three protagonists, each with their own unique backgrounds and personalities, which adds depth and variety to the gameplay. You'll get to know Michael, a retired bank robber trying to live a peaceful life, Franklin, a young hustler looking for his big break, and Trevor, a volatile and unpredictable character.  One of the standout features of GTA 5 is its vast and dynamic open world. Los Santos feels alive, teeming with pedestrians, bustling traffic, and a variety of activities to engage in. Whether you want to participate in high-speed police chases, engage in thrilling heists, or simply explore the city's stunning landscapes, there's always something to keep you entertained.  The game's attention to detail is remarkable. The graphics are stunning, with incredibly realistic visuals that bring the city and its inhabitants to life. The level of immersion is further enhanced by a phenomenal soundtrack, which features a wide range of genres and perfectly complements the fast-paced gameplay.  GTA 5 also introduces an online multiplayer mode called GTA Online, where you can team up with friends or other players from around the world to tackle missions, participate in races, or just wreak havoc together in the city. This adds a whole new dimension to the game, providing endless hours of fun and excitement.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece in the gaming world. It combines a gripping storyline, a massive open world, stunning visuals, and an online multiplayer mode that keeps you engaged for hours on end. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to the franchise, GTA 5 is a must-play for any gamer seeking an adrenaline-pumping experience."
failed multiple heists because someone drove into a gas station

I only play this game for the strip club

you know whats this game is awesommmmmm
11/10 the most addicting game I have ever played
it would be alooot better without the rockstar launcher
WONT LET ME PLAY
Good Game - stop asking me about it please
"Fantastic game. Rich world, fun ass gameplay, endearing characters. Just play it."
yippee
Absolutely awful if you want to play with friends. Every time you enter a mission with friends you get thrown into lobbies with randoms and not able to connect with friends even though you all enter at the exact same time. Can't even invite them to missions.  They managed to take GTA and sucked all the fun out of it.
100/10
this game is very fun and gooood i forgot i have it for 2 years lol
"Game still looks good in 2024. I am glad they never stopped updating the online content of the game. I just wished though that they have added more single player content and story. I think that would have been awesome including the mystery in Mt. Chilliad. UFOs coming to life as if there is an invasion. More gang-related stories for Franklin. Coming of old Los Santos characters such as CJ, Tenpenny, etc."
"When I was 12-13, see the graphics I was like ""OMG! How realistic!"",  but now I'm 20: ""Hmm, the graphics is nice, it's ok"""
Excelent game
You forget a thousand things everyday. Make sure this is not one of them.
Tracy and Molly are hot
i saw a tik tok that told me to go to the shoe store on the map with my mom in the room and have her help me pick up a pair. I was told to go to the secret areas behind the curtains to see a lady. for some reason my she took off her clothes?
robbin cars n shit
it's cool
rockstar a joke have modders that ruin the game
"""Why did I move here? I guess it was the weather."""
"This game is pretty good i rate 8/10 ,missions pretty ehh i rate 6/10"
Do a heist then wait a month to do it again. Fun but gets boring fast
"There are so many hackers on here now the game is no longer fun. It used to be just every once in a while, and they would just do goofy stuff, now they are just causing issues for all other players and can remove you from the sessions. I know the new GTA is going to come out soon, but if they are still trying to make money off this  one they should at least be policing it."
nivyg
they banned me even though i did not do anything wrong.
"If your reading this go in story mode and use code ""TOOLUP"" for and RPG AK47 Handgun Sniper rifle Grenades and a submachine gun and if your run out of amo reuse the code for more ammo"
"Not much to say, we all know it one of the best."
Go in private lobby to avoid all the toxic players and cheaters especially on PC
"its almost impossible to make money if you dont have a 4 man crew. if you dont have a 4th person to play with you then its not fun at all because you cant do heist. it just makes everything so hard. kinda sucks that its that way bc the game is super fun if and when you have money i have a buisness that makes you alot of money but you have to have alot of money to start and upgrade it ive have played the game for 12 hours since i bought the business and its less than  a quarter if the way till i can sell my ""product"". other than that the game is so amazing. if you have 3 other friends to play it with."
Its GTA
Easy control
theres something seriously wrong with me to think GTA Online is a decent thing to play without using mods lmfao
SO GOOD OF A GAME BUT I MEAN DONT WHEN I SAY DONT LET YOUR DANG 7 YEAR OLDS PLAY THIS DANG GAME
mods go brrrrrrrrrr
best game ever created
I recommend GTA. Not GTA online
i couldnt download the rockstar game launcher
endless posibilties
You need to spend the first ten minutes trying to pass the  MOST STUPID test to prove you are human. I have a top secret security clearance and the government doesn't make me do such idiotic log in tests. IT'S A F***ing video game!
i have played gta for over 500 hours on many devises and i say that it is amazing

"Game is crawling with God Mode/NoRagdoll losers abusing mod menus, Rockstar doesn't give a shit. Game can still be fun at times and you'll often find chill people playing but for the most part the game is full of trolls abusing god mode trying to make the GTA Online experience as miserable as possible for legitimate players. As if trying to make money legit in this game wasn't tedious enough- enjoy getting harassed by losers on power trips at the same time."
Really good story and really good to play with friends. sucks that thier are a bunch of toxic and hacker people on online mode but other than that its really fun
sfbsvsbdvedvdsvewefewveswa
"You don't need any review to know just how awesome, retro and unique this game is! I love Rockstar and their masterpiece games!"
"At this point, you've probably played the story mode of GTAV, so you're looking at maybe GTA Online or something.  It is 100% not worth it. Rockstar has specifically designed it to be an incredible time- and money-sink. Their lackluster anti-cheat systems mean legitimate players trying to play the game are outnumbered by bots instantly killing players from all over the map.  Dumb as heck. 0/10."
Extremely Fun game. One of my favorites
goooooood
amazing game but please add a workshop too it
It's fun actually been playing this game since 2013 still can't stop playing till this day
i liked the game

"CRIMINAL STARTER PACK IS NOT FUCKING WORKING! I PAY FOR Premium Edition & Whale Shark Card Bundle AND GET NOTHING AT ALL!! also game is ok, but have too many bugs on online."
"I personally love GTAV its story, online and everything is just perfect. Now im waiting for GTA6 haha."
this is not a game its my emotion
"Grand Theft Auto 5 (stylized as Grand Theft Auto V) is the 15th overall installment and 5th installment of the main series of games known as Grand Theft Auto, a third-person shooter game set in the fictional version of Los Angeles known as Los Santos dveloped by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. The game follows 3 main protagonists Michael De Santa a film buff and former bank robber in witness protection who following a series of events must come out of retirement, Trevor Philips an old friend and crew member of Michael's who must finds out his old friend never actually died during their final heist which went wrong, and Franklin Clinton a small-time street gangster whom Michael takes under his wing and mentors into being a better criminal.  Grand Theft Auto V's story is full of great characters, a great story itself, and very memorable moments. Aside from that is the aptly titled Grand Theft Auto: Online which offers an experience great for friends and parties, just don't hang around freemode or expect a rocket to the face."
good game but community not for beginners

"Abandon Singleplayer,   Forced DRM with no way to undo an account link. if you lose your R* account, you lose all your R* games everywhere. Don't buy R* games if you want to use any of your purchased products. This should not be allowed on steam to enforce this kind of DRM which also breaking family shearing (another way to force more purchases).   If your forrce people to use your store, then only sell it there! But wait... then noone would buy it. :-)"
"Super fun. plus its gta 5. if you aint got it, you weird"

"To this date, GTA V is still simply the best."
fucking server loading
The game is good but there is a problem with the online session there is alot of modders wandering in the session making the game freeze.
"I am a 45 -year -old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father raising my son, who is now 14 years old. My son won this game from his uncle, so we installed him on his computer and he started playing. Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game. This was horrible for me, because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son, because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube. So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him. I bought the game, chose my skin and world and started playing, but I was stuck in what you should do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died. Since then, this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well. This game reminded me that there is fun in everything, and I brought many happy memories to me and my son."
its really good but to many modders
dude this game is awsome
W game no cap

silly trampling over ppl game

AMAZING GAME
this game can make me cry and want to kill myself so its a pretty good game in my eyes
hiests
how tf we in 2024 and not have a crossplay with other platform its been 11 year when the game first released and we still dont have cross play
The game hasnt changed. Always been a blast
"Cool story, amazing modding support. Annoying with how large it is but overall a good game."
"Good game, just a few bugs with bundles"
I skinned a hooker alive in 2002
IT WAS A GOOD GAME
very funny especially with friends although if your patient enough to wait a year you can get gta6 the only reason why i did cause of my other friends so would could play together. And if you are the only one with gta 5 there is still a great storyline to play and discover
Unforgettable part of my memory can wait to see what GTA 6 has in store!!!.
Online very fun big fun with friends
Welcome to Los Santos!
Cool game dawg
My friend who I play Grand Theft Auto Online with said if I post a review on Grand Theft Auto V and it gets 200 likes and 50 Awards that he will buy me an RTX 4080 So im just gonna leave this here.
"this is the best game ever made, can't change my mind"
"play game, meet very generous person. gain 100 level in 2.2 seconds. great game"
yes strip ahhhh
"amazing, but too many hackers"
Its really amazing and very fun and i highly recommed.
"Great game for interactive open world experience. Crossplay is a NO. big sad. ""multiplayer"" game in this modern world with to ability for PC players to play with Console players.   Rockstar, please consider catering to the community of your player base -   PLEASE ADD CROSS PLAY TO PC/PS4/XBOX before releasing GTA 6 or slightly after :)  -Much love for the hours enjoyed, StalinFX"
Still holds up after all this time. Plays great and haven't had a single issue so far!
best gta game ever

Smd Rockstar. Stories great but online has become a complete shit hole. Join a pub lobby and prepare to be Ddos'd by a modder flying a UFO tracing IP's and locking people in cages. Also Rockstar has a tendancy to ban random accounts and then ignore unban requests.
nice game made me feel like gamer

You know if your buying this you either have nothing to do with your life or you were born in 2008 - 2016 then your probably playing the infamous GTA: Online if you have found yourself in this dark place in your life please seek help for this is a dark path to fall down it is a spiral down a infinite staircase and it is a ugly trip that you can't stay home for and the thing about this is if you quit you will just return to satisfy your addiction to purchase everything and grind to your burial (800) 273-8255

"Still a damn good game with plenty of hidden things to find in game and online.  Can be pretty toxic though online, hit or miss what you're going to find."
Funsiessss
NEEDS MORE ANIMATIONS AT VANILLA UNICORN
good balls
i didn't know you could do stuff in online so i just killed civilians for 13 hours
"Single player still holds up, great game. Online is fun but full of cheaters. There's [i]at least[/i] one in every lobby."
its a good game. over 10 years old but still good. ( if your not playing online )
very fun. i like stopping at stoplights and acting like a human.

"cool,good,nice,pisses off."
"its GTA V idk what else to say lol good game, some of the people suck tho"
"LOVE THIS GAME! "" just gets lonely by yourself"
Lester was on the island and I'm not talking about El Rubio's island
big dog big nutz
I love the game it is fun as hell. You can get really mods for free. It make the game even more fun! If you play the on online mode you well have a lot of fun. you might make fends but there might be a modern. I love this game so much!!
why the fuck are there so many random crashes
"i think this is a wonderful game, cant wait to play gta 6"
story mode : what do you expect from rockstar  online mode: grind money grind money grind money buy a  cool car worth all you grinding grind money grind money and repeats  if you wanna play the online i don't recommend it without friends. its a great game when you have friends to play with . one of my best gaming era was gta online. making story films with in game editor( canceled because of a stupid  in grope fight) hanging out in lobbies killing each other. playing the heist and races. ah good old day i miss it
Single player is good. Just beware of the janky online mode.
Its awesome! Great graphics and stuff!
super gooddddddddddddddddd
Hope you dont get exploded within 5sec of joining an Online Session
good game would recomend
"Normally i would recommend this game but after my recent game plays in online half of the servers are filled with modders that kill you and troll you, but on the other hand if your playing story mode its not that bad, the story has a nice lure and got great graphics which means that you need a more upgraded PC to play it."
very good game unfortunate that it took forever for gta 6 to come out but definetly fun to explore and drive around
"Go to the club, many boobles there."
Proper grinding game
its very kid freindly
FUN GAME ENJOY BLOWING UP PEOPLE AND KILLING STUFFS
really gooooooood
hnfg
Fun to annoy ppl
Best game ive ever played
"honestly can't go wrong buying it, playing solo is kinda painfull becuase earning money is impossible because of cayo nerf, if u just want to fly around in cool cars and planes get kiddions mod menu from ""unknownCheats.com"" follow a guide on how to get money, its not bannable and it saves you grinding for days and it also can help agianst mk2 nerds becuase there is mod to remove you from the radar try not to interact with modders who are lagging or interacting with the gta world because they will crash ur pc if you so much as breathe on them, do be warned game gets very boring after you download a mod menu because you unlock everything, sense of pride and progressions is obliterated"
I was told this was a Dora the Explorer game
veri gud geim bui it or juu aar gei
"Online is trash! Rockstar keeps making it harder and harder to enjoy the game by removing and altering aspects to make it as grindy and unfair as possible. To top it off, they do not have the capabilities to fix the hacking infestation that exists on pc.  So if you are not getting murdered by npcs with overpowered aimbot, you are getting griefed by a hacker who has never washed their ass!  Save yourself the money, Rockstar is not the same company it once was when GTAV released."
"great game if you have friends (schizophrenia will work too) and an unstable state of sanity, also no bitches, and time, also if you like to be blown up oppressors"

BIG W GAME I LOVE IT
"GTA V is nothing short of a masterpiece in the world of open-world gaming. Rockstar has created an immersive, sprawling landscape that captivates players from the very beginning. From the intricate storyline to the stunningly detailed Los Santos, every aspect of the game is a testament to the developers' dedication and craftsmanship.  Despite my laptop's modest specs, the game runs surprisingly well, providing a smooth and enjoyable experience. The optimization is commendable, allowing me to delve into the rich narrative and explore the vast cityscape without sacrificing performance.  The characters are brilliantly crafted, each with their unique personalities and story arcs that kept me engaged throughout my 12-hour gaming session. The missions are diverse, offering a perfect blend of action, strategy, and humor. The attention to detail is astounding, making Los Santos feel like a living, breathing city.  Whether you're a fan of intense heists, adrenaline-pumping car chases, or simply want to roam a meticulously designed open world, GTA V has it all. The multiplayer mode adds another layer of excitement, providing endless opportunities for collaboration and competition.  In summary, GTA V is not just a game; it's an experience. It's a testament to Rockstar's commitment to delivering top-notch gaming adventures. If you haven't played it yet, you're missing out on one of the greatest gaming experiences of our time.  Pros:  Incredible open-world design Engaging storyline and characters Optimized for a variety of hardware Diverse and exciting missions Multiplayer adds extensive replay value Cons:  None worth mentioning Conclusion: GTA V stands tall as a must-play title for any gaming enthusiast. Rockstar has set the bar high, and this game continues to shine as a beacon of excellence in the gaming industry. The game is too good and the online gta is fantastic!!"
Many segs

güzel oyun yani
"akhirnya setelah sekian lama menambahkan permainan ini kedalam daftar keinginan, saya dapat membelinya juga. sungguh ini merupakan hal yang membuat saya berbahagia..."
gud gaem
love it...
gta is an emotion
"Nice game, Homiee!"
Tis fun
"i like the - cars  - driving - action - 90s movie vibe - cinematic gameplay  - many vehicles that aren't cars - realistic, almost ""simulation"" vibe - feel of just free-roaming a city - witty sign puns - relatable things NPCs say - permission to be as nuts as you want - mild consequences - water physics - car physics - rain effects - environmental effects - realistic sounds: guns, explosions, insects, rain on the roof of your car - being able to smoke, drink, and eat snacks, with animations and measurable effects - feeling of accomplishment that comes with successful evasion of simulated law enforcement - stash houses - G's cache drops - casino freebies - train rides - weapons, explosives, etc - fashion options - customizable character (in online play) - option to play in a closed friend session - passive mode - fact that you can work as a taxi driver - fact that you can get away with literally anything as long as you are a taxi driver"
i get to bash hookers so 10/10 from me

Ran my friend over while doing the cayo heist
ITS GTA5
"this was sorta worth the 30€. not really because it's full with cheaters (found 3 cheaters in my 3rd lobby, got kicked 5 times in the next lobbies)"
"If you're gonna buy it, do it before they inevitably nerf Cayo Perico even more."
"Bang bang bang,bum bum bum"
best gameeeeee\
For teens not kdis.
Very fun to play and relaxing
game full of bugs but i like committing mass genocide

это офигенная игра рекомендую
it feels very much realistic.My one of dream's was to play this game
This is the fifth main instalment of the Grand Theft Auto Franchise
jhuhu
This is just a normal day in LA
"Story Mode Good, Online is a buggy mess play on console"
Still looks better than some recent AAA games. worth to buy on sale.
Amazing Best Game ever Till Date
the club is cool
"Absolutely shocking decisions by rockstar to force you to have a social club account to even play the story mode. Make sure you don't make the same mistake I did of playing ten years ago, linking to your steam account and then losing access to the social club account. You won't be able to use any rockstar games you purchased on steam and as usual the support by rockstar is complete trash"
CAUSE SKIBIDI TOLIUETR  RIZZZ
poopy poopy banana banana lap dance by stripper a baby tomorrow (btw my friend got a lap dance by a stripper he got her phone number and she never texted him back)
This game is easy to cheat on
It's the perfect video game
Controls are terrible and it's clear PC was an afterthought. Doesn't even support mouse button 5. Complete horse crap.
A moderator flung me he was mean :(
Accurate California Simulator
"There's a reason this game has held up for 10 years; it's because Rockstar knows how to craft a world and story like no other. The story mode is fantastic, it may not be the best story in the franchise, but the introduction of multiple protagonists to explore this, at the time, massive map, it was truly an awesome experience. The online is another beast entirely, going strong for almost 10 years is impressive. The online community is fairly toxic unless you have a friend group. That being said, it is still pretty fun to load an invite only server and raise your own mayhem."
after u pley a bit its the best but for the long run i still dont know
this game is so good because when i started playing this game i made a friend get it and now he loves it
oh yeah shoot cops and kill the ops (also you can get drunk and pass out and end up in a bathroom)
MY FAVORITE GAME!
"can steal cars, game is infact not misleading."

"I can say with 564% certainty this game is no longer worth playing. My reasons include, but are not limited to: ● Instead of focusing on removing hackers and improving the Online experience, Rockstar seems more keen on inflating costs and deflating profits (and, of course, their insatiable lust for selling Shark Cards). The amount of work that needs to be put in to getting the latest business or vehicle is extremely absurd and overinflated. You spend millions of in game dollars on a business that demands irl days worth of time dumped into it to turn a profit (and why does a mid SUV cost more than a literal super car?) ● Content disparity between current gen consoles and PC baffles me. It's one thing to have a game exclusively on one platform or console, but when the same game is missing features that you can only get on another platform? I am curious to their reasoning, but so far my money's on incompetence of their own code. One of my friends recently had to stop playing the game due to it bluescreening after about an hour of play since the Christmas update. He figured it was due to some sort of graphical overload due to the snow, but after the snow left the bluescreening stayed.  ● The constant disappointment that comes from features being added and never failing to come up short is a thing to behold. First-person GTA is something most-all players of the series have wanted for a very long time! Rockstar adds it, and the FOV is abyssal. Of course, mods can fix this glaring issue, but you have a very good chance of triggering their anti-cheat and getting your account nuked. Tow-trucks have been in the game since launch, and after 10 years they FINALLY added them! Buuuuut, it's locked behind a business and it can only be used on mission specific vehicles.  ● While it's nice the interaction menu got a face-lift recently, it's still clunky to navigate through. That, and while the controls felt good back when the game launched, are in desperate need of an overhaul. Mapping the functions of running, interacting, and answering your phone has lead to many instances of death, failure, and general annoyance (God forbid it's not an unskippable phone call). I don't care if you need your shoes or want a pizza, I'm in the middle of a literal war right now. Text me.  ● Lastly there is no Michael content for GTA Online, making it highly likely the Kill Michael option is the canon ending to GTA 5's story. There are plenty of places where Michael could have been ""the guy"" instead of this deluge of one-dimensional, quippy, tropey, uninspired characters that feel tacked on instead of interwoven. Instead of collaborating with Ned Luke (Michael's actor) for the 10th Anniversary of GTA 5, they just added a business. Meanwhile Ned is doing a play through of GTA 5 on his YT channel, I highly recommend checking it out sometime! TL;DR: Rockstar is greedy, incompetent, disappointing, lazy, Justice for Michael. Modders ruined the game, but at this point I hope they win. Fuck you Rockstar, see you in Vice City."

The single-player is a wonderful story that really makes you feel for these folks. However, the fact we never got single-player DLCs is criminal... eh? Hah! He he. But seriously, beat the missions and do the side stuff. You'll not regret it!   As for multiplayer, it's best to play it with friends and that is made far easier now that private lobbies have full progression now. Go to Invite Only and go nuts. There is a LOT in multiplayer. Missions, heists, businesses (legal and illegal), and a whole lot more. There's plenty to do in multiplayer that unfortunately completely overshadows single-player to an obscene degree. That aside, it's definitely worth playing now that you don't have to play public."

"After 10 years, the only problems that get fixed are things that are fun or profitable for people. The minor QoL changes and recent updates that just use the same tired formula are just indicative of a corporation trying to extract as much cash for this cow as possible. And the loading, HFS the LOADING?!?! in 2024?! Doesn't matter if you are on a SSD, you can do 1 mission and be stuck in an infinite loading screen. And then there's the actually unplayable content, so full of glitches that the most interesting part becomes ""Wow, I didn't know it could mess up like that"""
lopit
strp club
GTA Online are dead the players are few to play with and the loading time is fucking slow its's trash
Does not load tried everything f this game
"10+ years of amazing gameplay and memories with friends, Thank you Rockstar. <3"

Piece of shit game can't even get the basics right after 10 years. MOAR FLYING DUMP TRUCK PLS!
kook
Everything that Rockstar made in this game is amazing! Can't wait for GTA6 - Just wish there was less people cheating (PC) seems like there are so many cheaters lately and nothing happens to them. they are really annoying so I usually do join solo servers. Hopefully one day they all get banned.
its a great game its a must get
Its alr I wish the game was global updates instead of each platform having different ones.
Perfect!
"The game has quality and jokes but the story and graphics cant compete with red dead redemption 2, after playing this go try rdr2 out."

"ITS GTA, nuff said!"

"game is good, online is ass"
I got banned for absolutely no reason I want my refund
just waiting for gta 6

Timeless masterpiece.
"Trash mechanics. You may argue that its a 10 year old game.. but Halo CE original is 15 years old and the game has superb aiming and vehicle mechanics. GTA has slow, sloppy and has relativity unresponsive controls. understanding the basic physics of GTA you'll find that most things don't even follow those simple game physics. some tree you can run over no problem, some are invincible. the invincible trees have an unrealistic hit box and making the smallest branch or a leaf an indestructible monster. genuinely makes no sense how a triple A game company makes so many contradictions in their own game. the movement is trash as wall. trying to turn your character 90 degrees will make them run in a circle 5 times while running into every wall possible. seems the controls are purposefully delayed and sporadic for a worse experience.  its easier to talk to a special needs kid than it is to play this game."
"i love doing the cayo perico heist and then after beeing done with the heist i wil most likely run or fly straight to the strip club where the following steps happen 1. go up to the body guard and knock him out 2, go in and have a few shots 3, blow all my money to get the digits from the workers ;)"
i mean its gta5
"I absolutely love it. So many fun heists and mission to do, and I love just free roaming and having a good time with other players. But, the one thing i don't like is the amount of annoying players in the game that just go around shooting and killing people, but I guess you can't control that."
"Gta é gta, mas a versão online do Pc, está tomado por Modders. Não há chances de jogar em servidor público, sem haver ao menos um player explodindo a sessão inteira. Sinto que a Rockstar já abandonou faz tempo."
Just. Grind. Crates. Don't. Mod. Don't. Be. Dumb. Thanks.
eee
NOSTALGIC
"Absolutely not. Every single online server has cheaters. It's impossible to play. If I knew this was the state of this game, I'd never ever play it.   Thanks, Rockstar!"
sucks balls wont let me login
"It's gta, can't say anymore, R* never disappoints."
"Grand Theft Auto V, is in my opinion, the greatest open world video game ever."
Good game no cheaters
"Fun game , but be ready to grind."
very fun game highly recommend
easy ish to mod
dope
online is peak if your playing in a private server with your friends its so funny  also punching civilians is so funny
its aight.
very cool history
"Don't forget there's a story mode to this game, and it's actually quite good."

"Social club requrement: 0/10     (I appreciale good old times whan you can just play a game, w/o registering for some service you never need) Cenzorship: 0/10   (in first 5 minutes of this game about professional criminals I heard word ""fuck"" like million times. but somehow I'm not allowed to use this word in my social club account name. WHY?)  Game: can be ok, will see"
Story mode: good fun Online: yes
dont know why so many people car about a silly little car game
To me : I like Gta because his bugs are insane . and Playing Online with Friends gives a Very Good time

"fun community, and quick to pick up, fits all play styles"
"I kind of think I wasted my money a bit, the graphics seem artificially capped on this PC port, with the game looking better on my Xbox 360 from 15 years ago, when you open it through steam it asks you to provide personal information to a third party service (rockstar social club) which I found creepy as hell  The first game I had online was fun, there were normal people and it was about what I expected, the next day I played I was having a terrible time being chased from hospital to hospital by guys with tanks, or weird ass laser miniguns and jetpacks, depending on the session, and when I would leave the session I would get a ""bad sport"" message, I get the feeling there were bots to keep me playing and my personal experience wasn't great.  Overall it feels like it jumped the shark, if you like wild and wacky shit you might like it, if you want the story just buy an old console version."
dont play online unless you have a mod menu or youll hate yourself
very good game to say the least :)
"Very good game, loved since childhood, lowriders is cool."
incredible story with great characters.
"very good game, must buy fun to play with your friends."

Bought bundle and I’m having trouble getting the shark card and criminal enterprise. Any tips on how to get it to work
best since 2013
pretty good game nice shoe store
This a robbery
hooker
Gun go brrrrrrrrrr
"After playing this game for 10 years on various different platforms, i can't stand it."
hooker system is good
"Great Game to Mod, the required Social Club is very annoying, as it will forget the BS password it made you set at random intervals, then make you create some insane ""secure password"" that you can never remember, because you never use it, and of course the auto fill for the silly worthless password in Google wont copy in game, my damn PC knows the password, but Rockstar disables the feature as some stupid copy protection.  This is a STEAM game, I PAID for it, created your WORTHLESS account, stop requiring a fresh login to a service I never use..............."
Best game you can ever buy
its gtav what can i say most fun with some good mods
"game is good online makes you get hacks to deal with the hacks. otherwise you can't have any peace in online mode. everyone is a hacker like 8/10 of them so you and one other will be complaining while the rest are like ""whaaat? on pc? no way."" when yeah. i don't think people these's days understand how shitty hackers really are."
This game actually taught me ethical lessons haha
Gran Thef
only fun thing to do is blow stuff up
Very good game one should play before gta 6 realeses
grand theft auto has been such a good experience and i have enjoyed playing it with friends and other but the only thing i have that i kinda don't like is all the modders but other then that its a amazing game and i do recommend it for others to play
lots of things to do a buy also 420 hours ;)
good but theres a lot of modders and its stupid easy to be one
I may be new but this games is my favorite
you can go hunting

"they can't keep giving free updates, there is just too much to do"
"Good game, doesnt feel like it was released in 2013. Holds up pretty well till today."
great game cant wai tfor gta 6
the game is fun i stole a lot of tanks

"The game has crashed multiple times and doesn't even run steadily for 30 min on a brand-new gaming laptop. Every other game, I have no issues whatsoever."

Goooooood game!
I have lost all my money in the club

"Honestly some parts of the game is fun, like messing around with some buddies. All the modders and shit make life horrible in some lobbies or just unsafe to be in. So remember, always play with a VPN on"

this game is lit af
i like it
Not for under 18
"I am so hyped for GTA 6!!! I will remember this game because I encountered someone from the ""gooner squad"". They are dressed in pink clothing and driving around los santos with the same anime car. I hope more people will get banned doing those kinds of actions in game."
"You forget a thousand things everyday pal, how about you make sure this is one of them."

"For mine 135 hours playing this game, i feel the need to come here and say that this game is perfect. The game has fast and slow cars and that are very customization able. Houses and penthouses are nice and you can customize them to. There are missions, and heist. Guns that you can upgrade and make them have diffrent colors, ECT. There are places your able to go inside of. You can buy night clubs, counterfeit money places, cocaine place, weed farm were you can get supply's and then sell them for money. Over all this game is very gun and unique in its own way."
"Absolutely absurd that they labeled PC as ""last gen"" and dropped the game on here. PC literally invented ray tracing... but no, the devs abandoned it and moved to stupid console development only. Even GTA 6 wont be on PC at launch. Hope rockstar enjoys how horrible they are making their company look."
Drugs yum
MY BROTHER SHOULD GET THIS GAME
I can punch women :)
I hope you have a million dollars to spend on money in game to buy weapons because if you don't some guy with a flying motorcycle is gonna launch nukes at you until you leave the lobby.
it good ngl

"Do not buy shark cards to support GTA 6, Rockstar has 22b they can pay for it themselves first.  Never spent any money on shark cards but the storys amazing and onlines a dumpster fire and only fun in invite only lobbies."
"Honestly, I was in love with GTA Vice City. Back around 2004 it was my favorite game and I still retain warm memories of playing it. Vice City seemed to have been bustling with activities and you could always find something to do.  GTA5? A whole 'nother story for me. Don't get me wrong, the story itself is rather good... But it offers nothing else besides it. It doesn't give you -- or does a very poor job of pointing at -- interesting and meaningful side activities. I found nothing interested to do apart from doing the main story. I'm not interested in yoga and tennis, I want to explore the city, find interesting stuff while I'm doing it and experience interesting game mechanics. Most of it seem to be in the story. I personally didn't find the same enjoyment and diversity I saw in Vice City. In fact, it seems like a lot of features from Vice City were either not present in GTA V or rearranged, turning them into optional and utterly boring side activity.   Another gripe for me was Online. I'm not interested in GTA Online, but it's still included with the main game. I guess no point complaining about this, since removing it is unlikely to massively change the disk size.  All in all, if you liked GTA only for the story, then feel free to buy it with a discount. If you want something more for your experience, then you'd rather play the Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2. Especially the latter. It has all the vibes of GTA but with more diversity, more gameplay, more fun, more side activities, it's just much much better.   Hopefully Rockstar takes RDR2 experience into consideration for GTA6"
Ive always liked this game
i like vanilla
awdawda
great for stress
"The game is quite interesting as a concept (free world), but badly executed and is example of how world should not look like. Let me give you examples: - There is too much unnecessery cursing. It is just annoying to say the least. Yes there could be some from time to time, but this is just too much.  - Crime is glorified and really it should not be. It would be better for main characters to fight crime not cause it.  - There is no point for Russian language and culture to be part of the game as the game is made in America.  - Too less legal activities (opening business and managing it, be part of striving for success)  I don't think this game is suitable for anyone, because it makes you do innapropriote things in worst way possible.  And it is not suitable for younger people especially not to make impression that world consists only of crime.  Yes - you may say - well this is game and in game you should do something that you would not do in real life, but this is too much violence. There are also legal and interesting things to explore that you would not do in real life. Like building a software company or something.   I hope that GTA 6 would be at least a bit better, because this is dissapointment to be honest."
GOOD VIOLWNT GAME
Its Gta who tf wouldn't reccomend it
awful game
aaaa
Very loong loading screen for online and shitty rockstar launcher. Not worth the trouble with all their shitty security and shitty servers to play a shitty game
"Love the singleplayer. Used to love online, until they overdid it."

Yes indeed i would recommend this game. but not in 2025 because gta6 will be out but still this game is just perfect in my opinion

amazing with mods
"One of the best games ever made. There is so much happening in Los Santos, you don't get this level of immersion in many games. Highly recommend.  GTA online is great as well, I wouldn't recommend playing in open sessions though."
"I really love this game, cant wait them to release the GTA VI"
"Played a few minutes, kept getting stuck at the same spot and couldn't figure out how to progress further and gave up. Left a very bad taste. Will never play again. Had many friends who loved this game, but I am not one of them.  As for a recommendation, I don't recommend anything ... games, foods or Amazon products to anyone."
"My friend who I play CS 2 with said if I post a review on wallpaper engine , and it gets 800 likes and 350 Awards then he will buy me a RTX 3060 and 1 Kilo of Lemon . So im just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha"

i dislike about the game is that you cant get pulled over by police like say you went past a red light and police catch you they need to pull you over so i think you need to add that police can pull you over wen you do something wrong
bast game
story mode is fun with mods
good game with a lot to do and a lot of fun fings to do
"I love the freedom of just move around, doing whatever you feel like. One does not even have to play the game, but just go on roving from time to time."

"-Loads into a Session -Get killed by some Dude who shot me with a Fast Asf Snowball Launcher after walking around for 5 seconds Great game, would recommend (There are a lot of Modders in the game)"
"GTA V is a very fun game. I am visually impaired, and while some parts are more difficult than others, I usually find a solution. I love the mods that the community makes, especially since some of them greatly help me with inavvessible sections. Trust me and buy the game."
I love GTA
I LIKET
"I love this game some much. I must have played it about more than 100 hrs. Just started playing the game again after 3 years (PS3 and 4) away and it's just as good as I remember HOWEVER! I paid $10 for steam plus just to play online and what a waste, won't even bother since it's just littered with unaffordable dlc. Thinking back, I used to spend my time in a private lobby on online back in the day to avoid the bad players. The online could be amazing if it went back to full lobbies for heists/jobs and when the new car out was 500k and not 2 million.  It's sad that they've gotten greedy and are holding back gta 6 because online earns so much. So until then it's play story again and just enjoy the freedom but you can't modify cars and insure them which is the only downside."
one of the best game of my life

"honestly disappointing, generally a fun game but completely ruined by cheaters and modders online. Rockstar truly does not give a shit about their games and only care about money clearly because any sort of money cheats they immediately catch on to protect their profit margins but any other kind of cheating or modding is completely overlooked because it doesn't affect profit. These modders basically have admin powers that you would see on gmod servers in gta online. They can spawn anything, kill anyone, trap you, and boot you from the game. They basically have god powers on any server and rockstar does jack shit. They let their game rot because its still pumping out money. And thats just the game side. Rockstar themselves makes this game an endless grind through repetitive missions, missions that are literally the same as the story mode missions with even the same animations or models used. And you have to do those missions over and over to grind through level after level and slowly gain minuscule amounts of cash compared to the cost of literally anything in this game. They ask for the price of most top dollar games and then proceed to use the predatory tactics to milk even more money out of you. Rockstar is milking the game for everything its got with no regard for the people who play it."

"I know this is an old game, but it doesn't matter. This issue is timeless. The menu controls like a sloppy, drunk, wet cow that you're trying to control with your mind. It's absolutely abysmal.  Furthermore, let's say that you don't want to use WASD keybinds from 1990 and instead you want to use ESDF keybinds that actually make sense... well, good luck. You'll find yourself constantly running into conflicts.  Worse, if you decide like me, that I don't care about online and I just want to play the story mode, well, I'll just unbind some useless ""online only"" keybinds, right? No, no you won't. The garbage game will complain that you have keybinds unbound. You say ""yes, I know, still save."" Does it save your keybinds? No. You have to go back into the keybinds and bind every single useless keybind that you will never use because the developers are lazy and useless.  Even simple things like clicking on a graphics setting and trying to change it. It feels like I need to use telepathy to change or do anything. It runs and operates so incredibly poorly.  I hope this garbage isn't a sign of things to come for GTA VI."
its good.....
Rockstar doesn't care about the cheating in this game. Every lobby you join you gotta worry about damn modders fucking your shit up. The only way to not get fucked is to download cheats so you don't get fucked with every damn lobby.
AMAZING I GOT A SHIT PC AND IT RUNS AT 62 FPS  THANKS ROCKSTAR

"Recommend, You can just play with any ages you want unless your parent policies."
"Definitely this game is epic. But don't buy it at Rockstar Games cause it cost a lot how about steam with discount Student also can pay up. With the GTAV and GTAOL you can play a lot such as missions, racing and whatever. For me this game is pretty worth it for me."

"Would not recommend. The game experience is completely ruined by modders CONSTANTLY!!! The modders can do just about anything except give you money, but dont worry rockstar has shark cards to sell you."
"DIS GAME GOOD, HAVE OVER 1,200 HOURS ON CONSOLE"
Great story
Very good if sad
love this rockstar great job
its fun!
"GTA is honestly iconic and although Rockstar has been milking Online for money over the past couple of years, the content that was available at launch and the content that was added over the years alone makes this game worth the $30 price point. Although I got bored of online after about 100 something hours, I still need to go back and fully complete the story mode because the progression and the missions never seem to bore me. The fact that you can switch between Micheal, Trevor, and Franklin throughout the story make it all the more interesting as their personalities are very different from one another and playing different missions with each character feels more memorable rather than if you were confined to a single character. Although I am not the biggest GTA fan to this day, I have to admit that it was one of the most impressive games released in the 2010s, and the fact that they continue to have a stable player base to this day means that they have made something incredible. Not sure how I feel about GTA VI yet, but GTA V will always stick with me as I grew up playing it."
"the game is just so unique overall the story mode has its downs and sad parts, but besides all of that its although very good but the price is very pricey"
very fun but the people online are meanies lol
i blow up a nice granny and her grand-kids down the street i spawned in at.
Intrusive Thoughts Simulator.
"no rewie needed, bro its GTA5"
Exceptional story telling.
giggity giggity giggity giggity
it is the best game by far
its really good and still good from this day
i like blow up people with jet :)
If you a GTA fan you'll love it.
It took a long time for my boy friend to get me to pay for GTA V. I bought it because it was on sale and it is alright graphics are better than expect for such an old game. The most fun is playing with mod gamers and they give you money or levels or kill you continuously until you quit the entire game because you can't stay alive long enough to switch servers.
drogas molieres
yesssss
"too many hackers, terrible fps and crazy amounts of lag, not only that but you need to be a billionaire to buy half the things, 2+ million for a go kart doesnt justify the price just because its new..."
For an old game this is still a strong and fun game! If youre waiting for 6 to drop and are wondering if you should give this a try? Then the answer is yes. This is a great game even though it is almost 9 years old.
"there is always something new to do in this game, chances are, if you've finished this game. there's still more to do. not to mention its fun as all heck"
Fun fun fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good game recommend for kids under 5

its fun as long as you play offline with lots of money or if you play online get your own sever so you dont get killed
"A la 512, chica, dile a tu novio que salga del closet A veces bebe tinto, a veces bebe Rosé Borracha toíta' canta ""No Me Conoce"" Yo sé que no tiene gato hace par Lo que quiere e' bellaqueo, en la playa de Ocean Park Tiene el flow medio retro, a veces usa Vans Tiene par de envidiosa', pero no se la dan Las botellas bajando, la nota subiendo Ella mueve ese culo pa' ver quién la 'tá viendo El trago le llega sin estarlo' pidiendo Muchos hablando mierda y mucha mierda comiendo La noche está pa' pasto y pelea, no juega pelota pero pichea No vende droga', pero to'a el flow se lo capean Se hizo la dentadura, ni el sol se la blanquea La baby siempre linda, nunca fea Eso e' normal, eso e' rutina Dice que la' má', a veces son la' má' fina' Échale premium, le gusta la gasolina Fuma y se pone china, me caso si ♥♥♥♥♥♥ como cocina"
the game itself is probably the best ever created but the people who play it? Are NOT the best.

"offline,story line classic online,multiplayer bad but if u download programs like fivem or ragemp to play roleplay you will waste your life to get rich in a game to be poor in real life, There is a high probability that you will become addicted, OK, just kidding, a recommendation from me"
I love to go to the strip club and get freaky
ballsack
very entertaining
es fun with mods
Every single game you play in online will have hackers or modders in it.
this game is gta
"trjnxs crdjnbv ndrem,b4e"
love the game just dont favor the hackers that cheat and steal your info
this shit is ass
GREat game peepee
gta  6 is coming babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 2025
"good story mode, come back to replay every now and then. havent touched online in years and probably wont ever again, have the same community service guidelines as 2K it seems"

pretty sweet
realy good game to play with your friends
gooooooooooooooooood game.
"The game is no longer fun to play. Online servers are full of hackers that will destroy your experience. In addition to this, the game crashes when you're in the middle of long and hard missions, leaving hours of work in the dust."
FIRE IN THE HOLE 🔥🔥🔥
good gmae
i like carrots
i dont need to explain.
A fun game.
Love the aspect of being able to mod this game. Would recommend to anyone who is looking to take their GTA V experience to the next level.
"I don't have words to describe this game, it's one game who i don't understand how this game was maked on 2013 so for me it's very good and if you don't have friends you can play only because the story mode is very very good and with friends it is more fun!!"
Good game but if i unalive andyone they will drop big money stack but you only get like 11 dollars
"I'm voting this down because I have no space on my laptop to install another big game and that's partly due to GTA Online hijacking 55.9 GB of precious SSD space for no reason whatsoever. Simply deleting the dlcpacks folder will cause certain issues in story mode, so I'm not keen to do that. I guess it was beyond your knowledge and resources to make GTA Online a separate download like so many games on Steam. It puts me off replaying the game, so after installing it and not playing it for months I'm just going to uninstall it, again. I hear that's really good for the environment.  This might come as a shock to you, Rockstar Games, but not everyone is interested in GTA Online. I mean, it's a possibility that they're not even remotely curious about it. When I look at the Hardware & Software Survey for Free Hard Drive Space, I'm shocked by the amount of free space most people have, so in that sense you're in the right, but you're also not the only 100+ GB pony out there. People are making guides to trim down oversized installs on Steam, be it unnecessary language files, online content or whatever. You're probably going to repeat this with GTA VI and nothing I say or do will change that because you don't care. Why should you, right? You've made $8.5 billion off this game. Writing this is about as useful as telling Bezos to stop being a greedy inhumane asshole."

GTA V is one of those timeless games that most everyone remembers fondly. Game is very versatile and Rockstar is a legendary game developer. What more can you ask for!

a very fun game i played it on ps3 and now i bought it on pc( PS: the pc versions is full of modders :)) some friendly but some are not)
I thought it would be old and dated but it still holds up!
game is good
"One of the best game of 201x, so many things to do in online, recommend"
"The Story mode is thrilling and teaches a lot, and Online is very entertaining with friends, and some sessions even if you have no friends. The biggest drawback is surely the exploiters."
its very cool to play
Fun story.
awsome game
Second best gta right next to san andreas
"""some of the government is corrupt"" 😲"
i love staring at the online loading screen
You'll have to do cayo perico heist eventually if your grinding... many... MANY... times...
tiss good
"I hate it but it's really fun, just buy it for the main story, don't fall into the abyssal spiral of the online grind (unless you wanna play with friends?)"
very god game
relly fun game
Very fun free roam and online. Graphics are amazing.
I love this game! Naturally this is the most iconic game of the 21st century! I would like to point out the top story! Very cool game!
Getting screwed by aimbot AI 10/10 will play again
An incredible game
"Great, but a sickening number of cheaters"
"For those who don't have time for grinding, or prefer not to be blown up into pieces and being reassembled back by cheating fucks, or feel caged like a struggling monkey jumping and shaking vigorously trying to get out. Do not get GTA Online. Thank you."
very gud gaem
LSPDFR is the best

Grand Theft Auto V:  I was wrong all along. This game is fun. You should buy it!  At a glance: ?/100 ______________________________________________________________________ Graphics:__________Cool Gameplay__________We make money and we steal!

Story_____________You character your story Game Time________70 Hours so far! Price_____________Get it cheap! Bugs_____________Some. Nothing too bad. Verdict____________I RECOMMEND THIS ONE  Sincerely Bromst0ne
SO MANY MODER AND CHEATER IN ONLINE MATCH AND ROCKSTAR DONT EVEN CARE REALLY BAD
"Recommend just singleplayer, multiplayer have big problem. Just bugs and dosen't work"
the game is dope as fu#k.
"Just a joke, you can sort of pretend that it's a game if you stick to the online version and practically imagine that there is a game but for Story Mode (so the soul of a GTA) is just a dump of random assets in the form of a city with a couple of half-backed cutscenes.  This is one of those games that you can use to determine the intelligence of a person. Do they like it? They probably also believe in horoscopes and preorder every single AAA games they can.  Bad controls, bad gameplay, offensively stupid UX and UI, a story that is a waste of time, soul-less characters, stroke-inducing mechanics and so on."
i would recomend this game to people who like to play racing games+ shooting games people who mod and exploit the game are always getting banned but some times you run into them other wise the game is brilliant and the majority of the time you will be to busy to notice people using mods/exploits there are a lot of fun and entertaining things to do like jobs and missions races. etc ...
"Play the game ethically, morally, and legally and you should be good. Also, play on invite only servers the online players are toxic."
"game is trash. flying donkey motorcycles blowing me up all the time. rolling in cash in online so i can actually get things done but other than that youre pretty much fucked. story is nice, franklin is pretty chill. michael is a fat old white guy. trevor is relatable. 8/10."
"It's a game, I guess"
Bungle Dungle  Fungle Shungle
"Love everything about it, although I'm a bit distraught that I am unable to drive a locomotive."
"Definitely the biggest game and best game for its time. Best part are the heists. The satisfaction everytime you come back home from an epic bank robbery is crazzy. Whether it be booking it from the popo down the highway, pulling off an epic motorcycle stunt off the side of Mount Chilliad, or beating up some poor fella who commented on Trevors hairline, GTA V will forever be one of, if not the greatest game rockstar has ever made. (RDR2 is outstanding too tho)"

nothing to say i love it too much buy this game it is the best game on steam rn (in my opinion)

"graphichs 10/10 gameplay 10/10 story 9/10 online 10/10  cops 9/10 (anoying) missions 10/10 cars 10/10 guns 10/10 customisation (chlotes, tunning) 9/10 (expensive) ways to make money 7/10 (hard) npcs 8/10 (anoying) price 8/10  not worth the full price, only discounted  (i paid 15$)  total 9/10 ( i recommend this game )"
nc game
"Everything is expensive now, they nerf heists all the time, lots of hackers and some of them can even enter your private session like it happened yesterday and all Rockstar cares is about patching money glitches, not about fixing the random crashings, banning the hackers, fixing heist bugs that can fck your 2/3 hour planned heist or anything useful, there was a time when GTA V was enjoyable back in the 360 days but now? If you can ignore all the problems or you if you just want storymode/fivem, maybe."
i liked it cus i drive
"If you like to shoot people, do missions, run around, drive cars, explode things with your bare hands, or explode things in general, this game is for you dawg."

GAME IS GAME
What can you expect from  GTA 5 ?: 1. Funny unmature kids pull your IP 2. 1v1 against god mode  3. 3h work = 1 car (excluding upgrades ofc )  4. Deliveries ? Garenteed death and loss   Hope you have fun
takes too long
really fun
"This game is really good, i spend a lot of time playing this game even tho i suck at some of the missions lol."
still one of the best game so far its been years playing and you still can do so much more
I loving the story mode and yeah its worth the money from the setting to the story its really good.
always stuck in loading screen lol also cant request cars sometimes it
who doesn't like gta v
"Griefers, Modders and Hackers are pretty common thing you'd find if you play in public lobby. There's invite only lobby where you can play alone but that kinda defeat the purpose of playing online and trying to play with other people.  There''s also the problem for players like me who play GTA Online every once in a while, which is the way rockstar keeps nerfing the in-game monetary rewards from heists like the Cayo Perico and the Payphone hit. Making saving money to buy stuff you want/need keeps getting longer and longer."
niceeeeee
MODDED TO HELL!!!!!!
In 52h playtime i have only encountered 1 bad hacker so i'd say this game on pc is worth it.
i liked trevor
nice gameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
gjjh

Shitgame
"There is no anti-cheat and it's full of hackers. You will get spawn camped by people who make themselves invisible, have random cars dropped on top of you, have your vehicle dragged to the top of maze bank, and get spammed with loud noises. This will happen 90% of lobbies."
Rock Star is stupid i lost my email and i need my emial to fix that Its so dumb
Really good kid friendly game
story mode is fun
turns out there's more than just a strip club in this game.
Great anticheat!
Best game in history
you cant have sex with another man
dont buy it unless youre a neo-nazi cause this is the place for you to flaunt racism ALSO ROCKSTAR LET ME PLAY THE GAME I GOT SOME MFING .XYZ EMAIL SIGNED INTO MY STEAM ACCOUNT?!!?!?!?!?!?!?!
"GTA 5, the single player campaign is absolutely amazing.  GTA Online, is a cesspool of cheaters, little kids, and sweaty tryhards. nevertheless i still have over 1000 hours in it but that's just because I'm insane and enjoy grinding for ungodly amounts of time for a crappy overpriced car. Just please don't buy shark cards."
i love trevor phillips
i love it umhaaaaaaaaa
best part is online & worst part be

"One of the biggest games in the industry for a reason. There's plenty to do, even though it shows I played 3 hours on Steam, I also played it on other platforms for years with my brother, it's super fun."
it's fun committing mass murder in this game. 10/1
yes i do recommend this game is sooo cool and fun when i am bored i play this game and i am unbored
I just drive cars and shoot people.
"Best game ever, i'm very excited for gta 6"
i got murdered by cops too many times
Good game gambling is fun (I am not addicted you are).
"This is a very good game if you love taking your anger out on game NPC'S but cant kill them.  but in gta, you can kill them.  also its fun"
"Online is full of modders and cheaters, r* does not care about it anymore but i hope it will be fixed in gta vi"
ljmgm
meth!
"Probably my favorite franchise since I GTA3.. love this game played for for 10 years on console but I cannot recommend this game on pc. Story? Yes. Online? Hackers, everywhere. Can't even contend with them like on consoles.. ruins every aspect of the game. Forces you to play in single lobbies if you want to get anything done. Rockstar sadly doesn't care about GTA Online for PC and it shows."
Best game cant wait for GTA 6!!!!!!!
this is a good game a fun
great game waiting for 6
it´s nice
ijl
ITS FUN :D
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD

Franklin needs a new cut.
Psychopath simulator the game
its really fun if u have friends to play with
Addicting! But online public lobbies at this time are pillaged by cheating/modding. I play mostly solo.
The fact that I can't play on the account I started with because A multi-million dollar company doesnt want to handle account transfers is wild
very barry good
"[h1]""Surviving Is Winning, Franklin!""[/h1]"
bad (too expensive)
good story imo and its also just fun to mod/mess around in
Promotes Violence and Hate.  10/10

"Got spawned killed by a hacker 27 times in a row, definitely recommend!"
fuck faggots
lowlife hackers/modrs ruin this game online if you want this game for the story buy it if you want to play online i would think twice about purchasing.
i can beat hookers so i see this a total win
"I liked everything, it's GTA 5 what are you supposed to not like about the game I mean sure there aren't a lot of buildings to go inside but the next gta as the trailer seems good is that there will be more explorable buildings so just wait I'm sure the next gta will be so good you will forget the other ones even existed"
great game but since im on laptop it lags and crashes my game a lot i cant enjoy it
who doesnt like this game be fr
"Крутая игра. Проверял план по ограблению банка, теперь я на Мальдивах."

Awesome. First time playing GTA 5
its gta 5. Like if you havent played it what are you doing with your life at this point
Nice game. Loved the Online Edition. Enjoyable with Friends!!!!
PC has been left behind to the point they can't spawn a deer in order to get a new car added. Yet still happily take your money for shark cards. Been an okay 8 years but time to move on.
Very god game you need to buy it

"If your coming for GTA online, too many hackers, this game is abandoned.  Consoles get all the content and new features.  Hackers will adjust your level randomly, tele to you and kill you, do various things.  Stay away, hopefully GTA 6 we see some sort of fixes/anti-cheat but doubt it."
ASOME
i orginaly played the game on ps4/5 and xbox360/one i love the gta game serise and hope you will too
Theres no sex where i could see anything good. They need to add realistic sex. what ya think?
It's GTA 5 innit? Not much I can say that hasn't already been said.
fun and never gets boring
cars
lmao let me play the damn single player game without signing in to this dumb social club crap.
I always run over the motor cycelests. why the fuck are you on the road just drive a damn car or else your gonna get run over by me on purpose.
"It's GTA , isn't that enough to say?"
easy
I was told this game would make me into a murderer. I was already one before so win win? Anyways I recommend 11/10
this is very good game
Kacper is my baby boy and I wanna make out with him :)
great game but no sex with lester
the best game
good game but    not  good  like ps2 gta  games      and i not  like online
bdbdszhrhetwtrg
I really like playing in gta because it's like a reality world
Kosatka go BRRRRR
dwdwdw
the best gta - gameplay wise so far
Nobody is actually playing this game anymore. Everyone has god mode on and does nothing but grief players. No actual money to be made in game unless you have 3 other actual players and a decent chunk of real money to throw at the game. Online sessions are seemingly impossible to even get into at this point.
first you play then you realize
Audio cuts off after a few secs of launching. Tried tons of fixes. Nothing works.
BOOB
GTA 6 waiting lobby
The game is a great game but it's really buggy on pc and sometimes the ground and environment disappears any help?
very addictive
i neeeeeeeeeeeeeed money
"good entertaining game for the family, they enjoyed it."
Starting to improve from 2021 and above.
PLAY IT
good game considering its an open world game where you can do a lot of stuff
Its fun but some of the online glitches piss me off like the Casino Mantrap glitch when it kicks you for no reason.
gta online is great
Very Good game (offline mode)  but the Rockstar Launcher is just useless

THIS GAME IS THE BEST
shoe store only reason why I play
This game doesn't need any review my advice is just don't get into Role-Play you will meet bunch of e daters and kids who think that they own the whole community after they become an admin on any servers.
УРАААААААААА КРУТО И хуево

Very Good Game Perfect
"Not a bad game, lost access to my rockstar account but apparently can't create a new one and play as you've allowed no way for us to reassociate our steam purchase with a new rockstar account. So i guess i can never play GTA V again. Fairwell Rockstar games"
Jogo muito bom

You get to become a Police officer with the LSPDFR mod and you get to roleplay with your friends in private servers!

"I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments, big and small, that make San Andreas – the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas – feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well-realised world and tells a story that’s gripping, thrilling, and darkly comic."
GTA is one of the best game I've been played since I was a child.
its gta5!
game fun but rockstar needs to fix the glitch where the snow in the winter event makes me beat my children
FANTASTIC

"I only recommend the single player, Online is out-dated and simple things like playing with friends is overly complicated and rife with issues. Online is a money pit, constantly begging for more shark cards to be able to do the content you want to do.  I originally played on console when it came out and the game then was a solid 8 or 9 outta 10 ( had over 300 hours on xbox 360 and xbox 1). Now i would rate single player as a 8 and Online as a 5.  just wait for Gta 6 if you want to play with friends. Its just not ""IT"" anymore and its FILLED with hackers who just want to ruin everyone's day. sad state to come back to this game in tbh"
be yopo
the freen4ess i feel while playing the game
Been playing this game off and on for years it's one of the best games for online play
A good classic
crime is fun :-)
very fun. the strip clubs make my pp hard
AWESOME
good game very good graphics and overall very fun

"An actual security risk to play online, since Hackers can literally nab your IP address, since R* built in direct IP connections to one another through GTAO.  SP is fine to play (if you're a proper nobody with no online following/streaming career) and MP is better left to be played solely in private lobbies with friends, or with a VPN."

"So tired of these morons leaving PC out. Never have consoles and PC's been so alike. Yet here we are, still don't have the most basic of things that have the potential to make them MILLIONS more like GTA+. And this week is the final straw. We wait 10 years to get police and emergency vehicles and the pieces of garbage make the weekly challenge to take pictures of animals. So PC can't even get it. I cannot fathom to stupidity of the people working at Rockstar. And how, TakeTwo the never-ending money printer and all around consumer-haters even allow this to happen.   Mark my words, we won't even get GTA-6. Ever. I only hope all of you use your brains and do not give them your money so they can see what they're going to lose out on."
Great game. Not for those who don't want to grind games.

Im a regular player who started in 2020 and now a days i was testing a mod menu for the first time and after 5 days i got temp banned and my account is getting reset with all the shark cards i have bought but my friends who have used mod menus and got millions of dollars in game and didnt get in trouble but I get i think that is unfair and also i should have been reseted to the levels I was at before and my cars I had before that shouldn´t be toucht
chinese hackers everywhere
I love this game. I have put in over a 1000 hours on console. It is a great experience most people are friendly and you can download fivem for a whole new experience. Over all great .

how do i gift things
Shark Cards
I suck in heist so i find a cheater to help me in 100%cut
game is good but the strippers are not it blud
I shot up every last person in the game and I shot down 91 helicopters!
"Too many hackers, modders and grievers in public lobbies to be enjoyable.. Rockstar doesn't care about anything other than money and I'm tired of their company and their playerbase making their games unplayable.  Rockstar can go bankrupt for all I care, I'm not buying anything else from them and GTA6 will never be on my wish list; I'd rather boycott Rockstar games from this point on!"
W game. I was really not looking to purchase but I am happy I did.
spent 161 hours playing with myself
a little nostalgia with my old pc
GTA V was an instant classic upon release and time has not yet diminished the glory of Rockstar's flagship product.
It is a fun game play and has nothing wrong with it but the only problem is that there are hackers  just wont let you progress. Everytime i go to sell my stock ppl teleport to me and blow up my vehicle or if they fail they teleport back in front of the vehicle and try again until i die. Until this issue is better resolved im take my leave.
Will continue to play even after the release of GTA 6. The damn game has a lot of memories with friends.
s<a
but it crashing often
fun game. good graphics. hotel. trivago.
Maybe you'll get rid of that yee yee ass haircut.
made me cum all over
very fun open world game 10/10
so cool
Another great installment in the GTA series. It has everything that makes a GTA game fun and executes on them perfectly. The addition of multiple characters that you can switch through was a nice touch that i hope keep with GTAVI.
trash dont mod even in story mode
This was a waste of my good money. You can't even level up playing at the Casino without players you have not interacted with taking shots at the character. This GTA 5 online version is essentially a gang-stalking platform. You can't enjoy leveling up without interference from other players. Some people just want the A.i. interaction expansion online version. Not the threatening chats out of nowhere. The nonsense of so-called high level players stalking a level 4 who has not used my paid for business tycoon pack as of yet. BS
the only time its legal to run over old people
its so good i love it
"Listen, I love this game, but its over run with modders and griefers, the game crashes constantly because everyone is trying to turn gta online into their own personal mod sandbox and constantly crash the session for everyone else. The game takes a VERY long time to boot up so getting crashed out every hour makes it hard to justify playing the game. Today I've played for about 3 hours and havent been able to accomplish anything because i always crash about 75% of the way into an hour long task and then back to square one.   I know GTA6 is almost out but Rockstar should do something about this chaos, it makes the game hard to enjoy"
"gta is fun u guys should try, but it takes up 50-100 gb of storage, so make sure when you guys this game, make sure to read my review"
s**t game dosen't accept my activation code so now  i can't play it smh
Best game since it was released!
It's GTA
A game made by Rockstar. What else do you need?
its awsome
Every time she's mad just f😩ck attitude out of her😈
"As a real life pilot, GTAV can be used as a great tool to practice, real world procedures, navigation, and communications. While the base game may not come with the best models for airliners, and will require you to purchase 3rd party addons to enjoy a realistic airline world, the popular Cessna 172 comes very close to what I fly in the real world. Combining the realistic Cessna with the beautiful scenery GTAV provides, and a 3rd party addon for ATC communications, like PilotEdge or VATSIM, I can create a very realistic feeling with the simulator. If I every fly an unfamiliar route in the real world, I can practice it in the sim first to get familiar with the sights I will see when I really fly, I can practice real world approaches, as well as other instrument procedures. Because the actual feeling of flying is hard to replicate, I strictly do not use the simulator to practice technique as it could create bad habbits for the real world, however while this may be true, I can still practice working procedures, and task management which sets a great foundation for myself when I return to the real cockpit!"
i liked michaels nuts
GTA 5 BEFORE GTA 6 IS CRAZY
"It's a great game, but unfortunately the online portion is rife with hackers and cheaters. Still a fun time, and invite only/friend only sessions are usually the way to go if the cheaters get too insane."

Playing this game for the first time ever... wish me luck.

No need to check anything just buy it if you get a good deal like under 12 to 18 dollars. GTA V has a fantasy of its own.

If you like GTA games this is a must play!
Cons:  * Unbalanced (there are items/vehicles that are OP) * P2W (people just spend real money to get ingame money and buy those OP vehicles/items) * A LOT of cheaters (you will encounter at least 1 in most online sessions)  Pros: * A lot of content * You can run over people with your cool ride * It's hell-a fun even 30 years after release

its ok i dont know how too buy shark cards on steam though
"Cannot play the game because I used to have my steam account under an old (now dead and inaccessible) email address. They will not let me play the game on this steam account because I changed it. Leading to one of the most insanely stupid things I've ever seen. This effectively means that because I changed my Steam email, I'm permanently banned from Rockstar due to this insanely stupid oversight on their part. Or as I see it, they forced me to boycott them. After all, why would I ever purchase games that I'm not allowed to play?"

They scrapped single player dlc to support their garbage online mode that hasn't been fun since 2014. Keep buying virtual money guys!!!!!
Everything is perfect
uga buga
"*Choosing to mod/cheat an online game with PvP = tiny pp energy* TL;DR: For the price, the single player alone is makes the purchase worth it. If you wish to play online you'll have an great time as long as you're careful in public sessions and keep your grinding in private sessions. If you're a car fan and enjoy shooters like me, this game is awesome. The online DLC has been consistently awesome however Rockstar cannot be bothered to implement anti-cheat. Console players enjoy a cheater-free experience as well as a few more features simply because they're more profitable. Pro-tip for NVIDIA owners at the end of this review :)  I decided to purchase this game in 2021 because I never actually played the single player and ended up spending close to 200 hours in it. The story of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor is second to none. This story and its game play is so good that it secured quite the profits for R* in the beginning: this game is the single most profitable piece of entertainment in human history. I'm personally very glad that the death wish ending is the canon ending, as evidenced by the events of GTA online. I absolutely love the default controls and how this game can seamlessly switch between my keyboard & mouse to my Dualsense controller. As an aviation nerd, the attention to detail when it comes to flying is incredible!!   While the single player helped R* make record-breaking profits in the beginning, it is the online component that kept this game profitable month after month and year after year to the tune of millions of dollars per month on average. Shark cards have been selling like hot cakes for the better part of an entire decade. Personally, I've never bought any shark cards and despise online cheating so 1,800 hours later my character has EARNED well over $665mil and over 6mil RP all while maintaining a K/D of 2.1. I have mastered the grind of consistently earning money and RP with most sessions netting me over 2mil. Out of principle, I refused to buy shark cards because R* REFUSES to do anything to remedy the cheater epidemic that is present in this game. The modding scene has gotten so profitable that it has been estimated to be worth millions of dollars. PC players get f*ed over because we are statistically less likely to buy shark cards compared to our console peers (follow the money) and to add insult to injury, those of us who solo Cayo Perico have been getting our primary takes significantly nerfed. By all means, make the heist more difficult, but the primary takes should pay more. R* also decided to take away the ability to fast travel via Kosatka during bike/bunker sell missions. Console players enjoy a cheater-free experience because not only do they account for a much higher profit margin for R*, but because their pay-to-play online providers do not allow for cheating on their platforms; they essentially pay a monthly protection fee. Is there fun to be had in public lobbies? Absolutely. However, one must exercise caution as modders are able to crash your game on purpose, give themselves god mode, as well as exposing your IP address which means you should use a VPN. Do all of your grinding in a private lobby and you'll be fine, but be sure to switch to a single player character once a modder starts to ""have his way"" with you!  NVIDIA users: there is an anti-aliasing method that everyone should be using in order sharpen the lines of the game. Go to your NVIDIA control panel > manage 3D settings > program settings > select GTA V on the drop down menu > multi-frame sampled AA (MFAA) set to ""on"". I have personally seen this option improve the visual clarity on lower-spec'd mobile cards as well as high-end desktop cards :)"
i mean its gta v what else i need to say
"It's GTA V, what more do you expect?"
Price is very good in steam as other platform
Very fun but should not let a kid under 12 or 13 play it

goood as shit
good game would much recommend
gud game to play
STOP FIRING ROCKETS AT MY HOUSE

the strip club is the best part of this game
"I will no longer play this game or have anything to do with Rockstar. you have made logins, UID transitions and support unbearable.  Goodbye."
tge sex update isr eal in this game
love the game very much!!!

is pretty fun for me
this game is sick

GTA online? more like loading screen simulator

grabt he auto six )i love kidion moder menu)
Good for kids
the casino is the best place on the map
"shot some cops,  went home and played the game pretty unrealistic"
"killed some guy for fun, he posted my ip address in chat for fun. i feel safe"
"loved the story, too many cheaters and sweats in online."
I've had the game for quite a while. 5 years ago i was pretty sure I had completely outplayed it... I just played it last week and it's boring but that's coming from a player with 2k hours on steam. I migrated from Xbox one and 360 as I had pre ordered the game. I know this review seems negative but that's only due the the lack of gta 6. If you haven't ever played this you better play it because it's worth it. If your R* then F u for making me buy this game on multiple console and platforms multiple times as you avoid releasing a new game. Thats is all.   Also if you do buy it here R* has gated some content to the PlayStation so they want me to buy it again or what? (I will not)
run over people is fun to me so yes yes funyy ha
gg good

"Non existent anti cheat system. Cheaters ruining all the fun I had. They can just teleport you, control your vehicle, kill you whenever they want. Horrible experience."

"The most restrictive open-world to come out of a AAA developer. It picks and chooses when to be realistic, almost always to the detriment of fun. You’re basically playing a tech demo, that tries as hard as it can to make an open-world game linear.   For a game named after a crime, and known for glorifying gangsters, it sure is tame AF. Check out these verbatim reasons for failing in-game missions:  - There was a disturbance at the showroom - You notified the neighborhood (if you make too much noise, literally seconds before a scripted event that notifies the neighborhood). - You abandoned Lamar (by getting out of a burning car?) - Tracey fled in fear - Franklin spooked a rival racer  Are you fucking kidding me?! I was half expecting “emotional damage” to pop up at some point.   Throw in telepathic, teleporting cops who materialize out of thin air in seconds, any time you fire a gun, anywhere on the map, and you’ve got a case study in wasted potential.   The gaming equivalent of paying for a fancy dinner, only to find out it’s made of wax."
"Traditional cannoli cream uses a sheep’s milk ricotta which I prefer - if I can get my hands on it. Any other high fat unpasteurized milk will work. Or if you want to cut some corners or are tight on time you can start off with any decent premade ricotta. Skip the low fat stuff, you’re making cannoli.  3 cups of drained ricotta  1.3 cups of confectioner’s sugar  1.5 tsp vanilla  Orange Zest  Using a hand or stand mixer, whip together these ingredients for a few minutes until well incorporated. Transfer from a bowl to a piping bag and keep in the refrigerator until ready to use.  The Shells  This is part that can easily go wrong and where you need to have a zen mindset. This recipe makes about 45 small to medium sized shells.  1.5 cups of all purpose Flour  .5 tsp cinnamon powder  1.5 tsp cocoa powder  2 tbsp white sugar  .5 tsp salt  3 tbsp cubed and chilled butter  2 tbsp Marsala  .5 tsp white vinegar  .25 cup of water  1 egg (for the wash)  Heat a neutral, high heat oil to 350F in a deep pot or fryer.  In stand mixer, combine all of the dry ingredients and mix well. Add in wet ingredients (except the egg) and continue to blend for a few minutes. Mixture will be somewhat crumbly. Remove from the bowl and pour out onto a large working surface.  Knead with your hands for 5 - 10 minutes until you have a mostly smooth and homogeneous ball of dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.  Remove the dough from the plastic and cut into about 5 smaller pieces. Flour the dough balls gently. Pass each ball through the pasta maker, going from the widest setting down about 6 settings. Be slow and methodical, and don’t skip any steps.  Lay each sheet of dough out on your work surface and gently flour again. Using your circular punch out form, cut circles and save all of the excess dough which you’ll use for one final pass through the pasta maker.  Carefully and tightly wrap/roll each cut circle around the cannoli tube, and seal the edge with your egg wash. Be extremely careful not to let egg get all over the place. Avoid getting the egg on the cannoli tube or the dough will end up sticking to the tube while frying. Clean up any egg that gets on your work surface.  When the oil temperature has reached 350F, drop each tube into the oil and fry until golden. Using tongs, turn the cannoli in the oil so they cook evenly. This should take only about 1 minute.  Transfer to a rack lined with paper towels and carefully slide the shells off of the tubes while it’s still hot. You’ll want to use more paper towels so you don’t burn your fingers.  The tubes should be wiped down, and chilled in the refrigerator for just 1 - 2 minutes before starting the next round of shells. This avoids a lot of mess ups.  The finishing touches  Once the shells have completely cooled you can start filling the cannoli. This is made easier as a two person task and makes for a fun family activity, but is manageable by one person if necessary. Using the piping bag, fill each shell starting with the center and working outwards. Nothing worse than a cannoli with a big empty pocket of air in the middle. Once completely filled, you can garnish with whatever you like. Traditional toppings include candied fruit, crushed pistachio, or chocolate chips. When the cannoli are all dressed up and ready to go, you can give them all a final dusting of confectioner’s sugar. They should be eaten fresh as they start to lose their textural appeal if they sit around too long and get soggy."

I love driving around Los Santos.
fun game for kids

"Amazing game with great storyline and everything is perfect, its more than a decade now but still gta v is the best game in open world games category, as always whether my xbox one or my ps4 i always loved this game and now playing it on pc aswell! best game ever"
Excellent game
very fun game if you have money
what a legend
Very fun game. But stay tf away from online heists that require other people (if you dont have friends that own the game) because you will barely get any of the heists done.
Waiting for GTA 6 !!!!!!!!!!!
I feel evil... like- like a criminal is coming inside of me!
What to say? It is Gta 😁

"menu ? kid ? don ? donki d ? modest donkid menu ? aha very good game , atleast you know exactly whats going on unlike all these other games that everyone claim to be skilled , here , you see gamers for what they really are , bunch of loser monkeys with a keyboard and screen infront of em who cant play for shit."
"if you have friends ""wink wink"" best game ever"
"The heists are good and all, but the connection settles everything. Feels like I'm connecting from a different planet. Takes a whole 30 minutes to load into online and as soon as you load in, half the time you immediately get shot dead. If you're into that, I'd recommend, but for normal people, don't play."
ha ha car go vrooom

"This is the first game that I've ever bought for myself and I'm happy that I chose to start with. This game is tons and tons of fun and lots of content that can keep you going for hours and hours . This game is fun. I've already put in around 550 hours into it and I haven't even covered many of the heists and am yet to start a few of the businesses yet. So if you want a game that is well worth your money, what else are you waiting for? This game is the one!"
i played like max 10 minutes still cool tho
its very cool game and i liked the missions
a really good game
better than rdr
forget thousnad thing everyday
Great deal during sale + the enterprise pack as well.

must playy
Its been a while since their last release but its alright
Game is so great!
dont play online on pc
"i wanted to play this game since it's release. i am die hard fan of GTA series. due to my financial situations, i couldn't focus on gaming and afford a gaming pc/laptop. now I'm 34 and finally life became stable. and got a gaming laptop and played it.  apart from a game. emotional connect. just completed the story mode. have to do a lot more in game and then GTA ONLINE.  Thanks rockstar games for making wonderful moments"

"Time consumer, grindy, I don't like the economy, I don't like that I can't get stable 60 fps with above average pc, overally game is fun but online not much at all. I'd recommend doe the story mode it was great!    I can't be mad doe, friend bought me this game to play with him so I'd"
"What can be said about Grand Theft Auto V that hasn't already been said a million times? This game is a masterpiece and I am blown away by how modern it feels, even 10 years after it's release. Sure, the controls can be a bit janky and the story gets messy towards the end, but as an all around experience it still holds up incredibly well. Every time I play this game I feel like I went on vacation to California. The world feels so alive and its full of many activities. The attention to detail is absolutely mind-boggling. The ""mini-games"" actually have plenty of depth to them. You can spend hours playing golf and tennis, or cruising around and taking in the sights at various beaches, mountains, and forests. Car customization is very deep and rivals every racing game out there that was out in 2013. Also a special shout out to the soundtrack which is full of every genre you can think of and ranges from old school throwbacks, to modern (for 2013) music, to even some updated recent songs that released long after GTA V came out. Although the story may not please everyone, this game has some of the most memorable characters in all of gaming. Franklin, Trevor, Michael, Lamar, even the yoga instructor, are all unforgettable characters. There is constantly something fun going on in this game and there's never a dull moment."
"Great game, but there are bugs that require you to either reset the game or play with your settings. Overall this game is prob one of my fav OAT"
"This is really weird i actually like this game. It's a decent grinding game  The grind for money is not that hard if you know what to do and it's been a blast for the past few months robbing drug lord over and over,stealing from heavily guarded casino in town and saving the world from doomsday with my friend  The community is actually not that bad while yes i agree modder and griefer are pain in the ass but the majority of player i meet in public or heist is friendly and chill.   Can't wait what gta 6 and gta online 2 can offer,superr excited!!"
i really like it is better then xbox gta because on xbox gta its more hard to shoot and you can play fivem and i give gta pc ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
disappointing strip club
IS ASS
"story mode is a masterpiece Online is cringy af, Too grindy too little reward"
This game is very fun there is a lot to do RECOMMEND
"Very immersive world, lots of attention to detail, much to explore"
gud game erm add a minigun railgun to be better game
"Love this franchise from the first GTA game on, that I played back in pre-2k era. The level of detail and immersivness is staggering. Not to mention the optimizations - runs like butter, purrs like a kitten :) great game overall."
Running over hookers was more fun than expected.
this is awesome game
its a classic never gets boring
It's the bomb
"this game is ass, dont waste your time"
i fucking love this game men 💖
"Trash game. loading time very long, hackers almost every team-up, vehicle missing after entering garage in missions, mechanic don't pickup in fucking missions, hosting heist mission after lunch get disconnect and re-enter server get stuck in loading screen about 2-4 times a day, cant replay missions after complete it need to waste time to re lunch the mission."
the funest game i have played with my friends i remember playing this at 2 am laughing my ass off and having the most fun in my life not careing about anything no depression or haveing to dread the mornings just pure fun
"Pile of Garbage I have been trying to play this with my wife for the last week, but it crashes to desktop for no reason so often I don't even want to play it anymore"
killing people is fun
This Game Is Really Fun But I Would Enjoy It More Fl It Had A Workshop!

I love to shoot and kill people. 10/10
"Good game and story line is great, few bugs but overall really fun"
skeyeee ona squirt bucket deddy
good game ye
"Good game. Liked the killings and the weapons. Don't really like the cars, but then again I am not good at racing. Overall, a fun and enjoyable game  Subsequently I down-voted though. Not sure whether it is a less common issue, but the game launcher is rather buggy. Difficultly in launching the game, especially GTA 5 online. Similar to GTA 4 being buggy within gameplay for the PC version as well"
zaza confirmed
shoot hookers
the graghis
A FUN GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS
its cute
I Like it because of very fun private dances.
Amaxing game
great game!
Game is fun for a couple of months but once you get rich and start owning all the items in the game there really isnt anything to do since you have every heist unlocked they need to add new heists instead of all these dumb new vehicles it got so bad for me to the point i decided to download cheats and give myself 10000B dollars because i wanted to be banned so my account could be reset to restart the game and it didnt take me even 2 weeks to get to level 50 and unlock most heists get the game its fine at the start.
I shoot and drive
"Once I got it running on the Steam Deck it was great. But the installation experience was bad. It's pain to enter login information in the stupid Rockstar launcher, and then it tells you to enter a key but doesn't specify what key it is. For some reason, in my case, performance initially was severely degraded, but after hard resetting the Steam Deck multiple times it finally recovered."

If you know a way to earn real cash out of the game play or else dont
I love everything about it
I PUNCHED WOMEN
"Would 100% Recommend to others. Be mindful this game isn't bad as you can quite literally avoid the ""drug and sex related things in this game"" even in the story mode. Like it does show some ""Drug and sex related things"" but if you're playing ""Online you can avoid them"""

dont go to the shoe store   worst mistake of my life
You can steal cars and sheet
"Wanna be a psychotic maniac? This game is for you! You wanna be a normal citizen? This game is also for you! You wanna play online with other people? You can do that! You wanna play with only your friends? That can do! You like good graphics? We got it here! You want a health system that's a bit...too realistic? Yep, this game has it all!"

"Grand Theft Auto V (2013)  Second GTA i ever owned in my life, the first one was GTA 3 on my old Netbook with Windows XP back when i was 9 the only reason i got to buy it on Steam despite having it on the PS3 was that it had GTA Online, pretty good online in my opinion, played it like 8 times and im still on level 5 since i got the game back in May 2023, im going to rate both the Story Mode and the Online mode now, so lets start with Story Mode  Story Mode ah yes, the Story Mode, (Warning: Includes Spoiler but im sure everyone knows already the entiry story by now) so, pretty interesting, some Heist that happend 20 years ago in 2004, bla bla bla 9 years later, 2013 and 2 of those guys responsible for the heist meet again bla bla bla, murdering and shit  i rate the Story Mode, 9 missing copies of GTA 3 on the PS3 and Xbox 360 out of 10  Online Mode: this review is too long so fuck it, 7.5/10"
"10 years old in 2001 I got GTA 3 I begged my mom 11 years old in 2002 I bought Vice city at school a classmate sold it to me cause his PS2 broke 13 in 2004 bought SA 17 in 2008 bought GTA IV 22 in 2013 bought GTA V 34 in 2025 will buy GTA VI  Rockstar's GTA games have become an integral part of my life, and I'm grateful for the joy they've brought me."
I want to kms. Oppressor mk2 people are r wording me
i only drive around in story mode and do the same in online mode besides causing pain and misery occasionally to people just trying to have fun by killing them
best game :D
"10/10 1 person said ""happy new years"" thats more than people in real life, we winning"
very good!!!
"After almost 500 hours of game-play inside and outside of Steam, I can confidently tell you that Rockstar treats it's player base horribly. So many parts of the Online experience are forced to be done solo, as they have no benefit to doing them with friends. Payouts for almost every single activity is minimal and feels like a spit in the face after you realize grinding for 100 hours will only net you disappointment. Every part of the Online experience is there to punch you in the dick and then hand you a single ice cube to make it sting a little less, but Rockstar are still the ones who did the kicking in the first place.  If you want to play this game for it's online, be prepared to ditch all public lobbies since they have at least one hacker in them at all times. All things worth doing will be done in a Crew only lobby, or in a closed mission where you can typically only bring in 3 friends. Rockstar may keep pushing horrible content updates that give you new ways to waste time, but they're never going to be worth investing your time. Do not buy this game, do not buy their next GTA, just don't waste your time with these disrespectful developers."
dopey WW
it's fun tbh
"Very good game with an amazing story and good graphics for it's release date. Btw for the people playing online and didn't get anything from the criminal enterprise starter pack wait from 12 to 24 hours and make sure you finished the prologue in the story mode. Go into settings and then on online. Click on ""criminal enterprise starter pack"" From there you can view all the properties, vehicles and more.   NOTE: You can only get the weapons if you are under level 5. To get the properties and the other things you need to be over level 5 to claim them."
Bro I can't even play the game I logged in with a social user on the rockstar games launcher and It talks about unlinking an accout or sum and I contact support they help but I still can't play I have tryed everything I can
"kad geimas tai tikrai, bet ir kad blogas tai tikrai nepasakyciau"

dis game is vey family friendly and will teach youre child very important luve lessons
WOW GAMES PLAY Thanks You
great game classic
My fondest memory of this game was seeing a van drive up with Fred from Scooby Doo exiting it and running up to me to clock me straight in the face.
its a very good game only bad part is the amount of storage it takes
"It has been more than six years since I last played this game.  The single player campaign was and remains the most impressive one in any game that I have ever played. I can still recall various plot twists and angles of the story. As for character design, it doesn't get much better than Trevor. Now, I don't know if GTA6 (which was announced late 2023) will ever come to PC, but if its anything like GTA5 its going to be great.  I didn't play much of the GTA5 Online because I quickly got tired of all the hackers and griefers. However, get this game for the single player campaign, it is awesome!"
Really fun game to play
CLASS
its really fun
i enjoy this game even online
"""You forget a thousand things everyday pal how about you make sure its one of them """
Its just so much fun to play with friends and to pass the time
Rockstar you rock !!!
"Infinite loading while my perfect heist. Infinite loading while im trying to join a heist/job lobby, almost every session has cheater and sometimes infinite loading while im just trying to play an online."
there is nothing i dislike about this game it's so good i can't stop even if i wanted to i really recomend it
best of the best for 18 yrs
lovly
"Since invitation-only sessions and more SOLO missions have existed, GTA Online is worth a lot more.  BUT, it bothers me too much that the PC version is less supported than the other platforms. Where is the ray tracing update? What about the animals in GTA Online?   PC players deserve more respect."
"I've played on and off for over 1500 hours since release. I just tried to come back to the game after a few months away, and now Rockstar won't let me log into my account or send me a password reset email. Seems to be a fairly common issue too, I don't know what their deal is but if you're going to lock your game behind DRM the least you can do is make sure it can handle basic account management."
its fuc king great
"The strength and uniqueness of GTA is that it includes many games into one. This one is no different - there are a ton of things you can do with your friends, especially when you start buying different businesses.  I would probably not recommend it for solo as it is doable but feels more boring therefore more grindy and not ideal. The PC port doesn't seem to be perfect but it should be running well on most current machines."
very good very nice
good stuff
It is a real fun game
goob game
Amazing game. Can't wait for GTA VI next year!
YOR DAD COULD BE IN IT
W game  Gets boring after a while tho
So many F word.
"I hate this game, the graphics are terrible I got scammed in online and the updates are useless. JUST FOCUS ON GTA 6!"
I thought this was a game about stealing cars. Not Nostalgia Simulator.
i love u and gta
"I saw enough reviews to know not to touch the online mode. But the story and gameplay are everything you know and love about rockstar games. Zany characters. Social commentary. Cool heists. Still a good game by all accounts, even in 2023."

"I am a new player to GTA V online. I am trying to do my best but the game is just bullshit... full of bugs and players are so cringe killing you with every occasion. There is an email that you get in game with a treasure hunt, if you finish this mission I think you get like 250k/treasure hunt. The problem is that every time I get this email and start the mission, after a while the session of game ends due to and ""unsuspected error""... it is 3rd time when this happened to me and I have to wait hours to get that email again... and hopefully the session wont end do to an ""UNSUSPECTED ERROR"" again FKING ROCKSTAR GAMES !!"

"I highly do  not recommend this game. If you are in it for the cars just download five m and join a server, if you are in it to mess around and have fun with friends then install a mod bar but most definitely... most definitely... do not grind this game."

nobody is going to ever see this review because who would ever look at reviews for a game this popular and this old. good game tho
Great game I love it
Its a very fun game
"Positive: GTA 5 is a powerful continuation of a legendary gaming series that has captured my heart since its early days. The game's strength lies in its extensive and captivating story, which can be experienced from three different character perspectives, providing the game with incredible replayability and depth. Each character is uniquely designed and contributes to a rich and engaging world full of life and adventure. The multiplayer aspect also shines with a variety of missions and activities that can be undertaken solo or with friends, creating dynamic and unpredictable gaming scenarios.  Negative: Despite the many positive aspects, the multiplayer part receives criticism for going overboard with certain elements, especially when it comes to the introduction of overly futuristic vehicles like flying motorcycles. For me, this has disrupted the realistic and down-to-earth feel that the GTA series has traditionally aimed for, creating an imbalance in the game's dynamics.  Summary: GTA 5 stands as a titan in the gaming world with a rich and dynamic narrative, memorable characters, and a fun and extensive multiplayer mode. While some elements in multiplayer may feel exaggerated, the game's overall offering is still of an exceptional caliber that few other games can match. For long-time fans and new players alike, GTA 5 offers a world filled with adventure, laughter, and excitement"
Great game ruined by modding and Cheating!
I've only been playing this game lately only because of an australian guy who plays GTA 5 faster than average.

Masterpiece for a reason!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YESSSSSS ITS GTA < BUT YOU ALREADY knew tHis>.....
W Game Fr
so silly.
I'm late to playing this game but since GTA 6 has been announced I wanted to try it out since ive never really sat down and played this game. Truly one of the coolest game ideas to actually get put into motion and it's still pretty fun. Hyped for GTA 6 because people remember GTA 5 when it first came out even though I wasnt there for it and im pumped to be there for the start of GTA 6.
good game until gta6 release

VERY GOOD GAME VERY LEGEND CANT WAIT FOR GTAV6 JUST KNOW IT WILL BE EPIC LIKE GTA5
sooo goood
"Best Game I ever played, Waiting for GTA VI"
"ATTENTION: Enable dual factor authentication to protect your account! I have over 500 hours in this game and someone was able to switch the email I was using. I have sent multiple tickets to Rockstar's support with help regarding this issue and have been blown off. Look it up on Google. Many people have lost their accounts to this issue for YEARS and it's STILL occurring.   Let's say that you want to try a different Rockstar account when you start the game through steam-because of the way GTA is linked to your steam and Rockstar account, you will not be able to play the game through a different Rockstar account. Also, due to this issue, I have lost other Rockstar games associated with my account. I spent my hard earned money on multiple Rockstar products, now they are permanently lost, and there is nothing I can do about it. Shame on Rockstar for not even remotely trying to fix this issue."

"GTA V, what better game to play when you have some free time to relax, right? Wrong. GTA V is a soul sucking grind that makes you want to slam your head into your desk and dont get me started about the online player base. 85% of the people are cheating and if they arent, they just wanna blow you up. so no its not fun. unless your me. A masochist"
gta after 10 year still better than other game
vERY NICE FUNNY AND epic
ielly relly like this game guys its so much fun hazard
i only kill ppl with jets
"Kinda like to let my rage out, and do the things my intrusive thoughts won't let me do irl."
"Since nobody will read the reviews, I'll say in this review I'm straight and I love dressing as a coolguy."

Imagine not playing this
gta rocks and will forever be the best
i have only had this game for a day and it is already my favorite game
its a w
IT LAGS OFF EVERY MINUTE
crazy game
Fun :)
"Really good game, online is good but the story is lacking in some parts, but i think the story is ok but not as good a some other rockstar game, overall i rate this game a 7/10."
"GTA 5 for PC is a masterpiece with exciting missions, diverse gameplay, and stunning graphics. The attention to detail in the vast world of Los Santos is impressive. It's a must-play game and one of the best of all time. Don't miss out on this extraordinary experience before GTA 6!"
I dont have any words I just love this game
"very nice ""dances"""
100%

"consider this as a sideways thumb. GTA online is kind of a mess, rly fun with friends when you can find the content but there's a ton of cheaters so stick to private lobbys."
awesome game for benchmarking PC's and just having fun with the game storyline
The game is amazing
better game than gta san andreas and pretty much all the gta franchise
its dope
great game to waste away in my room too
"This game is amazing, old but gold, good plot, good character development, just an exuberant game overall."
Have played this game for many years and still love it
EVERything is good abt the game
great game just too many hackers in public games
It is fun and you have alot of things that you could do in it.
"go to the high heel icon and talk to one of the nice ladies there. but before you do this, make sure you're mother is watching too. you are welcome in advance!!"

Rockstar Games is fcking brain dead but its pretty fun

Pickle 👍

Love this game
"Excellent story mode. One of my favorite games ever. Online is terribly flawed, and it's not fun solo. Even with friends, online still somewhat sucks as a game."
I killed all the fat people
it is a game
its fun playing with you friends
"If your expecting a masterpiece based on how many people know this game and the hype that is following gta 6 then I don't recommend this game. If your looking for interesting and engaging story I don't recommend, if you want to just drive around city, stealing stuff and killing cops then I recommend the game. The characters you meet in the game are interesting and the banter is enjoyable to witness but as far as their own character progression goes there is none. Entertaining moment are sandwiched in between long travel times. The travelling does get very boring to the point where you just end up taking the taxi everywhere as it is more efficient. The open world while very lively and believable is pretty shallow and lacks content. Minus the travel times the missions are fine but each mission lacks a strong tie to the story to the point where a lot of the missions feel like filler stuff just so the gang can do interesting things. This leads to moments where there isn't something to keep you looking forward to the next thing. There is stat upgrades like better stamina or better shooting which you upgrade by using that actual stat. If you run a lot then your stamina will upgrade. Overall the upgrades are minimal and don't end up changing your play style."
Gta ONLINE IS A VERY BAD ROLE PLAY IS GOOD!
TOP GAME !
monke
me like game
Clasic no need for explanation
this game is great awesome story great protagonists ive played this game for years on a console and only recently got this game and i love the mods you can get.
"I love this game and even the name of the game ""Minecraft"" is too good. Oh my bad this isn't minecraft?"
i poo'd
fun to try get a 5 star
Whichever nigga who make aircraft system deserve death sentence and rot in hell for being a dumbass who think numpad should work for a fucking plane.
YOU CAN kill everyone very fun indeed
WORSE ONLINE GAME EXPERIENCE!  Most terrible way to play online with your FRIEND! More than 3 hours I spent in this *&%# and was not able even to see my friend in the game - not I can connect to him neither he can connect to me!!!

it is just a good game highly recommend game that everyone should try
.... DO I NEED TO EXPLAIN???

"OG game, can never go wrong with this."
One of the greatest games ever created
I don't really have much to say other than of course this game is great!!!

I own gta 5 on steam and rockstar launcher steam version recommended as theres zero hackers launcher version is full of hackers
"love it on pc, or just in general"
loops
"Fix the servers or close them down ffs Literally unplayable right now, dont even try"
best game for kids
"Fun, Good story and fun online. Fun to play with friends and shooter, planes"
decent story mode and online mode (when there isn't cheaters and greifers) for online mode i would recommend making a private game for you and your friends to avoid those types of people
"THe game for when you ever felt like you had to just go and do when the cars and you grab them and then drive them until you commit a crime or atrocity of sort within the confines of the game then go to the job of sorts and steal and plunder from the innocent and it could last 10 minutes, 1 hour, 5 hours as the crow flies maybe consider this game as one of them that is good and maybe not one to be skipped out on like i know you want"
"After half a decade of virtual penny-pinching, I finally splurged on GTA V with my hard-earned cash! 😭 I used to roll with the cr*cked, cruising the digital streets on a budget because, let's face it, my wallet was as empty as my in-game garage. Now, every pixel in Los Santos knows I'm legit. Who needs real-life cash when you can buy a virtual yacht and live your best pixelated life? My bank account may be crying, but my in-game character is living their best life. The things we do for love... and epic car chases! 🚗💸"
Tiene muy buena historia y está bueno el online
What can i say? Its GTA. Its fun

"This is my first time playing Grand Theft Auto V... (yes 10/11 years late I'm aware)  however my first impression overall: its a great and fun game, worth the price in my opinion, and even though i have not completed the game yet (just got it 2 weeks ago) would totally recommend playing it to newcomers like me."

pretty good its kind of confusing when you first start but you might not have that
i love indiscriminate murder
"Good story,  good characters. But in offline main characters are not allowed to purge cops and to 0 within a period   of time. This is very ANNOYING and really ruins the gaming experience. In Fallout 4 or Witcher 3, although guards will reappear, main character can always completely eliminate them within a certain period of time."
yes game good
best game For Ever
"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."
its a VERY fun and entertaining game
i love it so much
it is so good the gameplay is soooooo good but i can't what tell gta6
it is one of the most exciting games that i have ever played in my life.I highly recommend others to experience the open world of GTA V...
all of it.
"Even after 11 years of release, it's still a masterpiece"

one of the best games! You almost can do everything Most of the game types you like are in the game. is constantly being improved and developed
get out of the reviews and buy the game

"Abysmal loading times, constant crashes, full to the brim with pointless mechanics and busy work that make even the simplest gameplay convention into a chore.  The online mode is fun, but completely broken. Constant glitches, from missions that become unbeatable to expensive ammo and resources just disappearing out of my inventory for no reason every now and then.  Many official online missions clearly had little to no play testing done, and some of them are truly miserable experiences (even before you take the griefers into account). It's also grindy as Hell, but we all know that's intentional to tempt you into buying CRIMINALLY EXPENSIVE microtransactions. And let's not forget the complete lack of moderation, so hackers just run rampant to a frankly astonishing degree. I usually stick to ""invite only"" sessions because public online is just unplayable at this point.  Of course, if anything bad happens, like you get hacked or lose access to your account, Rockstar doesn't give a damn. You just can't play or even make a new account anymore, sucks to be you.  The story mode is pretty good, all things considered."
tnx
nice game but san andreas better than all gta series

"Don't waste the Criminal enterprise starter pack money, instead buy a kosatka with it, So you can do Cayo perico heist. I am telling this because I wasted it on the useless casino penthouse."
"For the online: Still buggy and annoying here and there. However, great fun with friends when it works. It became insanely complex with tons of minigames and such, but good fun."
"Good and fun game, its really fun with friends to mess around and cause mayhem."

Game for masochists. Exactly my taste.
"My friend who I play CS 2 with said if I post a review on GTA 5, and it gets 75 likes and 30 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 3060 and 1 Kilo of Lemon . So im just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha  GTA 6 IS COMING BABY!!!!!  I am a 45 -year -old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father raising my son, who is now 14 years old. My son won this game from his uncle, so we installed him on his computer and he started playing. Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game. This was horrible for me, because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son, because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube. So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him. I bought the game, chose my skin and world and started playing, but I was stuck in what you should do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died. Since then, this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well. This game reminded me that there is fun in everything, and I brought many happy memories to me and my son.  My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on gtav and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here."
pretty good ngl My brother let me play it and i went to the shoe store because i wanted to buy some shoes but i actually saw something else something big that i never saw before but still a pretty fun game

Very good game special online
Game suddenly claims my activation code has already been claimed. Can't play the game I bought or retrieve my save data. I've only ever played on this account. No other company marketing their game on Steam uses BS DRM like this. I should have just stolen it if they're gonna treat me like a criminal for giving them money. Never buying a Rockstar game again.
"experince was nice,still waiting for GTA6"
the game is good trust
lets have a toast for the assholes lets have a toast for the scum bags runaway fast as you can
"Soo beautiful so elegant just looking like a WOW, except for the fact that online is messed up"

Story happened alright and online was so bad it jogged my memory of losing interest in this game the last time I played it. A lot of high level accounts just use their boosted stats to play god mode on low ranking players which has always been a problem because there's no matchmaking.
the modders a good the nice ones are good
Its Gta what u expect? ITS GOOD AS HELL
ts fun
should add sex
uhh... gta 5!!!!11!111!!!
Computer restart if your game freezes the game

GOOD GRAPHICS AND FUN MISSIONS YOU REALLY NEED THIS GAME MAN
i like playing it
Let's play GTA 5 on Steam
I'm old and can't stand controllers so some of this game is REALLY frustrating but all in all it is a fun game. I enjoy the missions and the driving
"would expect a lot more maturity from a 10 year old game  the game is fully bugged, every session I play I will hit some kind of issue or another  don't have this problem with any other game  examples: - sit down on computer, gets stuck - login to computer, gets stuck - get into some buildng, get stuck - receive/send some transaction, get stuck  half the time it gets stuck, it just shows a black screen for 15 mins or longer until I get kicked out of the session for being inactive  how am I supposed to play the game"
online is so much fun i plunged a knife in my spleen
uytfgfg

"Grand Theft Auto V/Online is a game that effortlessly blends an engaging single-player narrative with a dynamic and expansive multiplayer experience. The attention to detail in the open-world environment is nothing short of breathtaking, offering a stunning backdrop for the thrilling heists and missions. The characters are well-developed, and the storyline is gripping, keeping players invested from start to finish. The transition to Grand Theft Auto Online adds an exciting layer of multiplayer mayhem, providing endless opportunities for exploration, collaboration, and, of course, chaos. With its seamless integration of a compelling narrative and a vast online playground, GTA V/Online continues to be a benchmark for the gaming industry."

"very fun, story very good and alot of cool cars u can buy with money u can earn by robbing banks"
"I just finished the story (ending C) and I love this game man. The story was super fun, the map and the open world was amazing, I didn't do much of them but the stranger/freak missions were great. The online is great too. Definitely up there with some of the best story games I've ever played. If only they used midnight city or memory reboot for the C ending. That would've really been awesome. Great game."
big fun
"Lots to do, good voice acting, combat could be a little tighter."
i wish i had friends to fill my lobby for modded sex but you c and s and j and other c need sex from man you know what i mean hehe poo poo
stripclub
I love this game. I still play this game. However I have to vote NO since GTA Online is a complete mess. Rockstar ain't what it used to be. Let's hope they eventually add all the extra content from Online to the solo campaign.
"GTA 5 as a story, phenomenal. As an online Video Game, $300 worth of repairs. I think there's still a hole in my wall."
very chill but lot of hacker
grandma aw
"Tried, but didn't like doing crime. GTA5 required shooting police officers in the opening scene. Just couldn't do it."

"Grand Theft Auto V isn't just a game; it's a memory, its broken the barrier past nostalgia and become something entirely different. Every moment in the fictional city of Los Santos is a testament to the care and detail the developers have poured into this creation. It's not just the stunning visuals or the dynamic soundtrack that make this game a masterpiece, but the way it makes you feel part of an expansive, living world. The story, woven through the lives of Michael, Trevor, and Franklin, is more than just a series of missions; it's a journey through their wild lives and achieves a level of immersion that I have yet to replicate in other games today.  The heart of GTA 5 lies in its ability to offer something for everyone. Whether you're tearing through the streets in a high-speed chase, enjoying a quiet moment watching the sunset over the Vinewood hills, or teaming up with friends in GTA Online, the game seamlessly blends adrenaline-pumping action with quiet, moments. It's this balance that makes the experience so memorable. GTAV will always keep its position as top 5 games i've ever played, I remember being 11 years old with my PS3 going to that gamestop with my mom and getting the game, bringing it home launching the game and hearing that echo of the siren in the loading screen. Nothing beats this feeling and I don't think anything will come close to this for any other generation.  10/10"
Class
good mods
bad.
tehher
"very fun and lots to do until you beat it, bu"

"The support is an absolute disgrace. You are forced to carry out very long ""tests"" in order to be able to send a message. The support itself consists of an AI, or cognitively untalented aliens.   The scam with the Social Club connecting to Steam - which means you can't create a new Social Club account - is intended to milk the cow again.   I've been playing GTA since childhood. Not anymore."
Rockstar Social Club is hot garb.
"Man ill tell you what, i love this game. there is so much to do in this game, i reallky enjoy playing the online version. i recommend this for anyone over 16yrs of age. ha ha ha and im 54."
Super fun!
this game is crazy bro!!!!!!! i got 3 million right now but i am looking to start a side hustle and increase my moneys!!!!!
The vehicle handling has improved significantly since the first 3D GTA game.

Chumma Game 😘😘
"Not very happy. Rockstar even though I chose my local storage drive decided on their own to place files on a cloud drive, now 22hrs of gameplay gone. I dont use cloud services so when i got a message saying it was fulli just deleted it and paused syncing. This is a little creepy since I never gave permission to anyone to access my onedrive account, no where did it ask. I installed to a local storage m.2 drive not the cloud. To top it off this is the third time ive bought this dam game, 1st pc, 2nd ps4, and now again pc. First time account was stolen and pc stolen at same time. Ps4 well lost all that to life problems. but now i could install through steam so fealt safe and bought again only to have it not be, and to be some real creapy like looking into places i never gave access. I looked now they got files and folders again all over the onedrive/cloud drive just from playing again and thats just messed up cause i agin said no to cloud and that said rockstar servers but idk this is just crazy"
"muito bom, não tem nem o que dizer o modo história é incrível, o mundo aberto também..."

it crashed within 5 minutes of me playing every single time 24 dollars down the drain.
"Good, the bug is getting quirky XD"
Best game oat cant wait for gta 6
"I mained it on ps4, and then went over on to pc on a fresh account and both times were incredibly fun, especially since i love grinding. I only wish that there went such metas, house heists suck and nobody does them since the diamond casino and cayo perico are just that much better in every way. Other than that great fun."
very nice game with very nice road to dreive on and trevors so cute

"I just did not like the servers for GTA online as in some, there are modders and cheaters and in some normal servers its just too many people and some are so glitched that none of my friends or I can join the server with my friends."
Well i can finally try this game. still good game in 2023.

Fucking garbage!!! I spent EXTRA on the whale shark and spawned into online with no fucking money!! Rockstar has somehow gotten worse than EA :( POS garbage developers. . . I hope everyone in every developers kin die the most painful deaths possible.. YOU MASSIVE FUCKING KUNTS!!!!!!!!!
very nice community game
"[h2]As a [b]first-time player[/b] of the GTA Franchise, I must say, this is a [b]world-class game[/b]! It deserves all the hype and awards it got. Totally worth the money spent. It is also [b]compatible with a low-end laptop[/b] by adjusting some parts in the settings. Kudos to the developers![/h2]"
Smash
You get to hit people with car
A good game.
"It's not as good as the rest of the GTA games, but the story is still decent and can be pretty fun, Online is kinda garbo though. The characters are charismatic and funny, and they all have good character development and arcs. So, would I recommend this game? Yes, I'd say I would, though it's rather disappointing in a way cause the story in GTA IV is so much better, still it's a really good game though with great gameplay."
its fuin whenever alayws got sum to do
"very fun, support takes a while to respond but when they do, support is decent"

"ah yes, good game"
"Nothing to say about this game  All know the game well, The world's best open world simulator game"
I love the quality of this game and theres sp may experiences in it/
allows me to fulfill my terroristical dreams
"Last time I played GTA V is when i had a slim Xbox 360. Got the game on a good sale on Steam and im flabbergasted on how many detailed improvements have been made with this game. Replaying the story is always delightful with the life like lighting effects, more detail to facial animation, and better performance in frame rate. Bravo to the devs at Rockstar Games."
great game to play
Good game but sadly I had to uninstall because of a lack of space
"Singleplayer is good. Online is perfect with zero flaws, doesn't crash/freeze at all and works perfectly all the time"
GTA5 is a good game. Period. W game frfr.
its fun but you cant enjoy a public lobby bcs of the lifeless modders.
gngnngngngngng\
over 10 years and it is still good i might buy GTA6
you know one thing t (midnight city plays) im getting too old for this nonsense (micheal enters car and drives off) (chorus of midnight city plays) credits roll ---------------------------------------------- Thank you Rockstar

"These people don't know how to program a game.  Edit: The more I play the worse it gets. These people really don't know how to design a game.  Edit two: This game does everything possible to make you NOT play with your friends. It doesn't matter if you are friends on Steam, friends on Rockstars Social Club, as well as Crew Members in the game that you register through a web page. The game will STILL make it SO YOU CAN NOT PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS. Every mission, it kicks you out. Every Heist, it kicks you out. If you play a game of tennis, it kicks you out. YOU CANNOT STAY TOGETHER NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. IT'S STUPID. DO NOT BUY THIS OR GTA6. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS TRASH COMPANY! If your in a heist with one friend your other friend CANNOT JOIN your server. After you complete the heist. The friend you were with get separated onto two different servers. Even after hosting a private friends only / crew only server. Also you can't even host a private online game without first going in to single player. If you just start online mode it throws you in a random game of strangers without even asking you if you want it friends only or not. SO IN ORDER TO PLAY YOU DO THE FOLLOWING: Start single player, host a private game, wait for friends to join, do a heist, get separated into two different servers, host a private game, wait for friends to join, play tennis, leave the court, get separated into two different servers, host a private game, wait for friends to join again, rinse repeat and never actually enjoy the game.  Edit again: It keeps scattering my friends across different servers and launching games when everyone is not ready. Only 2 of my 3 friends are in the lobby and the game forces a start. Starts a cut-scene that we cannot skip, even though we've already seen it before, and so we all have to Alt+F4 to quit the game. While still struggling to get my 3rd friend into the game. Who programmed this junk? Its horrible.  Edit 1/20/2024: I don't know what they did, but now the game is even worse then it was before."

"Online is broken. Constant network unreachability, drops from servers etc. Endless cheaters and a large number of malicious hacks that can corrupt your online account, lock up GUI and mess up computer. No tools to avoid or protect from this ( e.g. easy access to private sessions )."
I do not recommend
Fun and get to fuck shit up

Very nice game and lots of thing to do like driving shooting doing missions playing story mode and online with your friends and make friends
"Peice of shit game, rockstar doesn't give a shit no more."
it is a fucking great game
"What should you do to stay healthy until 2025 and be able to play GTA VI?  Sleep at least 8 hours a day. Exercise every day. 15-min walking or jogging are more than enough. This reduces risk of having a heart attack. Stay hydrated. Eat healthy. Important nutrients for eye health include vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc and omega-3. You can eat walnuts instead of potato chips while lying on the couch. Through that when walking on the street, you can see a car more clearly, notice obstacles such as potholes, sewer pipes on the ground and avoid injuring yourself. Reduce the risk of infection by paying attention to hand washing. Remove toxic people from your life. This helps to protect your mental health. If you smoke, please try to quit. Don't push anyone's buttons. You probably won't want to get beaten or killed. While it might not have a direct impact on your health, to enjoy GTA VI more, you'll need to focus on it. Stop watching porn and those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10-second videos that ♥♥♥♥ with your skill."
good game brah
hacker go brrr
got it for 15 bucks defo worth it  love being able to cosmetically total my car and have it all repaired after a mission

"Great game, fun with friends and alone. 10/10"
"fun af, specially with mods"
I would recommend the game but the social club program is both frustrating and useless.
well it's rockstar's flagship franchise.... going strong 11 years after the release... amazing
good game yvan eht nioj
"Even after a decade, it's the best game ever. You get to see Trevor and Michael argue over something like a rock and you can run over innocent people. And if you coming from Xbox, it's definitely a big improvement over the Xbox version."
Great story and multiplayer
Fun with friends
I LIKE EVERYTHING ABT IT ITS JUS THAT THERE ARE 2 MUCH MODDERS

"Me Gun goes BANG, Me Gun goes CLICK."
it is really fun! but you have to remember one thing and that is (to make money you need to spend money)
"GTA V, very giggly, perhaps, a tad bit scrumptious, me and my main man be chillin' at the apartment fam, we be shooting up civilians, driving around some vehicles and we blow up duh cops on dee beach"
Goat Game

i liked everything
"""You Forget A Thousand Things Every Day, Pal. Make Sure This Is One Of 'Em."""

strip club is class
A little to snowy but recommend for 15+
one of the best games of all time.
HARD MODS THIS GAME
very indepth
game not loading while playing
"Good game, very fun"
Very much worth the price tag but still you need a good computer to play still very worth it though
Man this game is so good 100% the best game ive ever played buy this game!
"gta online has a lot of lag and delay, they cant even show the delay in milliseconds."
Online is now full of hackers. Most players have been here a long time and can be helpful if you show the ability to be helpful to them. Meaning the CEO organization thing is a great way for a low level player to gain money and level. Problem is its still GTA online and everytime you log in you are subject to possibly the worst gaming experience or sometimes the best you ever had. 10/10 must play. must own. had to have been there.
"Gta is rally legend game, and gta V is super cool game. You can play online (i like Role-play) thats amazing. So this game really must be in everyone library."
Fun playin gainst opressors :)
DOPEEEEEEEEE
"this game is addicting but i fucking hate flying missions in it  10/10 money, killing, robbing, driving"
Funny USA simulator. Online mode is def better than Rdr2 online.
very funny game to beat up your friends in
ธี่หยด
"story is 10/10, online is fun, w game."
Better don't  waste your time and money on this gave specifically ( GTA Online ) as it is full of cheaters and modders which will ruin your game play in every server that you join. When you finish important  mission or delivery they will find  way to either kick you out of the room or crash your game. Story is good but if you come for the Online better go somewhere else as it is visible that Rockstar has zero interest in fixing the 80% modder population which feels like kings in the game.
it is really fun and good and entertaining and good and fun and funny and cool and fun and entertaining
love shooting people
"To start, I'll say this: my whole life, I've always wanted to play this. For real, that is. After all, nearly every person I knew had played it. We had it on the Xbox 360 when I was younger, and I remember I used to sneak on it, before hearing a parent coming close to the room... so I quickly exited and booted up Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga. They knew something was up, as every time they came in, I was on the title screen.  Anyway, several years later, and I've finally played through the entire story. It went by about as quick as a breeze, not because it's short--if anything, it's a decently long story--but because it was so fun. Usually every game has at least one mission that is extremely annoying, just because it's no fun to do - but this game was a gem. And if there's anything Grand Theft Auto has taught me about gems... ...it's a steal."
cant wait for gta six
SHIT ASS GAME ONLINE IS PRACTICALLY UNPLAYABLE  . THIS GAME BY FAR HAS THE WORST ANTI CHEAT. . I hate that PC gets blamed for the cheaters when its always been rockstars fault. ive put almost 2k hours in this game. IMAGINE MAKING BILLIONS ON A GAME AND NEVER SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY THAT PUT YOU WHERE YOU ARE.
systummmmm
"game co chieu sau, vui nhung ma co che di chuyen ngu qua"
"One Word,AMAZING"
It's fun to play with cheat codes turned on. No dying.
TERRORISM IF IT WAS A GAME
i love the shoe store 10/10
supe5r cool g4am3 br0 def rcommend man supa cool
its very realistic
very good shit
would be better if i could transfer my ps4 account

"My friend who I play CS 2 with said if I post a review on GTA5, and it gets 166 exactly likes and 166 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 4090 and 1 Kilo of Lemon plus the upcoming GTA6. So im just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha :("

好评给这个游戏 一句傻逼送给r星  Praise to this game And Fuck rockstar
really fun game shesh
its the best cock seller on the market
Really Very Addictive Game Once you start playing you can't leave
"Used to play on xbox and servers were pretty good. Pc servers are trash and filled with modders. I had my feet randomly explode, up and atomizer shots rain from the sky, the entire lobby teleported to one spot on map, players that are invincible with indestructible vehicles, and constant spam to dupe cars or sell money. It makes it nearly impossible to progress in any way. On top of that going into business consistently gives me a black screen that never loads up and I have had multiple disconnects. Its a pretty new game though so hopefully they will get this stuff sorted out in the future....."
otimo jogo
every time i try do a heist it gives me an inifinite sky loading screen and no its not a problem with my network.
i got back into this game for about a week and nothing but annoying modders that keep fucking booting you off the game or some shit. this game has turned to absolute garbage. it isn't even fun to play anymore
kinda gets boring after a while but its really good and quality made
One of the best games frfr
its amazing game kinda fun and super fun with friends
good as fuck
VERY GOOD AND FUN KEEPS ADDING TO THE GAME
pro car stealing game would recommend (there's more than car stealing)
Worrth it
j like gta5
literally made me rage at my friend
Good decent game
I liked the graphics animation models audios everything i would recommend for other gamers there is one problem for me though when i am driving too fast the map loading cant keep up to me so i am stuttering alot and it is annoyiing idk if its because of my pc spec if i stay its just smooth then driving boom lag
vERI guD
its cool af
its gta duh
"Good game, bad launcher. I can't play GTA 5 Storymode without Wifi, which makes 0 sense considering it's singleplayer. I bought the game, let me play it."
"I shot half the city, running away from the police. After I hid, I went home and started playing GTA, everything suits me"
The best open world game for me!!
"my favourite game, strongly recommend to my friend to play it"
suck it plz daddy
good game. Hope gta 6 is the same or better
"Where I've successfully built a criminal empire, but my character still can't figure out how to swim without panicking. Apparently, being a criminal genius doesn't come with a free swimming lesson. And can we talk about the fact that my character can eat 20 hotdogs in a row and still maintain the athleticism of an Olympic sprinter? Fitness goals, Los Santos style!"
man this game sucks
good game for open world game lover but if u have low buget pc so u got leg
"i would say this game is good. but there's few bugs that i've been discovered in gta online. when i start cayo perico quick join, i dont see the ui of the kosaksta and just seeing clouds from top. after i do cayo perico, there's many things that i cant do on it. i cant cut picture, grab gold, and keycard. that made me frustated like i cant do anything for i dont know how long does the bug takes my time. i dont know why that happened, either im lagging or the is just unplayable when u doing heist"
ITS VERY GOOD
GTA 6 lil kid
trevor is my man
"Very laggy, too many hackers online, can't even start it sometimes and I have over the recommended stuff to play it. Story is good though."
best game out there
"game played great for one day, froze, and now just gives me a ""game is already running"" error message. Uninstalled/Reinstalled rockstar launcher and entire game and still the same error message."
it is best game
i  hope i get to see blizzard file for bankruptcy one day
it's alright
"Too many hackers, story is amazing but they dont care about the game anymore"
"It's very fun, Definetly worth the 90 dollars!"
always lagg
game hebat
Great game. GTA V is exactly as you'd expect it to be. Not suitable for all audiences.
i like vice city games
great game.
very good game i rate it 8/10
"Extremely horrible!!!!!!!!!, cant even load into the game neither opening the game, struggled extremely badly and spend 14 hours in the whole same day and still didn't work.  Dont buy this game!!!!!"
now its not running on my pc
very good game.
me blow things up
"Good game, just wish they didn't remove a bunch of cars from online"
amazing game ever i played
I would rather free fall from the twin fucking towers 10 times over then play another minute of this garbage excuse for a game.
damn fire this is good  butGTA 6 will be enven better but our potato pc wont handit it
ighij

"Trash Online, avoid"
THIS GAME IS VERY AMAZING AND BEST
just looking like a wowww
idc
its easy to play and understand the tactics of it
yes very good
An extremely great game. Truly still stands now in 2023.
"Well, what can I say about GTA V, if not GTA V Online, which is the one I've played the most and will mention. Well, it's riddled with issues in various ways, to the point where the game is flooded with hackers everywhere. You really feel absolutely nothing when conquering a yacht or a mansion; the game is so saturated with hackers that everyone has everything, and public sessions are complete chaos. And seriously, it's no joke how many hackers there are. The other day, they put me inside a container, and I had to leave the session because I couldn't escape; the hacker kept forcing me into that container. So, reconsider spending your money on this game if you're only going to play online; it's really not worth it. Now, the story mode, on the other hand, is worth it. It doesn't have the limitations of online and even features animals and a whole living universe, unlike online. So, that's it; grab it on sale, have fun, and please, don't use hack in this game."
GOT THE Game on xmas and it is fun
best game ever for ME!!!!
one of the greatest games ever  great story great game play great graphics great replay  just wish single player got more updates not just online gta rp is even  fun to watch and take part in
Pleasant.
Jättebra
Yk its GTA 5 one of the best game in the world even in 2023 so I dont have words for this masterpiece
"Account stolen by hackers, game ran rampant with modders and hackers. doesnt even let you make a new Rockstar account to play when your account gets taken."
i shoot :D
A great open games
lots of modders if u play on pc but otherwise very fun game unless u get raped very many times by modders and its a very fun game but if u get killed by modder or disconeected by modder its very doo doo not fun game so be careful for modders and one more thing modders suck and gay so dont die to modders or annoying and not fun.
sadfdsfhgdfsghjfdgdsdfhsfh its a good game
I love this game it tickles my lemons its so good i recomend to the bald people out thre
gta 6 when
this game is bad and i will not recommend it to others who wish to purchase
This videogame indeed makes me violent
super epic gaem
b ooopoooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
pretty fun game tbh but multiplayer is straight dead
good game lots of hackers
I co-op with friends on this game. Online is a joke due to cheaters and rockstar removing 95% of the core parts of anticheat.
IT GOOD BUY PLEASE
swag
"Update: GTA Online on PC is absolute trash and full of hackers. If you report them the report is actually sent from their PC, which their mod menu detects, blocks it and makes everyone in the session unable to do anything (""You invited you to your own apartment"" screen and so ow or they just make you unable to move and blow everyone up)  And then they make you a target and keep messing up the following sessions you join.  What a poop show Rockstar.   Good game, but clearly designed as controller first, the aircraft controls are horrible on PC compared to other games. There should have been fast travel to properties player owns around the map (apart from changing spawn location and restarting session as work around). Driving to properties on other side of the map simply to check supplies/start a mission is a huge waste of  collective human hours. The session management also wastes a lot of time in loading screen/sending people from crew/friends sessions to public sessions after each mission. Rockstar must've done it to increase active game time to show for stats $. Hope this changes in GTA VI."

"My friend I play with said that if I post a review about the game and it gets 200 likes and 50 rewards, he'll buy me a bag of chips and a RTX 4090. So I'll leave this here."
fuck this
GTAV has everyone has heard about lives up to the standard that the community gives it.
GOOD GAME :)
It's worth it. Just buy it.
i like it worth my 15 bucks
ta bueno
I do like this game all in all man but the one problem is the amount of hackers in this game all I'm saying is that ROCKSTAR needs a better anti cheat.
guud gayme
"If you want to be able to play this game, play story-mode or in a private server, since you will most likely end up getting hacked or griefed by a modder if you play on a public server. The game itself is fun, it's grindy as fuck in online, but fun. (I've been playing it on Xbox for years.) But yeah... I can't bring myself to recommend a game that might get you hacked, so until Rockstar fixes their problems I can't recommend this. And yes, I got kicked out of the game by a hacker/modder just before writing this."
"my favorite part of this game is the shoe store, such a variety of shoes, my favorite are the white shoes but if you prefer the black shoes that's okay too. in fact you can like any type of shoes and nobody is to judge you. you can even enjoy boots instead and whos to say otherwise? unless you like to walk around bare foot, then you disgust me."
why is franklin black?????????
its GTA what else is there to say.
We all know its worth it
got corseted by oppressors as a lvl 8 dont cop
"All about money !!! Bought the game with start up pack and in game cash. Cant even acces to it. activation code dont work even tho it clearly shows that the pack is dowloaded and ready to access. too much information needed for them to help you or they send you straight to the Q&A that clearly does not satisfy the client with their satisfaction rate. In other words, its what called a scam !!"
hay :D
Grab That Auto 5 >>>>
Micheal looks like Frank West
"Game was fun, but my Buffalo that I customized the shit out of (my personal vehicle) is gone and I can't find it :'("
Time flies by in GTA
the best part is when you fly a plane into a tall building
HSHSHSHSH
Very fun to commit crime
"dlc not working?? wheres my 1,000,000?? :^("
The RP is what makes this game fun.
Story is better than most movies now a days
its swesome
Not enough sex
good online roplay
piece of art
"Imagine buying a steam deck to specifcally play this game offline, you already paid rockstar+steam, and now you have to pirate the fucking game because 'it requires activation' from rockstars servers. fuuuuuuck you. Im stealing gta6 to compensate for your nonsense"
sad
yes because it is very fun but it is hard to get away from cops and the thing i hate about this game is how you have to call to get your car back it is very annoying i also dislike how people just spwan kill you
GOOD VERY YES GAME
"Yes, very good."
a big booty black man came and kept raping me. i hate big booty black men
"Great game, amazing gameplay, story line 10/10"

this game has the best story i have ever played. The story is just so well made the characters you play as have there own special abilitys which make the game intersting and apart from others. The online as much grifers and modders theres in online is still really good part of the game and super fun.
honry makes me cum
"Terrible game, didn't even play for an hour"
It has a really good story mode and the online game is really fun with friends the only thing that is bad about it is that there are a lot of hackers

Great game!
this game is very good for children under 5
cooll game
Very fun and amzaing also if you buy crimnal enterprise off steam you have to wait about a day or 2 for you to get your stuff
"8/10  This is a very iconic game. The characters are lovable and they elevate the experience (Franklin is the best, Fight me.)  The story represents how corrupt and sad our current society is.   Pacing can be slow at times but it's overall a good experience.  Gun fights are very intense and fun.  I recommend this game if you like open world exploring and/or action adventure games."
I love the game
"very good and fun game, especially the online"
great game and runs so smoothly!  Just update your game and put nice and cool shoes like dunks and air forces and air jordans  and some new cars like GTR Lamborghini and other cool drifting cars.
Kool
Don't have much to say...
g00d
umb
top 10 games off all time
"man the game is great, but this fucking Rockstar launcher is just killing me, errors, bugs, not compatible with mods, etc. fuck you rockstar with your launcher."
"wonderful game to play with friends, offers a great story mode and is overall one of the best games to play whenever you are bored."
GTA 6 when
It's fun.  Custom cars for the win.
"Love the story mode, but online has got no life."
"FUN, i enjoy punching strangers"
"Very gamer bang bang, money for car go brrrrrr."
"Everyone knows this is a great game, but it's more than that on PC. This is one of the most optimized games I've ever played. I have an old computer with just a 1080Ti in it, and it ran this at almost max specs at 60fps. It's incredible. Why can't all PC releases be optimized and coded like this? Amazing job by Rockstar and Take2."
game not working wont load
Great game. Just release GTA 6 Already
i love going to the shoe shop and buy them new jordans
the game is fun
game is shit
GOOD UNTIL SIX
"I would NOT recommend this game for new players unless you're gonna do story mode. if you're gonna do online, be prepared for the oppressor players and hackers. the dlcs in online are great but i would highly recommend getting friends to do it with since randoms are almost always a POS. also would recommend getting versions of the game where you start out with a lot of money so that you can actually have a chance of winning against oppressor players who sit in they moms basement jobless"
fun game but if u have a bad PC dont get it
wow online is just so anti-player isn't it
long sclong
toxic
"i was in a special cargo mission in online as a ceo yea, and it says kill two hobos i say to the game ""which TWO are the HOBOS?"" it is the dead of night in game and i cant see and the hobos dont even look like hobos they look like regular ass people make it a little easier to see that they are hobos you tosser"
"Just a reminder that the source code for GTAV has been leaked. If there are any vulnerabilties/bugs that grant access to your computer, the hacker community has them. Hackers could already access private lobbies before this, so going invite only won't help you."
i can steal and drive
"Runs better on my pc than on my ps5, great purchase!"
Its fun for PC
This game was very fun!
loads are long
HELLO
ah yes crime
jes
really good OG game
"I've played exclusively GTA Online. I'm not terribly good at it. And some people use mods to cheat. Even so, I find it a fun game to play from time to time. Some days if I want to relax and take my aggression out, I hop on the train and ride around one of the flatter bed cars, take cover on the side and start shooting whatever that moves. Do it well enough and you get to shoot helicopters. Pretty fun. Definitely mature audiences only, of course."
Nunni paad game!!!!!!!!!
banging
"I played this game for first time... and it was on Steam Deck, i didnt know it will need other launcher and internet connection to start the game, ngl this was pretty anoying to create account in RockStar launcher to download it and to do everything on my Steam Deck without wireless keyboard and mouse it was pretty shit, even few times cannot type on the virtual keyboard and so on ... at the end everything sets like magic after struggling lol... dont understand why also need internet , because i dont play online mode i play story mode ... well after all set up the game looks pretty good and the fps its almost always 60 which is perfect. I will recommend this game on Steam Deck even though all this shits i mention, because the game its pretty fun to play even just to drive car, run from police or listening music and chilling. But keep in mind i have around 10 hrs in the game and the game [u]FREEZES 2-3 times so i need to hard reset.[/u] I didnt expirience this with other games till now."
"extremely good game, i  just wish there was a tutorial from where different missions are"
BUGS AND HACKERS ARE LEADING ONLINE VERSION OF GTA5
Best stinky boy <3
i like trevors hairline
Haven't played GTA in years. Great story to get back into it!
i do not fear the source code hackers
thank you rockstar for not letting me transfer my ps4 online characters to pc it made me realize i should play a game that doesnt make me actively hate myself also your story mode is dogshit
"I give modders 6 months with the source code before online is completely unplayable and infested with mods and crypto mining servers.  If it wasn't unplayable already, it'll honestly be a data protection risk come 2024.  I'd say stick to single player or the thousands of mods for it that you'll pretty much never run out of stuff to do. Or risk having your computer filled with spyware online, up to you."
good open world game
"Rockstar is really milking this game dry, don't know why i played this game for 235 hours."
i love the customisation. If you go to the shoe icon in lower part of the map you can find my fav shop. i rlly love going there and looking at the pretty shoes
good game have big money 3 hours
fun to run over people i have 10+ hours and i got this game 2 days ago
cheaters do your head in but its ok
bla
I love to run over people on the sidewalks :3
"I'm replaying the story for the first time in 10 years and boy did it hold up. What a great game. I'm not so interested in the online aspect as I used to be. I'm excited for GTA 6. If GTA 5 and RDR2 are any indication to the well told story that's going to come out of their next installment, I'm more than happy to pay up when the game finally comes out. I never thought I'd be into singleplayer games as much as I 'am today. It almost feels like I'm playing this story for the first time."
good #
"VERY GOOD GAME, loved the missions cause almost every single one is unique or atleast different in its own way and man that ending had me almost teared up. still a great game. i will be continuing on to online to maybe get some more story? (I hope)   2 more years and we'll finally have GTA 6 and i hope packie will be there too"
i bought this game finally after turning 13 wooo
a lot of hackers but good game
funny strippers hehe
I liked the cars
IT IS JUST WONDERFUL
VERY FUN AND COMPETITIVE. bEAUTIFUL CARS!
WHY CANT I BUY GTA V WITHOUT PAYING FOR PREMIUM EDITION?
The best open world game I have played. Rockstar Games never disappoints us when it comes to gameplay and graphics. LOVED this game.
really really really goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood gammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmme

"Great on steam deck, both without and with keyboard and mouse."
WHO CANT WAIT FOR GTA 6!!!!

Good Jame
modders love watching their mom get railed
this game will give you trust issues in the online mode
finally after years and years of waiting to have this game comes to an end today will be my happiest day ever i cannot forget the day i bought his game 12/28/23
"the snow is the second worst idea to plague the map for three months at a time, only behind making the game already so un-enjoyable to play that you are 'tempted' to pay for money instead of earning it through playing the 'fun' game"
being blow up by Chinese wizards are fun
Best game ever but still waiting for gta 6

"good game, that is all i can say, but multiplayer only fun when you play with friend, don't try to pay alone on online gta, you gonna got abuse to death"
Noice
"Good Game, but we need GTA6 now ffs."
Epic game. The story is good and the online mode is epic. If you know what to do you will be having a lot of fun
waiting on gta 6:/
It's the best what can I say other than its so much fun.

Intersting game. Very fun.
"me and my friends beat each other up and then jug pulls out a laser minigun and causes havoc, he gets robbed by the grooch, then the grooch is shot and killed, then generic gets a jamacian helicopter lady to fly us to a yeti, i kill it but my friends couldn't see them so they think im a schizo, i skin the yeti and wear its skin, then we kill people and get 5 stars and then generic becomes invincible and can jump really high, in under my first 5 hours of this game, very fun would recommend"

"Its GTA what can I say, wish it was crossplay but understand why its not."
wheres red dead red dead redemption 3?
GOOD.
this game is ever good and fun plz play and pay
"Sure they'll happily patch the game for money glitches and sell you shark cards, but in the decade that this game has been out online matchmaking has never been fixed.

Too difficult to figure out how to play actually decent online servers. I had to like install seperate programs or something and I still couldnt find good online servers.
nice game fun with friends
stripper titties blocky as fuck but the game came out 10 years ago so I wont complain that much
;love the game recommend using a controller
The support service replied that the activation code can only be used once and in the end I lost my account. I don't recommend it.
"If you have a genuinely shit laptop or pc, This game is definitely a loading screen simulator,"
Excellent!

10 years... GTA6
very goood fucking game
GG this Game Always on Top

GOOD GAME VERY NICE STORY
very funny game
"Great game but rockstar needs to update PC to next gen. There is no good reason besides greed that PC players can not have Hao's workshop and other such ""next gen"" features. There would be no problem porting all of those features, and I'm fairly sure mod clients for RP servers already have them. Update the damn game."
"Lots of modded modes, make the game better in my opinion."

"Plagued with hackers in every lobby now. But it's fine as long as Rockstar focuses on what's important, DLC."

very nice and gay
its super fun to play story mode and online
it doesnt need a review
The most fun I've ever had on a game
This is my second account for GTA. In total i have a little over 95 ~ 100 hours of straight game play. My opinion this game is one of the best. I've been playing on other accounts on Xbox and PS4 in total over 400+ hours and around 2 ~ 3 years of playing. Even tho i'm not from the start of when this game first game out i must say i love it.

"Jesus F*cking Christ the solo missions in this game for online are impossible and require a google search to even have a shot at figuring out what kind of stupid roundabout way of doing things the missions wants you to do. Only play story mode. Stay away from online unless you're messing around with friends. If you're looking to play a game for fun or to relax, steer clear. The mechanics and missions are that frustrating."
"its goud   ,3"
Just under 1000 hours in game. fun with friends. griefers make it hard to like sometimes but mostly a positive experience

"This game features a ton of content, such as committing crimes, customizing your own vehicles, purchasing properties, and managing your own business. Overall, it's a great game."
"I don't like the game, but I love that amazing and beauty place (you know what place It's)"
yeeees
"How long do you think you were playing? One hour? Two Hours? Wrong, 10 Hours. This game will suck away every second of your life. Definitely recommend (note if you leave to take a shower, eat, drink, use the restroom, or have a casual conversation you will be kicked for being AFK)."
"Story: worth original price, why are you still looking at reviews here? Online: have no experience, abstaining from commenting  Who the fakk is still buying this? We need GTA 6!"
brain rot. Absolute brain rot. love it
i like the game i dislike hackers
franklin is funny as a bitch bro

It's very fun
"haha funny 69 hours, ive been r*ped by 300 modders."
"cant wait for gta 6 to have flying vehicles and non realistic guns :D grand theft trash online. On par with saints row, dumpster fire games built for the young generations. this game was good until that shit was added and is no longer realistic."
I think its a very fun game
It's fun
it sucks

"Hello, ladies and gentlemen. GTA V (Grand theft auto V) is a great game. It's fun, the story is fun.   The online aspect does have it's downlows, but it's still very fun to play it. It doesn't get boring at all.  I don't play it anymore at all, but it's still the best Grand Theft Auto game of the series."

"Online is bad. Play FiveM instead Story will always remain a masterpiece But Rockstar,please don't delay GTA VI"
i have played this game since it came out and i am staring from the beginning i forgot how long it can take to level up online after level 60 now at level 76 and 101 hours i Wish STEAM would put days next to hours played but i dont know anyone working there to get it done since putting a suggestion does not mean jack so if someone could help me out it would be nice.
hehehe hah
Great game to buy for the 7th time.
IT IS GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I mostly use FiveM/Roleplaying servers but the game is fun
Loved It.
they hacked my rockstar account that was linked to epic games and somehow its linked here too so now i cant ever play gta
Awesome game for real. I've got to play this game after 10 years.

fack yes
For online my mechanic has been bugged and I cant spawn in vehicles and when I attempt to the menu gets stuck on my screen. Me and my friends bet on how many modders we get on servers we join. Recently it feels like game is 100% neglected and crashing happens so often game is nearly unplayable.  Rockstar has gave up on GTAV completely. Just wait for GTAVI to come out.
Wheres the Expanded & Enhanced edition update?  cheaters litter the online experience  single play is good tho
certainly one of the games of all time
It was the best selling GTA game ever for a reason.
Posso saltare i dialoghi grazie

I cant even play this stupid fucking game
"I like the free roam ability of games like this and the possibility of trying to find something the programmers have missed, though grief bringers are a pain and insult to their mothers"
you can run over pedestrians
The perfect game. No other explanation since this game is 10 years old now and everyone knows about it.
"Turns out if you  dont't remember your Rockstar Online information, theres no way to play the game. Even if you offer for them to take it out of your library, and to pay full price for it again.  Both Steam and Rockstar have been extremely unhelpful. Now I'm stuck with a copy of this game thats literally unplayable."
To many Modders first time going in a public lobby a Modder gave me a whole bunch of money Contacted rockstar and they still havent removed it and i havent gotten a response from them

GTA 5 is just GTA 5... perfect if we discount the multiplayer.

"Played this a ton, great game. Don't purchase it unless you want to play online, pirating the game is more convenient. Rockstar will not let you play the game without first creating a social club account and then entering an activation code. If you can get Rockstar to accept the activation code it gives you when you buy the game, you're a smarter lady than I am."
yummers
gta5 is the best it is fun you can meet new people i recommend
Obviously That's The best Game Ever Released
"Story: Compelling and intricate. A blessing to experience with lessons from a gritty, grim depiction of the West of Western culture.  Online: Was once a great game to play with friends and charade with randoms... but this is the PC port. Total cash-grab pricing of in-game multiplayer content turned it into 1930s German economy simulator where they prompt you to ask your wallet for permission to buy the most overrated possessions known to man -- *Virtual vehicles*  A curse no doubt conjured by the Rockstar North corporate bean-counters that analyzed the profit of holiday and birthday gift revenue coming from these aforementioned dream vehicles back in 2014. It was when missions paid a Nth of any purchasable in-game content. The grind was not worth it even when the prices mirrored the real world's retail prices of cars and weapons. Punks with dough to spend and hackers were swift to drop in and find ways to accumulate in-game currency without grindy gameplay. The well was poisoned before the water had time to collect at the bottom."
puta mare
I'm typing this cos i don't wanna see that little message (you've played 12.5 hours would you recommend this game to other players) so i would and that all now i don't need to see that message.

Good enough
"Gather your friends for an exciting GTA V experience! But, caution! if you're playing solo - GTA Online has lots of hackers. Main Recommendation: Consider trying out ""GRAND RP,"" a cutting-edge server for GTA. It's a blacklist server, but it's way ahead of its time. Boasts a dedicated team of admins ensuring a great gameplay and roleplay experience. Make new friends and receive cool goodies regularly from the game administration. Conclusion: Some outcomes of my experience - For a better, safer, and more enjoyable time in GTA, give GRAND RP a shot! - It's a standout choice for those looking for quality roleplay and a hacker-free environment."

"Really fun game running over motorcyclists with a car, also spent 10 hours doing it. :steamhappy:"
"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) is an absolute masterpiece that continues to captivate players with its unparalleled open-world experience, dynamic characters, and immersive gameplay. Released in 2013, the game has stood the test of time and remains a shining example of what an open-world action-adventure game can achieve.  One of the most impressive aspects of GTA 5 is its vast and meticulously crafted open world, the fictional state of San Andreas. The attention to detail is extraordinary, with a diverse range of landscapes, from bustling urban environments to serene countryside and picturesque coastal areas. The level of detail in the game world is staggering, and it creates an incredibly immersive experience for players.  The game features three playable protagonists—Michael, Trevor, and Franklin—each with their own distinct personality, background, and set of skills. This innovative approach to storytelling adds depth to the narrative and allows players to experience the storyline from multiple perspectives. The character development is exceptional, and the writing is top-notch, making each protagonist memorable in their own right.  GTA 5 excels in offering a wide variety of activities beyond the main storyline. From adrenaline-pumping heists and thrilling car chases to golf, tennis, and base jumping, the game provides an extensive range of diversions to keep players engaged for hours on end. The attention to detail extends to the side missions and activities, making them just as enjoyable as the main storyline.  The game's graphics and attention to realism are outstanding, even years after its initial release. The level of detail in the character models, vehicles, and environments is remarkable, and the game's lighting effects contribute to a visually stunning experience.  Furthermore, GTA Online, the multiplayer component of GTA 5, adds another layer of longevity to the game. With a vast open world to explore, cooperative and competitive missions, and a constant stream of updates and new content, GTA Online provides endless hours of entertainment for players.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a landmark achievement in the gaming industry. Its combination of a richly detailed open world, compelling characters, engaging storyline, and diverse gameplay options make it a must-play for any fan of the action-adventure genre. Even years after its release, GTA 5 continues to be a shining example of the incredible potential of video games as an art form and entertainment medium."
It won't let me load in
Best open world and story game. GTA V by  R*
play gta online trust me
but my money is lost
best hai bhai . i use to play gta san andreas on my pc but after the release of gta 6 trailer i wanted to play gta 5 so i bought it with my savings and thanks to steam that they reduced gta 5 price and i will never regret that i spent my 900 rs on a game
It's just a really fun game
"u should buy if u still don't own u r dumba** , GOOOO Buy right now GTA 6 IS Coming Boys"
cuc ki dam!!!
wow very cool

hackers...
Came here to watch Lamar roast Franklin   10/10 game
"good game , waiting for next update"
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
My friend bully me very bad *cry emoji*
"Not only has this game resulted in the life-long arrest of an autistic person that has never hurt anybody or intended to hurt anybody, but it also locked me out because you need a rockstar account and can't login with your steam account. I forgot the password and no longer have access to the gmail account linked to it. There's also the fact that Rockstar has absolutely RUINED GTA online by implementing pay to win aspects with overpowered vehicles that are obtained by, you guessed it, in-game money that can be bought with real life money. The only reason they never do anything about it is because having these overpowered vehicles create incentive for people to purchase those vehicles to fight against people who already have those vehicles, but what do you know, these vehicles are fucking expensive so you can either grind for these vehicles or purchase money for these vehicles. This is only made worse by the fact most of the content in GTA online costs a metric fuck ton of in-game money so you can't really have fun without investing into rockstar's most disliked industry or by spending litteral days just to afford to purchase a random fucking building to start the content chain. The grinding is made worse only by the fact that while you grind, you get called and texted by in game characters advertising the content you can't afford and the devs will constantly create more content that you can't afford."
Honestly pretty good
this shi fun
"honest to god, sometimes its equivalent to hot sex"
if ur game doesnt crash then gud game
Very fun and a classic game!
its grand theft auto the only game where you can play hatred notimportant and get sexy cars that arent just police cars
this  is such a fun game 10/10 wou;d recomend
Still the king
i have almost 1500 hours on xbox but i only go on pc to play mods. the mods were cool so this game is cool.
pretty good aside from being 110gb but dont need the fastest pc or laptop to run this
not crazy bout pc version but on console next gen for sure is my favourite
Amazing story. Amazing graphics. Super fun multiplayer. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME AS ALWAYS SINCE ITS NOSTALGIC AND IM A BILLIONAIRE NOW SINCE IM IN THE GRIND!!!
i went to the strip club highly recomend
"Rockstar requires that Social club is linked to Steam which seems like it shouldn't be an issue, unless like me, the Rockstar launcher is saying that an account with an email I've never made nor seen in my life is linked to the account. They won't let a new social club account sign in because it is not linked to Steam. I assume they did this to ensure I paid for the game, but the fact that I can launch from Steam should be proof enough. This is highly unethical. I've played tons of other games with their own launchers and they all let you switch to a different/new account you created after launching through Steam. I'm essentially out of my money or stuck playing offline which is not part of the original purchase agreement.   You pay for a game believing the multiplayer will work seamlessly and when it doesn't it feels like you've been scammed because you have been. Just pirate this game. I shouldn't have to look up guides, read Reddit posts, or talk to support just to get a product I purchased working. The process to recover this account is highly convoluted and the Rockstar website won't even allow me to sign in under the new account I made to contact support even though I verified my account and everything. Why even spend the money for a headache just take to the seas.  Edit  I was wrong I can't even play offline since that requires you to sign in too. Instead of launching offline it just gives an error since the Rockstar launcher doesn't work without wifi. I've literally been scammed by a AAA game company insane."
Franklin is black   :(
"Can't run the game when I bought it, so I returned it."
To meany cheaters and moders ruining online lobbys and there is no friend party system.
The GTAO hackers are so bad they managed to rip my social club account from under me and I have no way to access the game I payed for anymore. Thanks Rockstar!
shit gas
THIS GAME AWESOME
Even after 10 years this game look fresh and new. Really liked the single player mode
the diamond casino did not stand a chance
Still fun to play with friends!
Award this for no reason.
"I've had problems with this game, I didn't like it very much at launch: gameplay felt weird, I didn't like the characters, etc. Now that I've been playing all 3D GTA games in order, I can better appreciate the evolution of the series. This is the best GTA has played and looked ever, so much so I'd be tempted to play it all again if it weren't for GTA Online...  I'm gonna be honest, at first I was so frustrated with the GTA Online I left a negative review. I felt the game was constantly fucking me over and wasting my time. It's a rough start, but if you can survive that the game starts to feel rewarding. It's grindy though, be prepared to do the same things over and over again. Story is mainly locked behind end-game content: businesses costing millions and so on. But there are some pretty nice returns of characters from the main game here and there. GTA Online is like crack: you know it's bad for you, but you can't stop taking it."
BEST GAME EVA
Rockstar seems like a cool dude...
Got it on sale and it's as good as ever.
BOOMBOOM
worth every penny
gooooooooooddd
fun ash especially wit friends
"Let me sum this up by saying the following: Base Game: Reccomended      This is a classic hit by R* for all to enjoy, just like the rest of the GTA Library Online Play: Not Reccomended      This is a mobile game disguised as a GTA online experience, yes I was suckered into it back in 2015 as well, for the short time I had friends...  -who played it too. Any new expansion that comes out to get you to pay for shark cards is an easy way to make money when all they need to do is add an OP car and a plethora of shitty by comparison cars, all too expensive for their own good. Avoid this game if you want to keep your salary or your job. R* knows you'll lose one or the other playing.  And... sure, it might be a great experience now, but the point is, don't pay for shark cards."
y good game
yof

"Take everything with a grain of salt, and have fun, go in knowing everything you sell and do can be ruined and it seems to not ruin your day, solo cayo perico is the easist but a grindy way to make millions, and fun tip buy lots of garages and all the garage levels from the arcade ad keep all your cars youll end up regretting sellling them and you always lose money on them so no reason to go down the rabbit hole of desperation for a new mediocre car"

"Yes, for the $10 I paid for it, but it's a very flawed game, and a sign of the low standards of gaming today.  This one is by far the best GTA yet, and also still shows their failings in knowing how to advance the series. This game, like all GTA games is a fun chaos simulator. When the game tries to be serious, the flawed mechanics are obvious. It's clear Rockstar has no intention of improving them much.  The first thing I noticed is Rockstar doesn't respect their players. This was a single player series that now focuses on multi-player, and the single player game is hurt for it. The fact that different gen consoles got more/less content is also an insult to customers.   The city is by far the best they've done yet. It's vast, and beautiful, and very well realized. I love driving around in it. It's added by the fact that you can put your own music in the radio. That's something that should be a standard today. The commercials they add really make it better.   The story, and three protag concept is cool, and it works very well. I can't say I care for it, or the characters. These have never been why I played GTA in the first place. The constant bickering just wears thin far too fast.  I like the arcade feeling of the driving in this over the fish tailing of GTA 4's cars. Motorcycles are actually usable again.   Sadly, there's just so many problems with this game.  First, the game is not optimized well. On a 3070 running 1080p at 60 fps, I had to turn MXAA off to get over 30fps. It held a solid 60 until I went underwater. It would sit around 15fps underwater. This is just terrible. The standards of poor games people accept today just makes me sad.  The whole structure of the game is poor. If you want any chance of making money, you have to do the story first. What little reward there is to having all that money, is just planes and helicopters that can't really be used as all the meaningful gameplay is gone. Businesses have such a poor Return Of Investment, you'll be waiting forever for them to pay off. Cars are absolutely worthless except to look at in story mode. If you buy them, they can disappear in seconds. you can't use them in most missions because Rockstar has once again failed to innovate on their lazy programming. You go out of your way to grind money for a car, take it to a mission...and once again they stick you with the shittiest car because they don't understand how to make a game difficult. Therefore, there's no point to going after money or vehicles. In multi-player, your cars get saved. Not in story mode, because they don't care about it. They specifically devalue their own product. This is the same thing they do in Max Payne 3, where he constantly throws away machine guns to pull out a pistol. That shit's just amateur hour.  The mission structure often fails as they stick you in a position where Michael drives, and Franklin shoots. They put the characters in positions where their abilities aren't useful. This makes meaningful gameplay hard, as the game is catered against it's strengths. When I picked ending C, they disable sprint in the firefight...yep. They're that desperate to fake difficulty.  Collision physics are inconsistent. You don't know what will stop you dead, or get knocked over. This wasn't as big of a problem  in past games.  The hidden packages don't appear unless you save and reload the game. They don't tell you this, and they actually patched this is in.    The AI is dumb, and often drives right into you.  The police come when you punch someone out in the middle of nowhere....because birds call them (not a joke.) Artificial difficulty is lazy work. Yes, it's easy to lose them...but it becomes tedious time consumption for no reason. The police are very inconsistent. Sometimes a one star level takes minutes, while a two star level takes seconds to lose. They're not difficult, just annoying."
Awful~nonexistent customer support from both Rockstar Games and Steam. Game will not launch on computer.

La verdad opino que este juego es bastante caotico y crea una desensibilizacion de la violencia a los niños de poca edad que son los principales promotores del videojuego
Best Game I ever Play
this game fun if playing with friends
da best
"I’ve had this game on 3 platforms now, PS3, PS4, & PC, and it’s just as fun now as it was when I first got it 10 years ago.  Playing the story is fun and playing online with friends is always a blast especially when they don’t live close by or are out of state, it’s a good way to hang out."
sdfs
"Its gta, so its always great..."
muy bien make me bust
BEST GAME EVER!!!
"Do I really need to say anything? Incredible game. Story is really fun to play through, although many cheaters in online, and some really bad cheaters too. The game is really fun going back to play it to get all achievements before GTAVI comes out :)"
very gud game yes
I LOVEEEE THIS GAMEEEEEEEEEEEEE
"[rpoerkfkgoretj,-9it"
"simply, amazing."
"Rich ingame, Broke inlife"
"i really like this game, the only thing i dislike about it is that you cant play with xbox friends on console, so no crossplay. It sucks, and its about time rockstar added that."
"10/10 Game, but there is two critiques I could give. Having customization earlier before Level 6 and being able to change your heist crew. Otherwise very good game, very fun. Can't wait for GTA 6"
A bit stale
"10/10, i started playing 1 day ago and now some modder got me to rank 100"
1661 hours for what?
"A captivating experience with abundant activities; occasional fatigue sets in, yet a unique allure keeps drawing you back, unmatched by any other game."
"best game to release anger if  you mod it, if it wasnt for this game i would've broken my monitor allready"
"The Best Game I ever Played. The Game is So Old but still Graphics are so advance,"
"One of the best open world games out there which goes without saying. Gameplay is fantastic, story is engaging and graphics is really good for a decade old game. Rockstar is one the best video game creator out there right now."
great game very good i recommend it to every
i miss my wife trevor
please give me back my family

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) is an immensely popular video game known for its open-world gameplay, captivating storyline, and extensive multiplayer features. The game offers a vast and detailed virtual world to explore, allowing players to engage in thrilling missions, car chases, and heists. The pros of GTA 5 include its immersive and visually stunning graphics, diverse range of playable characters, and the freedom it grants players to navigate the virtual environment. The multiplayer component, GTA Online, offers an expansive multiplayer experience with numerous activities and missions. However, the game does have some cons to consider. It contains mature content and explicit violence, which may not be suitable for all players or age groups. Additionally, the game's size and complexity can be overwhelming for some, and it may require a significant time investment to fully explore and appreciate all its features. Overall, GTA 5 provides an expansive and immersive experience, but its mature content and complexity should be taken into account before"
kkk'
god gtame ggggggg
the best shooter ive ever played
Well made game
can wait for gta6 because ima be dead by then
story mode fun
"[h1] Awesome Game But Installation Nightmare [/h1]  This game is really fun and great and all, but was an installation nightmare for me. Fun story and open world so far! But be warned when trying to install, it may not go smoothly for everyone. Overall, if you're thinking of getting this game, it's worth it!  P.S. Rockstar Games please invest some time into fixing your poopy launcher, I shouldn't have to run things as administrator all the time or jump for 50 hoops just to get your launcher working. Please, yes? Thank you."
This game is perfect
it is a good g
"Took me 10 years (and 3 different gaming PCs) to finish the story, but it was worth it!"

hell yeah.
Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Price: Worth it || 10/10 Community: 6/10 Mods: 10/10  Total: 56/60 || A   Note #1: I've played GTA Online only for a total of 2 hours and have Rank 10/11 as of posting this review Note #2: It's MY opinion and you CAN'T change it :)
Grand Theft Auto is the only game truly worth more than $60
"Too lazy to write a review and this game is too popular for me to put in the effort to write one, anyways 10/10 psychopath/sociopath simulator. (wait, technically did i write a review, i just shot myself in the foot.)"
Its a good game. I like the GTA Online and my rp lv is 130 the game is so good that i can play 12hours straigth but if i will upgrade my pc the fps gets high and I can enjoy the game. I love GTA story mode and I finish the story 2-3times  I guess.            SO IF YOU SEE THIS I RECOMMEND TO BUY THIS GAME LETS ENJOY IT:)
gta 6
"Its GTA V, its a classic, buy it, but it normally goes on sale so look out for those,."

biggest GARBAGE game in existence. Everyone who plays this has 0 brain cells.
very succulent game just to many children with mod menus on gta online
My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on gtav and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.
"Ive had this game for 4 days. First time playing it in 2023. This is the best game Ive ever played, Ive spent hours just driving cars around and you can do whatever you want."
Used to play in PS4 and then switched to PC not that long ago and there is more to do on pc then there is on ps4
ots goodddddddddddddddddddd
You know why its  the best gta
trevor philips industries
Its disappointing to know Rockstar had plans to create single player DLC but instead choose to bloat GTA Online with content that barely fixes its biggest problems.
love the story mode. love the online experience!

"Lets starts, the game is a good game i had fun playing it but for some reason the game starting freezing for about 2-5 sec. and doesn't matter what i did the game didn't fixed itself. i spent hours on line tried to fix this problem but nothing.  i asking for a refund but told me that i have played a total of 9 hour i cant get a refund. this is very unfair due to it is a problem on the game side.   all in all it is a good game but this consent freezing makes the game unplayable."
this game is good but not for kids and it take to long to downlod
NICE JUST HAD THIS GAME AFTER LIKE 10 YEARS?
its was osm game
Banned for no reason after just 3 days

Just writing this review before GTA 6
expensive
"it is good, i bought it for just 600 rupees"
very naughty and thats not what santa approves!
I would recommend RTX. 3050. It will give you a better perfomance  And surely this game is. gonna fucking heat your RTX  of your laptop or PC.
hmmv very good
Id like the game more if these modders would stop giving me money and exp. Its not fun when i get everything off the bat like they try to do to me.
I flew a ufo and an oppressor
"Great game, just i bought the 8 Million dallar version, and didnt get my 8 Mill."

What else can i say? It's timeless. Over 10 years worth of memories. Returning in light of recent events...BRING ON GTA VI!!! 💰🚓
"GTA Online is the worst online multiplayer experience ever. It almost feels like a game such as GTA should never have online features. Half the time I feel like I was in a boring dream. Missions, heists, and what not take too long with redundant driving from one point to another and lack of vehicle spawn. If your chopper blows up in the middle of the desert, you're d o n e, fucked.   Yes, some deathmatches, races, and all that events can be fun, but if I wanted to play those game modes, I'd rather play other games. As for the heists, the thing that gets you a lot of money quicker, it's like being tortured more painful than when Trevor tortured that dude. For one, connection errors are more common to encounter than the actual players who are willing to join the heist. What worse is that once you've got some players ready, and you finally get to hear the mission instructions, your fellow crew mates would grief the fuck out of you with all that hack, trainer, or some shit. Sure, that sure sounds like fun. The heists/mission are very long with the long drive and thousands of npcs to be killed, so it makes sense if you need other players as they might help you travel faster and kill npcs faster. Truth is, you can't rely on other players for helping you because most likely they'd rather be trolls. I know I can play with friends and family, but they are smart enough to avoid this shit.  Money is important. So important that you need money to have fun in the game. Some missions/heists requires you to buy some properties. To earn money you should do contract mission or events. these contract missions/events don't even get you loads of cash. Meanwhile, the properties you need to buy are way too expensive. Luckily, these contract missions/event can be done in solo; however, even so, the missions are made for multiplayer so it takes so long. Wait, whats this? oh, you can buy money with money! That's right! You want to buy these in-game properties to enjoy the additional missions, but you don't like grinding for money because it's boring? Just give Rockstar your cash!  Seriously, I would prefer Rockstar to make dlc(s) to the main game for additional gameplay, stories, and in-game stuff than this online bullshit."
loading screen has boobies
it is so much fun
nah ragdolls are trashhhh... But its fun with mods
Game is good  Modders bad  Fuck Rockstar games
cool and awesome
nice game and nice graphic
vary good game
i lost all of my melanin and my brain cells because of this game
fuin
"recently bought this on steam after owning it on epic games and playing it on console, and it is still the same good GTA 5, with the same performance VS epic games launcher. The steam version is preferable because of RP software aswell. Now, getting into GTA online on PC, thats where it gets bad, the servers are just riddled with hackers and griefers, aswell as RDR2 Online servers. Anti cheat... anti cheat.... anti cheat.... please, get better anti cheat......"
lots of things to do. lots of fun
Good Yes
so hot

"Game won't even launch. Half the time the Rockstar launcher won't even open. When it does, it launches the game only to give me an error 1005 which I can't ever get past. I looked online everywhere and nothing helped, including uninstalling the game, uninstalling the Rockstar launcher. Complete waste of money, couldn't even play the game for a minute. Don't waste your time with this game or this company."

very good and   amazing game.
"This is one game which you can genuinely enjoy by yourself and with your friends, the shooting, racing, robberies, handling businesses, all of them in one game which makes it unique in itself. The story mode is also pretty engaging which allows players to dive into the world of organized crime and government authorities. Overall I would give it a solid 9 outta 10."
fun game love robbing peaple but still some bugs and when gta 6
this game is very very good
gta real

GTA 5 is very fun but they need to get GTA 6 out soon like please bro I need to spend all my money on GTA 6.

"Social Club sucks, can't download the Single Player separately, which makes it a super huge file to download, and most of the cool shit we could have had became DLC's for that cash-grab bs you call GTA Online"
fun game with lots of content
I love getting killed for a hour straight by someone three hundred levels higher than me in a armored car that can shoot rockets at me. : )
My amazing british friend butt fucked me for 4 hours straight W game
"its one of my favorite games but It gets boring if you don't have friends to play it with. it has great story mode, online is also fun.  keyboard and mouse controls are complicated for new players, i recommend using controller. 10/10 very fun"

the game is good but the modders are mean
got to do what walter does :)
it didnt work with my system an i tryed to get it to work for 6 hours an because it showed i was on it for 6 hours an i didnt even get to play that was just loading in an  changing setting never did i get to play an steam wouldnt even refund my money i would never buy from steam again any game bad service just a rip off stay far away
just fun
Really do recommend. Because the game is great i have had it for the 10 years that is has been out. LSPDFR and Menyoo mods are so great. Even without mods the game is still great. Without mods my favorite part in the game is probably the mission because their so fun to do.
Hmmmmmm. Good
its gta if you have to read reviews now just do your self a fovor and jusy bhuy it
it is fun but i cant play online
game is 10/10
best gta since san andreas
my mom walked in while i was getting a lap dance

gta is gta MAYHEM
allright

"A little clunky like most rockstar games, but is it fun... Yes"
"This game is an incredible game. You can choose to follow a story line which is incredible and fun to do, and will take you a while to complete. Or you can choose to play against other players and get money in the online version of the game. You can earn rp to level up and can get better gun the higher the level. It's incredibly open world as well. This game is amazing. It's worth the money 100%."
ROCKSTAR SOCIAL CLUB IS DOG SHIT
"better than league of legends. DEFINITELY go into the ""shoe store"" when your parents are watching, they will love it"

"All around good game, Never had any problems, I personally love it still love it"
Too many hackers and toxic players. I play online contents in invite only sessions.

nbbvnbvnvnvbnbvnbvnbv
i love this game bro but except for the mean hackers but the nice hackers are good
Waited 3.1 hours on a loading screen and ended up having to restore my entire PC
Well its a really nice game its not that short when i played it my first time my playtime was about 43 hours. The game is not dead like GTA SA i mean the city is bustling with life there are a lot of NPCs and there is a lot of their models. There is some few glitches and broken mechanics but the overall is great. The side quests are nice too when you dont have anything left to do. There are so many activities that you can do to diversify the game for me personally i like to play tennis its well made and realistic. You should buy this game if you didnt already.
it a good game
Why not
aint it
SO FUNNN COME PLAY WITH ME
What can I say but that this is peak gaming; a must have.
funny init
"I kinda like what I've seen so far, will keep playing to see if I really like it tho          pd: rockstar please do real servers for 6 and PC release day 1"
very good and alot of freedom
"nice, good storyline"
"I got this game at 7.12 dollar during autumn sale great game ,everyone should experience it  (My first review )"
BEST FUCKING GAME
love the gsme
Honestly such a good game. The performance is the only real issue for me but that is because of my computer. Would 100% recommend to anyone who wants a relatively slow moving story/online experience.
it was a fun game
This is my lifef
because
This game is so good.
GTA 6 VHWEN
GTA 6.
"Игра быстро надоедает если не проходить сюжетку, но довольно прикольная в самом гемплее много миссий и заданий и также есть онлайн советую для тех, кому нечего делать и хочется погонять на тачках, по убивать игроков и естественно повыпендриватся что ты всрал столько денег."

its has been class for the whole 12 or so years it has been out.Could play the story mode another 10 times.
Would recommend if you like to get blown up by 30 years old man flying broomstick that can shoot missiles.

VERY GOOD GAME  DOWNLOAD AND PLAY
"Gta is a very fun game to play and enjoy with ur friends, their is also many mods like LSPDFR you can play as a cop,swat,millitary,Fbi and many more. You cana also install FiveM and roleplay with other players in real time, you can be a gang member,millitary,fbi,swat, police,civ,you can also even havea  job, this game (fivem) is very fun because the cars,sounds are very realistic, this game evne has proximity chat, Which means when ur very far from a player you cannot hear them (like real life) but when your close to them u can hear them better the closer you get,  also Fivem is fun because you dont get a watned level by the cop npc's, you get a wanted level by the real pollice players!!! which means when you unalive a lot of cops you lose them, unlike gta v with the cops the more you kill them ore they come. an also you can roleplay robberys such as a bank,gas station."
best game everrrrrr gyattttt

"i purchase the game with the enterprise add on which give me several things free like garage and cars, when i entered the garage, it glitched me out under the garage and when i re login, im in the garage but unable to exit the garage, at all,.even the cars that supposed to be there isnt showing up, not to mention hackers keep killing me and other players (before i entered the garage)."
"I have waited years to play this game /,,/. Story is awesome.  Gameplay is awesome. Game is awesome."
I RECOMMENDED THIS GAME WHEN SOLO SESSION

"My friend who I play CS 2 with said if I post a review on D2, and it gets 75 likes and 30 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 3060 and 1 Kilo of Lemon . So im just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha"
I dunno about the story. Just went around shooting everything and everyone until I died to the cops.  And then repeated the process once I got out the hospital.
balss heh
I Love This Game >:)
Been playing since back in 2014/2015 on the Xbox 360 and it's been such a great game ever since. Glad to be apart of this community and I am looking forward to GTA VI (6)!!
"I have it on both consoles and now pc too, still fun to play as always."
Cheetah makes me so hard
play with friends
R.I.P to all the families of those cops who I slaughtered because I was bored :) Fun game overall.
great game except for the griefers
"Dear Rockstar, thank you for an amazing ten years of this game. I just got a PC this year, but I know Ill still be visiting this game here & on PS4 even after 6 drops. Truly a whole world to explore."
GOOD ENOUGH TO GET FUCKED BY MODDERS
Awesome open world game.

only played for about 2 days now (says 33 hours played cuz i fell asleep while i just so happened to have gta running) and its already top 2 greatest games i've ever played and I can clearly tell it's going to be top 1 in the future. Truly amazing game.

BEST GAME EVER I MEAN IT
"GTA V to jest w porządku gra polecam wszystkim którzy nie grali , ja już grałem na Xboxie ale od 3 dni gram i lepiej się gra na pc . Pozdrawiam"
Heck ye.
mmm
"First time ever trying a GTA game.  Bought this on sale, cheap. Maybe it's too old, maybe i'm too old, but a few minutes in, I knew this wasn't for me.   Uninstalled, got a very quick refund.  My thanks to Steam and Valve."
"someone spawned in a whole bunch of money for me, now i'm permabanned and can't do anything about it. Rockstar won't undo my ban either"
Online mod is filled with hackers/modders that ruin gameplay. Good luck reporting them as many have a mod that crashes your game should you click on 'report'.  Campaign and private matches with friends is fun.
r4eally fun with friends
niec gaem me liek boobies!!!!!!
the game of all time
Endless loading screens and more cheaters than money in Rockstars back account.
"I have no idea how this game is as popular as it is. The game is essentially a terrible menu simulator, the people that play it are all either cheating or toxic, and there is little to no explanation as to what you should actually be doing. If you do not have friends to play this game with, do not get it as you will likely have a less-than-ideal experience."
i enjoy it
I LIKE
Leaving a good review to encourage rockstar to make GTA 6 quicker.
kaboom
very good and fun.
absolute tits
ofc an excellent game
this just gotta be the best game out there

devious nevos movas?
Large game sessions around when I just used to play on PS3 then back in here I'd like to say this game has changed a lot. Not only the lobby's ain't the same but there's many more variation of activities you can play on.
GTA6 is gonna be lit
THIS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL GAME WAS ALL OF MY CHILDHOOD. AlSO HOW IN THE AVACADO FUCK IS GTA 6 REALEASING IN FUCKING 2025 THAT IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS
ITS SOOOOOOOOOOO COOLL
This game is amazing dude!!! I played it since last 3 years but mow also I am enjoying this game. I would recommend you to buy this game.
"We'll probably be 30 till gta 6 is out so just get it, my best memories came from this game when i was younger. Just get it and remember it takes money to make money, grind and youll have fun"

Había uno que se burlaba en el sv. Fuimos a buscarlo de a 3 en un tanque blindado rosa y lo bajamos 3 veces.  Buen juego.
I just buy a GTA V and its not working ! whose the seller?
"To many issues when having mods installed with this game and also before installing the mods I got many errors from the game, Tried to ask for a refund and they denied me."
Masterpiece
brilliant game and amazing story
"so good, amazing"

"I'll have 2 number nines, a number nine large. A number six with extra dip. A number seven. Two number forty-fives, one with cheese, and a large soda."
cok guzel ama amk polisleri osursam bile geliyor
"This game in incredible! You can so much things! Theres to many stuff and it actually looks real. I would recommend this game to people that like high graphic games, shooting games or rp games."
Solo-public lobbies for the win =)
"Game is very fun, works well on most pcs.  Online public lobbies are a nightmare, so i would recommend playing online with friends only or in a private session."
Always a fantastic time picking this back up!
100
Two words!!
i love it it is the best game ever
"Junk on PC, Cant use GTA online save from PS4"
BEST GAME BEFORE GTA 6 i can't wait.

"very cool, very nice"
Hackers make this game unplayable on pc
"Great game, I love it!"
yes!
WASTE OF MONEY!
it was awsome bedsides the point of how much hackers there are
have over 100 hours on gta v and gta iv highly recommend this game.story is  amazing mutiplayer is fantastic with friends or without.the games a masterpiece like every gta game
game is a ton of fun even ten years after it's initial release
"I never played the online stuff, don't care for it, and I think the absurd money it makes has really hurt not just Rockstar (in terms of actual game development instead of just making shark cash bait) but the industry as a whole.  However... I can't deny that the single-player experience of the game is excellent. Very memorable and enjoyable. Not a lot of bad things to say, in fact; I usually end up replaying it every few years. I say just go for it."
כמגעםןוגכרידן8וטערגדניזן
has no words
mmmm
gta v became a trash game cuz of moders and hackers they f*kin teleport next to me this is nuts dont buy or play trash game
bro its gta 5 how do you not like it
Triver michael homie
Classic!
Grand rp
very gud game
the game itself isn't fun unless you have friends to play with but it gives you a lot to do and you can grind this game for days on end.
"Ah ni**a don't hate me cause I'm beautiful ni**a. Maybe if you got rid of that old yee yee ass haircut, you'd get some b*tches on yo d*ck. Oh, better yet, maybe Tanisha'll call your dog ass if she stops f*ckin’' with that brain surgeon or lawyer she f*ckin with. Nii**gaaaa"
"10 years later, it's still a great game."
in the first few minutes i was attacked by an albino monkey with the thirst for blood and it began fighting me but then a few minutes later i befriended it becoming best friends with it for the entire time i was in that session and all of it happened in just online it was really great and loved every second of it.
good games =))
childhood dream to buy this with my own money

gta 12 is better i got early access
"It is an old timer now, after all the years but still beats latest AAA releases by a mile! Easily my fav game of the decade"
always a fu time
is my fav game in my life
"Very good story, many hours of fun in Story mode. The Online mode is a work of art, fun, entertaining, many things to do, the only bad thing is that it is plagued by hackers who can access your computer remotely and steal your data."
this is good game. i saw a shoe emoji and haven't gone there yet. I am going to when I get back home. I'm excited to get the new jordan 1's. :)
opp
fun when you unlock everything and rampage through the city

Alot of Bugs and The server are SHI T
heaven
this game is so fun to play with ur friends
"Rockstar is nothing but an ignorant company in the topics of their player base and how cheaters are almost in every single damn server of GTA Online. Every day and even every minute they ruin people's fun time and gameplay which makes GTA Online itself unbearable but ofcourse Rockstar games isn't so willing to put up an anti-cheat programme just because for whatever reason as if they claim that GTA Online and their player base is not-so-important and just like they let go of Red Dead Online, they are slowly letting go of GTA Online because their incompetence and hunger for money is higher than the values they give towards the game. So if you are here for online, get ready for a hot and ready disappointment at your monitor being delivered to you personally. Because Rockstar Games letting people ruin their game. They don't even give a shit about reports, i have personally reported many cheaters, sometimes even same guy over and over again for coming up to me later on and ruin my game or crash it."
It's a very fun game  this is my second time trying to play the first time my purchase didn't show up in game but this time every thing worked out and it has been a great experience
skibidi toilet game
many naked girls
good cops and ez money
badass game
"Bought this after owning it on console and getting a PC. PC version is a poor port of the console version. No Ray Tracing at all, which the consoles have. Also GTA VI was announced for console but not PC. I recommend not giving rockstar money until they start treating PC users fairly."
me like it
uih9
good play gta 5
"this game is good but the only problem is that u cant play gta online in public server because of hackers and rockstar is doing nothing for it,"
funny strip club fart
good good god god  gd gd g g

GTa five (5) is a game where
thios game is so good
Best story line and best map! They could update the story line more its too short you only need like 15hours of play time to finish whole story (not 100%) but beating game to 100% is just too hard because you have to find all these randomly place items that you cant find without google..
best multiplayer game
HI hi
bag pula in el de joc. Foarte bun joc
It's fun but there are a lot of sexual shows So it's not good for children

"GTA V Story Mode: 5/5 Stars  - Story is epic; each character has a lot of in-depth individual stories, about who are they? | Gameplay, from gunplay to driving a vehicle, is enjoyable | Map size is okay | Game graphics, beautiful from 2013 until this day.  - But they should make your bought car not disappear when you leave it. Instead, it just returns to your garage.  GTA Online: 3/5 Stars  - uhhhh.. Grindy... and a mess  - When I joined the public session mostly, I was bombarded with people in chat advertising their mod menu, or sometimes moderators jailing your character so it could not move, ruining lobby sessions and business missions. There were some friendly moderators that helped me with business missions. (Invite only session is better.)  - So back in the summer update, when they gave GTA 5 free on Epic I grind ""business mission"" just selling cars and leveling up and character stats to profit. ;)  ;)   - Mainly playing online just to have fun with friends playing Heist. Or doing an online race,stunt race, and the new one a drift race..."
fun to grind

"They say ""happy holidays"" instead of ""Merry Christmas"""

"[b]You probably should[/b] play this. It's story isn't horrible and it has a few amazing moments within it, but wowee stay away from online and most things that aren't a create-your-own fun scenario."
"fun game, racist players  10/10"
"Yes.....that is all. Oh and GTA 6 in 2025 so, yah playing it again to scratch the itch."

Its so good one of the best games ever made buy it you wont regret it. I promise!
boobs in my face..... where is my gta 6 rockstar........(╯°□°)--︻╦╤─ - - -(╯°□°)--︻╦╤─ - - -
Rockstar could give a literal 2 SH*TS about regulating the cheaters in this game.
its really a great game there can ever be out there its great...love it
i cant even play this game no more because of the rockstar linked account issue.
"just buy the game, you will never, as in never, regret it, playing this game is like a dream come true"
very good game to binge chill

AMAZING GAME AND MISSIONS
"[b]A great campaign with a cartoonishly-comedic story that doesn't try to be touching and realistic like in GTA IV, but that doesn't make it terrible. Great sandbox, beautiful open world - hopefully the sixth part will please us no less.  [i]The only significant minus of the game is GTA Online, which just sucks![/i][/b]"
campaign slaps
The best game in 2010s. Released in 2013 (console) but now in 2023 a lot of people still playing this. Can't wait for GTA 6 !
obviously yes. one of the greatest games of all time
super and i like this game
LOVE IT!!!
so fun and have extra more category game
its gta 5 so that makes it a good game
Been playing this Game ever since Xbox  360 Came out.

"best game ever made, better than bestselling game minecraft"
this is the best rp game onna market
ITS CRAZY FUN AND THERE IS SWEARING AND GOOD OLD HEISTS :D  I RECOMMEND IT!
Very good game. Free shoe store could have a wider variety but still a good game
Best game ever! *needs no introduction*
"Very low expectations for GTA 6 after spending less than a month with this lightly-polished turd.   Offline/Story mode is way too short, and there's not enough story for each character. They all just feel like side-characters with a little extra screen time. What little of them is added to Online doesn't make up for this at all, nor does all the extra side crap in story mode.   Online is the real dumpster fire. A lazy, even more buggy, stupid excuse for a cash grab built around a bunch of badly-implemented good and bad ideas and designed to spread and induce toxicity and punish people for trying to get away from that crap. Rockstar are abusing every mental manipulation they can to try to keep people playing, but anyone who does so must just be desperate for something to do because it is boring AF playing the same crap for disproportionate effort vs payout in so many different forms, getting grief'ed constantly in public lobbies no matter how peaceful you are, and etc.   Between this and the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition BS, Rockstar has officially justified pirating their games, but in reality everyone is better off just avoiding this bloated, corporation-focused shadow of what was once a good game studio entirely. Long live III, VC, SA, IV; because V killed GTA."
good game with much gratuitous violence
hill kookers
AMEI O PUTEIRO
its fun game and the world is great to mess around in and even better with the online bits. The story was decent but the ending kinda just okay.
"Hacking makes online unplayable. If you run into a hacker all you can do is leave that online session and go to another hacked session, This is the first time I have ever requested a refund from steam. Do not buy this if you want to play online. :("
this is my dream game.....
awesome game man :)
nnbjnk
"very good, dont play online tho"
Game is pretty much useless now that I can't even log into it without Rockstar informing me that my Steam Account is connected to another unknown Rockstar Account.
this game is my love

"The original content is great and worth the while to sit down and play for some 150 ish hours, but after that the new updates are sloppy in writing, they lack any fun and interesting characters. plot lines, visuals and are generally bankrupt, missions are drug out until they run you insane out of boredom, jokes that don't land because they could never even fly, i'd suggest you buy this game off a website that sells the keys for cheaper since the original value of 60 euro is just not there anymore."

"What ruins 137 hours of game time?  Having completed all the missions, strangers and freaks, hobbies and pastimes, random events, and miscellaneous missions, I realized that Simeon Yetarian is one mission that must be completed between 'Friend Request' and 'The Jewel Store Job'.   Yes I'm broke."

Made a child cry worth every penny
I'm so thankful the DMV doesn't check my driving history in this game

"After completing Grand Theft Auto V on 2 console generations, I got to say that the PC version is far more superior and the performance is way better than the PS4 or PS3 and Xbox 360.  I recommend purchasing it on PC. Mods make the story mode way better. Get this game."
don't trust people that say they've never played through the main story
This some bullshit
Good game but too much modders one stole my car i spent over 5 million on it and rockstar doesnt care.
I LIKED IT BECAOUSE MY BROTHER LIKES IT
bes game
"The game is unbearable nowadays, every sessions is full of cheaters that will grief your will to play the game to the ground."
Best open word game
ok.
can gamble all my money and lose it all. also cheap strip club.
I have still yet to get my code for the whale shark bundle
I'm only writing this so steam stops asking me to write a review.
wicked fun looks amazing
I made a kid break his PC because if he didn't i was going shoot his car
it lags way too much and is really slow so pls fix
good game to mess with people
its epic
"One of the most annoying worst online experiences even if you are part of the problem. Basically Rockstar is never going to stop their hacker problem and they actually treated them to a special Christmas event. And people can still do whatever they feel. Playing this game online is like being a criminal basically. Don't be a criminal kids. There needs to be legal laws to ban rockstar from having and advertising these servers. They are broken and unplayable. Long loading times, nobody who is a legit gamer plays this game online. Everyone is no joke just made because my K/D is 11,000 players in 4,000 D basically now the tables changed. People can't admit they get mad when someone gets them over their skill. Now they use hacks because the last person did. So do not buy this game for online, You will waste your time, and rockstar will not do anything about it. Been giving support tickets, GTA V ONLINE SERVERS SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN, NOW!"
Great game seeing how its over a decade old! Love the grind for the money you're going to spend as soon as you get it. Can't wait for VI and I'll probably keep playing this masterpiece until it comes out.
Still awesome after 10 years
Greatest of the greatest!
BORING
God Gift!
it crashes and lags
Murica 🔫 🐔
modders and bugs shit game
Very recommended for fun to play story mode
"Even though the game has been out for quite some time, it is hard to swallow a storyline as violent as it knowing the profits Rockstar make, all while imprisoning a 18 year old for life for leaking a bunch of files online. That cost them not even 1% of their revenue  I can never enjoy one of their games ever again."
"THE BEST I HAVE EVER PLAYED . THIS IS JUST LEGIT MAN ITS 2023 AND ITS STILL THE BEST I HAVE EVER PLAYED  , NO GAME WILL EVER BE BETTER THAN THIS COZ THIS IS SOO GOOD"
ass.
Very fun. Me kill hooker
grand theft auto five
eehh
MAn this game is awsme
"-={ 9 / 10 }=- Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece of open-world design, storytelling, and sandbox freedom. Its immersive world, complex characters, and darkly humorous narrative provide an unparalleled playground for virtual crime sprees. While its mature themes and occasional mission hiccups might deter some, for those willing to dive into the gritty underbelly of Los Santos, GTA V is an unforgettable experience that leaves a lasting mark long after the final credits roll. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility... and a healthy dose of explosives for when things inevitably get chaotic.  -={ GAMEPLAY }=- Living, breathing sandbox: Los Santos and Blaine County overflow with vibrant detail, from bustling city streets to sun-baked deserts, offering endless opportunities for exploration and mayhem. Three unforgettable protagonists: Michael, Franklin, and Trevor are more than just playable characters; they're flawed, complex individuals with motivations that twist and turn as the story unfolds. Cinematic storytelling: From pulse-pounding action sequences to darkly comedic exchanges, GTA V delivers a rollercoaster ride of a narrative that rivals Hollywood blockbusters. Unparalleled online playground: GTA Online extends the experience with a constantly evolving world of cooperative heists, competitive showdowns, and player-created chaos.  Mature, often offensive content: Violence, nudity, and strong language are abundant, making GTA V unsuitable for younger audiences. Mission design can be uneven: Some missions feel repetitive or frustrating, occasionally breaking the narrative flow. Microtransactions in GTA Online: While not pay-to-win, some may find the optional in-game purchases for faster progression intrusive.  -={ PRICE }=-"
THE BEST GAME FOR RP / MODS / stor
sweeeeeeet
It was my dream game
"It's Grand Theft Auto 5, if it at this point you need explaining what that means then you even reading this review is pointless.  Online is super grindy and meh. Single Player remains a good fun story with excellent characters and story beats."
Everything's perfect. Just waiting for GTA 6!
Best game for cars and driving
i love wade
"GTA online is pretty much unplayable on the pc unless you do private servers. there is at least 1 or 2 modders (hackers/cheaters) in every single lobby. Some will give you free money but most will turn on god mode, turn invisible, and then automatically taze everyone on the server 10 times/second so you cant move. or theyll telport everyone on the server to them to kill them.   Even when the games not being ruined by cheaters its ruined by rockstars own bugs. trying to quick join a heist will put you on a never ending loading screen more than half the time. I had the most expensive vehicle disappear from my inventory/garage. Gameis such a piece of garbage."

I started an online character and within 30 mins of being on was given a bunch of money and exp ended up at rank 138 and with half a million without having to do anything because of some mystery body suit Santa player 10/10 game
The story to the game is very good however the game is now 10 years old and updates for the online mode is becoming worse overtime.
It is fun
This game is really fun
Very good but cayo not good enymore
"Plus: The open world, alot of freedom. Cars and other vehicles. Minus: Alot of griefers. If that wasn't enough, you have quite alot of hackers and exploits that can circumvent you being in passive mode and kill you no matter what. Pity"

"So, when beans taste like a donkey small intestine, that's when you know you should start building a house of baking powder."
"!IF YOU ARE HAVING THE ""Unable to download required Files From Rockstar Services"" ERROR PLEASE READ LAST PARAGRAPH!  Played this game with a Friend with no issues for months then put it down and when i came back to it the other day i couldn't Play Online I kept getting the ""Unable to download required Files From Rockstar Services"" error, I Issued a ticket with R* and got a Bot Response TWICE in a row then after waiting a day or two and trying every fix i could think of R* closed my ticket and didn't Issue any Response, I DID end up fixing the error, The simple fix stated below is the reason i am negatively reviewing R* as opposed to this game (although i do dislike the grievers this game promotes online which ruin it for everyone), as they have made a game which requires these infuriating steps and offered a poor Customer Service Experience, I have such taken to referring to R* Lovingly as F@#k-star for the Foreseeable Future  The Fix was as simple as going to OUTBOUND RULES in windows Firewall permissions and allowing GTAV."
its alright but gta 6 soon
alot of moders
Amazing game can't wait to see what gta6 will be like
only rps is good
Get this for GTA VI
"I purchased the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack, installed it, and launched the game without receiving any of the stuff. I tried restarting the game, but it would not work either. It also did not provide me with instructions on how to obtain the products. Rather than instructing me on how to obtain the products. I just logged in and have nothing."

"this is a review for online. this game is only worth it on discount, i wouldn't pay more than $18 bucks for it because it's really, really buggy :/ so many missions we had to restart. too many to count. also the acid lab missions are CRINGE... tell me you've never done drugs without telling me you've never done drugs."

"the worst game you can think of is this, because 99% of this game is full of kids playing on modded accounts ruining the fun of everyone by giving theire selfs godmod and grieffing anyone else+ anticheat doesnt work on this peace of trash, and i have nothing to expect on gta6 , it will be just like gta5 , with a lot of kids playing it"

"Amazing game, I genuinely recommend it. The graphics are incredible and the story line and the characters are so well written. Story mode can start off a little bit slow but then you become so immersed in the lives and relationships of the characters. Really fun and definitely one of my favourite games ever."
Its very entertaining. v v v enjoyed

"Grand Theft Auto V stands as a towering achievement in the world of gaming, offering an open-world experience that's as exhilarating as it is expansive. Set in the sprawling, fictional city of Los Santos, this game seamlessly blends action, narrative depth, and boundless exploration.  From the moment you step foot into this virtual metropolis, the attention to detail is staggering. The city feels alive, teeming with a diverse population, bustling streets, and a vibrant ecosystem that reacts to your every move. The level of immersion is unmatched as you navigate a world that feels as dynamic and unpredictable as our own.  But beyond its stunning visuals and vast open world, it's the intertwining stories of three distinct protagonists that elevate this game to greatness. Michael, Franklin, and Trevor each bring their own flavor to the narrative, offering a multifaceted perspective on the criminal underworld and their intertwining lives. Their stories intertwine seamlessly, providing a rich and engaging storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The freedom this game affords is unparalleled. Whether you're causing mayhem in the city streets, engaging in high-speed pursuits, or simply soaking in the details of a sun-soaked skyline, there's always something to do. The breadth of activities, from adrenaline-fueled heists to leisurely rounds of golf, ensures that boredom is never an option.  Furthermore, GTA Online extends the experience far beyond the single-player campaign, allowing you to dive into a persistent multiplayer world. Collaborate with friends in heists, compete in races, or simply revel in the chaos of the open-world sandbox with countless other players.  In summary, Grand Theft Auto V isn't just a game; it's a living, breathing universe of its own. Its blend of immersive storytelling, boundless exploration, and unparalleled freedom cements its place as a titan in the gaming industry, offering an experience that continues to captivate and enthrall players worldwide."

"I love this game, its great and the distro that comes along with it... AMAZING."
why no crossplay
fortnite
llllll
i love this game💖
i like hijacking cars and running over innocent pedestrians its great would recommend
It's a very good game and now i know why this game has a great story and still playable after 10 years. Though there are some issues with gta online as you know there are many hackers in the lobby. If Rockstar could just ban these hackers gta online experience would be great. Overall this game is worth playing and paying.
"was actually able to play the game for a while before getting off for like 6 months, when i try to log back in the initializing bar is in the bottom right and im just sitting waiting for hours, dont get this game because if you log off for more than 6 months GTA 5 the game itself just breaks and  you cant play it and all i wanted to do was play story mode so i could get my moneys worth of the game now im just considering on refunding the game but i still want to play GTA 5 on pc if anyone knows whats happening pls comment i guess"

"Broken, outdated and addictive.  Publisher and Devs are just trying to squeeze as much money they can out of you."
this shit bussin
"Grand Theft Auto Online, the multiplayer counterpart to the iconic GTA series, has unfortunately become a prime example of a game suffering due to profit-driven decisions by its publisher, Take-Two Interactive. The experience in GTA Online feels less like a player-focused venture and more like a relentless pursuit of monetization at the expense of player enjoyment.  One of the glaring issues is the inordinate focus on microtransactions. Take-Two seems more interested in squeezing every last dollar out of players than delivering a balanced and enjoyable gaming experience. The exorbitant prices for in-game items, coupled with the grind-heavy nature of the game, make it clear that the primary concern is the virtual wallet rather than player satisfaction.  Updates and new content often prioritize expensive in-game purchases rather than addressing core issues and improving the overall gameplay experience. It feels like Take-Two is pushing players toward spending real money to stay relevant in the game, creating a sense of frustration and exclusion for those who may not be willing or able to invest additional funds.  The rampant presence of hackers and modders further compounds the problem, creating an environment where legitimate players are left to fend for themselves against unfair advantages. Instead of addressing these concerns, Take-Two's focus appears to be on releasing new, money-making content, neglecting the need for a fair and secure gaming environment.  In conclusion, the current state of GTA Online reflects a disheartening prioritization of profit over player satisfaction by Take-Two Interactive. The game has devolved into a grind-heavy, microtransaction-laden experience that often leaves players feeling frustrated and alienated. It's a stark reminder that a game's success should be measured by more than just its financial gains."
Really Good game!
"Very fun game. Online is great with friends, but not as fun solo"

really fun to play with friends but if your on gta online not in a private lobby you would just want to kill your self cuz of the other players
Just amazing !! what more can i say
The game is good but Rockstar gave me an already used code!!!  So I have to wait to reactivate it.
playing online feels like I am getting kicked in the balls over and over again

GOOD EXPERIENCE
one of the best game I am olaying this game on mac by Crossover it runes smooth
I love it
I have time enough to declare my taxes while GTA: Online is loading.
"In the city of Los Santos, a young hustler falls under the wing of a former criminal living a difficult retirement. Circumstances lead to the pair to have to do a job to pay off a debt – a job which gets national coverage and draws unwanted attention from a former partner, corrupt cops, ruthless movie moguls, rival gangs, aggressive fitness fanatics and many others.  I have played this game series on and off over the years but (criminally) did not play the former one based in Los Santos but instead rejoined with GTA4, a game I enjoyed but not one without its flaws. The good news with V is that the game keeps the strengths of the fourth game but makes many improvements which produce a much more fun and enjoyable experience across many aspects. The first thing to say is that the world of LS is technically amazing in terms of its attention to detail and beauty – it is hard to describe to people who decide they do not like these games, but to see a glorious sunset from a hillside, with perfect shadow effects and vegetation movement and know that someone designed and made this, not just filmed it, is something that hit me over and over throughout the game. The map is enjoyably large with diverse landscapes and character and I still find great pleasure in just going around in it even if I have nothing specific to do.  The story is solid enough for the game even if it is rather generic and overblown. The characters are quite clichéd in some regards. Michael's story for instance is not so imaginative and generally I found him the least of the characters. Franklin is similar but covered by him being the ""intro"" character, so I stayed close to him throughout. Trevor is a wonderfully violent and funny character and his entrance is memorable and really shakes the game up. The events of the story are necessarily overblown but this is part of the fun and generally I liked the flow to it. The many supporting characters are great fun and the energy and color of it all does cover up for the fact that the story is not really that complex or engaging at times. As it is though, it is about events and set-pieces and the game provides plenty of fun memorable missions (admittedly as well as a handful of awful ones), and in this way there are loads of missions to replay and enjoy and, most importantly, this game actually allows you to load them to do just that.  Side missions add color and fun and, although I do miss ongoing missions like the vigilante ones from IV, there is still plenty to do. The range of vehicles adds to this and I also enjoyed how much easier they are to drive than in the previous game. Weapon customization and the range of them provide fun destruction, although the police are a lot more aggressive in this game than in IV, so it is harder to go on a rampage and make it last. In theory the Online world offers endless gaming – I tried it for one evening and it was fun despite all the issues, but the community seemed messed up and very reliant on having an existing group of players – it looks fun but I'm just more of an offline player these days.  Grand Theft Auto V is a great game, even if you ""only"" play the days and days of content in the single player game. Technically the game is astounding with its attention to detail and just the sheer beauty of the audio and visual design of the whole world. The plot is solid enough to do the job while the characters (main and supporting) are colorful enough to engage while playing through missions which are mostly enjoyable and offer plenty of big set-pieces that are overblown and fun."
You know a game is sh1t when you cant even login. Been talking to support for 5 days and they still cant help me.
"Rockstar keep updating useless content, nothing new. 1000 hours on for a few months."

"Absolutely addicted to this game. I keep comin back to collect n mod more cars. I love all the things you can do in the game n being able to mess around with the community (Though most online players have hacks and tend to ruin it). If there's too much goin on, private lobbies always help. Great game, can't wait for VI."

Good old GTA

"The online is an absolute joke, Riddled with modding trolls who crash your game, lock you in cages, run around with god mode teleporting you around. For every maybe 50 modders you'll find one that isn't nefarious. Every single online lobby has modding trolls in it and if you're lucky to find one without them, it will only be a matter of time before one joins. Rockstars solution? Invite only sessions which turn online mode into just a buggy extension of the story mode.  On top of that the latest chop shop update is riddled with soft locking bugs that require you to restart the game and start missions over again just to be able to complete them. For one of the most profitable games in gaming history you would think they would hire some professional game developers but apparently there's not many competent coders in the gaming industry anymore. I could write code at 13 years old more stable than this embarrassment.   Tldr: If you want to play online just find an RP server to play in, those server owners care about their private servers more than Rockstar does their own game."

I bought the game recently and I can’t play it. It kept asking for activation code every time when I open the game then when put it a message shows up telling me the activation code already in use !  I made a report ticket to contact the support with every information needed 4 days ago but no response till now
You can spend some hours on this game
100% would recommend this game. GTA is such a great franchise and 5 is one of the best apart from san andreas. It is realistic fun and i have got over 1 year of playtime out of this and still find my self coming back for  more. I love riding around the steets of los santos and san andreas based off of california and los angeles Best stuff ever

"""Grand Theft Auto V: A Timeless Triumph in Gaming Excellence""  Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  Grand Theft Auto V stands as a towering achievement in the world of gaming, a testament to Rockstar Games' unrivaled ability to craft a virtual experience that transcends entertainment. Even years after its initial release, GTA V remains an absolute masterpiece, continually drawing players into the vibrant and chaotic world of Los Santos.  From the moment you step into the meticulously crafted city, the level of detail is staggering. Los Santos is a living, breathing entity, pulsating with energy and realism. The game's visuals are a feast for the eyes, showcasing Rockstar's commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in an open-world setting. The attention to detail, from the bustling city streets to the serene countryside, is nothing short of awe-inspiring.  But what truly elevates GTA V to legendary status is its narrative brilliance. The intertwining stories of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor create a narrative tapestry that is as compelling as any Hollywood blockbuster. The characters are richly developed, each with their own motivations and quirks, making them more than just protagonists – they're complex, flawed individuals you can't help but invest in.  The heist missions, a hallmark of the GTA series, are the epitome of gaming excellence. The level of strategic planning, coupled with the freedom to execute plans in various ways, provides a sense of agency rarely seen in other games. Whether you're orchestrating a daring bank heist or engaging in high-speed pursuits, the gameplay is a perfect blend of challenge and sheer fun.  GTA V's soundtrack is a work of art in itself. The radio stations boast an eclectic mix of music, catering to diverse tastes, and the original score seamlessly complements the on-screen action. The attention to audio detail, from the roar of engines to the ambient sounds of the city, further immerses players in the game's world.  The longevity of GTA V is also owed to its dynamic online multiplayer mode, GTA Online. This ever-expanding world offers limitless opportunities for cooperative and competitive play, ensuring that the Grand Theft Auto experience extends far beyond the confines of the single-player campaign.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V isn't just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon that has left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape. Rockstar Games has crafted an experience that transcends its medium, delivering a perfect blend of narrative depth, visual splendor, and engaging gameplay. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the series, GTA V is an absolute must-play – a timeless triumph that continues to redefine the possibilities of interactive entertainment."

gggggggggggggggggggggggg
arson
muito bom recomendo esse jogo é praticamente uma obra
I cant join with my friend.
grand theft auto v.... the reason that my review took so long is because i always 100% my games before writing a review for them so here it is i guess the story of grand theft auto v has aged very well after all these years and its nice to visit it after a while but unfortunately not everything else so if someone installs the game and only plays through the main story and a few side missions its a very solid experience but the collectibles and the side missions have such a dated and a not fun design to them that really drag this game down like the fact that the game doesn't tell you which stunt jumps are remaining or where is the alien piece and etc. and don't get me started on gta online i swear to god i never had a worst online experience in all of my years as a gamer and the fact that a lot of the achievements are from gta online just made the whole process so much more tedious  i never want to touch gta online ever again  i think the story is solid enough to justify buying this game but if you love your sanity dont go for completion or online achievements
GTA IV is better.

"The story is a contrived mess, the game play in storymode is extremely linear to the point of being tedious. The online is an ultra monetized nightmare"
"Amazing story, characters and gunplay. Just know you are about to have to grind Online for 5 billions years to afford anything worthwhile."
nice game nice site
"I have enjoyed playing every GTA game I have come across. The story mode is incredibly engaging, and the online version can be equally enjoyable if you find a private lobby away from the modders and hackers. However, due to the constant interference of modders, it has become increasingly difficult to complete missions and enjoy the game. For this reason, I cannot recommend it to others looking for a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience."
LESTER STOP CALLING ME!
no need to explain.
LOL the game has released for 10 years and it still has many bug
This isn't just about violence. It has depth in its story that you can only expect from rockstar. It is based on America as everyone know.
hhdfggffhh
"What a bad game!!! The dialogues are so incredible stupid and the handling feels so off all the time! When it comes to the missions, there is only ONE correct way to do them, no freedom whatsoever! But what bothers me the most is really the stupid characters and their unbearable dialogues! ""I don't care if you are twelve, I'm going to rape you anyway"" was the sentence that made me quite this game at last! Just what our society needs: Even More anti-heroes who idealize drugs, abuse and the all consuming pursued of making money!"
crazy
i love cheat engine
all good but it does freeze every now and then
-ran over 10k pedestrians -robbed a bank -killed the most influent person in the entire lore of this -cops still don't recognise me  10/10

"Ive played GTA ever since it was a thing. My favorites were San Andreas and Vice City. I bought this game about 10 years ago and never really played it through until my roommate started playing it through the Online version. I had no idea what I was missing out on! This game is utterly fantastic! Rockstar really went all out when they developed this masterpiece. You can do whatever you like in this game, consequences included of course! But that's where the charm comes from. Jump in, have fun, run missions, become an underworld crime lord and get away with it! It's a nice step away from reality for a few hours at a time!"
Ten years old memories relived again in 4K What’s here not to like.

"great solo, bad public"
Can't wait for GTA VI
"GTA Online takes 4EVER to load. I can select ""Join Heist"" and then go start dinner and come back to wait 10 more minutes for a game to load."

Played this game on Xbox then switched to PC and the graphics are way better along with the game play.
solid game not to bad but not the best either
"CHEATERS IN EVERY CORNER, DO NOT BUY IF YOU INTEND ON PLAYING THE ONLINE EDITION OF THIS GAME. 10 years old, and still having these issues?"
I really love the realism of the game and the physics
the best free world playground
good game that all i got to say
certified banger
yayayya
"An older game right now, but still great. Never liked playing it online. Always preferred the story mode."
"NGL THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING FUN, LOVE ROCKSTARSSS"
Newest update removed ~180 cars from the game. Half of the update is unavailable on PC. Newest missions are near impossible for solo play. Easily the worst update to GTA online ever. Takes away more content than it adds.
good game very good game   papa like
I ran ovber guy and than he go sploosp
Great game. I personally prefer it on the computer the controls seem to be more responsive than on the xbox
good stuff duh
i do like tish game :) love litty kids
"Don't buy Rockstar games. They require that you make an account with them to play even single-player. Then they allow hackers to steal your account and change your email and password WITHOUT contacting you or sending a warning email, nothing. Can't play singleplayer."
verry gud

Return on investment is much better, I promise you guys, and I’m not saying this because she cheated on me, no no..."

super great game for all the family!
Amazing game with mods love the cars!! (:
That was the most fu**ing wild ride of a game i've experienced.. so violent.. so tough.. just looking like a vitual reality for me to express my own dark version without affecting my own reality..
"My 18 year old ask me to reinstall the game and in doing so I noticed that I had yet to review the game.  We have at the time of this review over 320 hours play time on the PC, with nearly double that on the PS4.   Funny thing is that we have never even completed the story campaign or played on the online portion.   The vast majority of the time was just my daughter and I making tons and tons of mayhem.   Well more me making the mayhem and her going on joy rides.  For years now she has asked me when GTVA 6 was coming out and she was so glad to hear that it was finally coming out in a couple more years.  I don't care what people say I am glad for her that she will finally have a female anti-hero to play as.  In the past we have always modded the game just so she could play as a female character.   I tire of people saying a game is ""woke"" just because it has a female lead.  Grow up and get with the current century is what I have to say and I am in my fifties so it isn't like I am a Millennial or Gen Z saying this.   If you don't like the character being female, do the opposite of what we did and mod the character to a male.  Anyway, it is amazing how much fun this game is just driving around and sightseeing even after all these years the game still holds up as a decent looking game.  Rockstar put heart and soul into the game and it shows.  By the way if you ever get a chance to meet Steven Ogg (voice of Trevor) in real life, do it.  The dude is hundred kinds of funny and a cool dude all around."
sdef
this is the best game
Still amazing 10 years on

kool game yeah!
Bought it at least three times. What more can I say
IMPOSTER
best open world game of all time.
"I had to request a refund because I couldn't even get to the game.   Trying to launch the game starts a launcher where you have to create an account and give personal information. That alone is very annoying, but I went through the process and thought that was that but I was sorely mistaken. After setting up an account and verifying my email, the launcher asked for an activation code and it provided no information on where to get it. I looked up online and apparently you can see this code if you log in with the created account on the rockstar website. I tried logging in and I was met with the worst captcha I have ever seen.  The captcha is very difficult, you need to match randomly generated rooms with several objects to a black-and-white map of the correct room layout. That is already challenging by itself, but the kicker is you have to do it 10 times. So I did my best and submitted their captcha 10 times. At the end it gave me the message ""That was not quite right"" and I had to start over.  I tried a couple more times but in the end I gave up and asked for a refund.  I don't understand why game publishers put these hoops to play their games, I already paid you so just let me access your game ffs."
SO FUN
this game is insane i had so much fun playing it pls download it
"only OG kings remember evan, nogla, tyler, brian, marcel, delirious, ohm and lui."

TO MANY FUCKING HACKS
verryyyyy goood thisss gameee i likeee itt
i like everything about this game
"At a discount, I totally recommend this game. It can be a fun bit. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the mark for me, it becomes too repetitive. I feel like I spent most of my time in the game driving around the city.   The characters lack depth, appearing rather one-dimensional. Although they're intended as satirical figures, I found the critique of society lacking due to a lack of insightful storytelling. The excessive violence and torture felt out of place, lacking context and purpose, devoid of any impactful consequences. Some side missions were entertaining, yet others felt mundane and offered little reward, contributing to an overall weak storyline. Despite moments of entertaining banter between characters, there was a notable absence of character progression, leaving them seemingly unchanged from the game's start to near completion (I stopped right before the final heist).  Investing in properties within the game felt pointless; the money spent never returns, requiring an extensive grind to acquire them all, which didn't appeal to me.  Although there were enjoyable moments in the game, there were also instances where playing it left me with a sense of discomfort or unease. I won't delve into the portrayal of women in the game as objects or unable to exhibit ruthlessness. However, I found the inclusion of the therapist character puzzling. Was it intended as satire? Therapy remains taboo in many societies, so why not explore that notion? Why not play with society's perceptions of therapy? Instead, it seemed evident that the therapy sessions in the game were not genuine therapy but rather another aimless story arc, leaving me questioning its purpose and significance.   As for the online mode, it could potentially be enjoyable with friends. However, the high cost of items and the grind required were significant deterrents. While the concept of owning businesses seemed promising, the execution made it more of a chore than a pleasure. The delivery missions were time-consuming, the process of checking supplies at businesses in person felt tedious, and the excessive hours needed to play repetitive missions for incremental progress towards a new and improved business felt unreasonable."
Ye the online is kinda fun i guess
I have played this game for like almost 140hrs and the good thing is it is like a game in which there are jobs (Gta V RP) and I like franklin the most as i like driving and he has the driving ability.
shoe shop goes crazy

this game doesnt let my little brother yussuf load into the game.

Played gta 5 online for the first time in years was given money forcefully by a hacker within 10 minutes. Unable to do any public lobby missions because hackers will just TP to you and kill you. Crazy that one of the most popular games of all time is in such a state. Unplayable unless your in invite only lobbies.
"really fun played thru it twice and fuck around online sometimes. good for some dumb fun. the story is stupid as hell but it works. in summation, it's a stupid game but a good one"
good so so good

MY YOUTUBE IS  MSG_1900
sheshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  ilove this game
Needs bloatware to play. Avoid. Not sure why Valve even allows games like this that block paid purchases behind launcher. Denying someone something they paid for is theft.
siuuuuuu
"Rockstar hates it's fanbase.  No singleplayer content updates in a decade. In multiplayer its so tedious and lengthy to grind money for vehicles businesses, and they do this on purpose so you will bend and buy Shark Cards for real money. So naturally, everyone just cheats and hacks for money or vehicles that they want. Rockstar responded by adding the MK2 oppressor, which made it so griefers can kill you freely time and time again.  The game also has no anticheat, so expect to be trapped in cages, teleported, and having your whole ass game bugged and crashed for making the mistake of joining a public lobby.   Game takes forever to load, which makes it even more painful because 7/10 times you will error out, be sent back to singleplayer, then have to rejoin multiplayer. whole process to launch the game 5-10 mins on good PCs.  Cayo Perico is the only really valid option for earning good money, which is a pretty cool heist but gets old grinding it time and time again. I dont have a problem with grinding in games, but when it revolves around driving 3.8 miles across the map to the same spots time and time again its just boring.  at least they brought back beloved features from GTA 4 and Vice City, like Vigilante missions!! oh wait... actually nope it took them 11 years to even add cop cars you can own, and still no vigilante missions.  Will Rockstar learn from these mistakes in GTA 6? doubtful, they make $2.5 million per day off Shark Cards. why change a winning formula?"
Good STORY
Too many people have hacks in the game
Car theft go brrrrrrr :P
this is best game i played in my life
need more sex
rockstar launcher integration is very annoying
i   like
coko
"I liked this game a lot but the developed are dead set on minimizing as much enjoyment from it as possible. For me, my breaking point has been them showing us how fun this game could be with the cayo perico heist where you can make all the money you could want just for them to go back around and stomp it into the ground again because they wanted more money from sharkcards. Not to mention the fact that they thought doing that was a better idea the fixing the rampant cheating problem. This game has become a shell of what it used to be. Its just a fat bloated pile of shit begging you for more and more money."
game sick
gycj
I went to the high heel store  That's all I have to say

full of nigger trash

"this game is so fun, i like to go to the strip club"
It's GTA V omg
"Saw the GTA6 trailer, was very impressed, found out this was on sale for all of $10 including GTA Online. Scooped it. And I couldn't be happier.  The game is over 10 years old as of this commentary and I never got to play GTA4 yet, so it's been an enormous gap since I played GTA:SA on the PS2 (for reference, I've played since the very first GTA on the PS1, along with GTA2, GTA3, and GTA:VC as well).  The level of depth and immersion blew me away and would have had my teenage self floored because I played the older titles for their immersion. The story was so much fun to unravel, and I especially loved the Trevor character. The sheer amount of things to do were so many that I probably won't be able to 100% this game any time soon. But what really struck me was how faithful they were to referencing their older titles, including a car from GTA2 which is like the bastard child of the franchise it seems.  It's all the fun and frantic open-world destroy-everything GTA was always known for, with a massive city and a more rural county, chock full of weapons to play with, a load of cars of all different types that don't look repetitive after a while, new minigames and RPG elements,  The only sad thing is that, unlike GTA:SA, they had to remove the cities of San Fierro and Las Venturas, because that would have just made the world map so immense that this game would probably be so much bigger to install than it already is now. Still, with how deep they have been going, plus what I saw with the GTA6 trailer, who knows if they'll make some kind of alt-USA travel system to do this sort of thing and interconnect them along with Liberty City and Vice City (I'm looking at you, GTA Online).  100% recommend. It's the 5th major installment of a beloved franchise and it really delivers its entertainment, especially if you're into open-world immersion."
"From a singleplayer perspective, the game is nothing short of an excellent experience, the story isn't the best in the series but is a great parody of modern america. Each of the three characters have their own narrative that collides with each other to feel unique and relevant to the main plot. The choice of endings are obvious and not necessarily compelling which leaves a half baked finish to the game. But the first 2/3 of the game have excellent character development and writing. The open world is great but feels empty. Its more or less a travel hub to go from point A to point B, but has a good level of detail and almost every part is used productively. The online portion of the game sucks and is boring, using the same open world as single player with very few things different or interesting to see and do. Unless you have a small army of people to play with, multiplayer is a cash grabbing joke. The whole of the single player is what holds up to this day. 9.0/10"
"Rockstar, your decision to require a social club account even to play story mode is dumb as S H I  T T. Was hoping to come back from a hiatus but ended up uninstalling. Won't be buying 6. Done with this money grubbing nonsense."
I get to have sex 10/10

cool car game!!!!
"EDIT: After playing all this time on GTA online ive come to the conclusion that this game is absolutely killed by hackers and mod menus, GTA online does not feel like a safe game to play and for that reason I cannot recommend paying for this product. I personally like playing in closed sessions enough for it to be playable but if I had known how bad this hacking issue was I probably never would have paid 14 bucks for the game. Any time I am in a public PC session I have distortion effects on my screen, am being teleported all over the map or am being bothered in some other way by a hacker. They will make you randomly explode when walking, invert your screen and basically play god while rockstar only bans those who abuse the in game currency and have no care for the well being of their players or the experience they have online. Great single player game, absolutely horrible online experience and it has made me realize that I need to see this fixed when GTA 6 comes out or i will not be purchasing it.   Been a few years since ive played GTA V and last time it was on a ps4, coming back now in 2023 its almost like a new game online in some ways. Very good game overall and honestly its still worth 60 bucks even after 10 years of its original release date. Fun solo, fun with others and lots to do either way with what is still one of the most immersive cities in gaming even after a decade."

Online community is a bunch of unloved children, people who abuse mod menus to make it unplayable for others, and rockstar are money hungry and couldn't give a shit less about their player base. Not even a little excited for GTA 6 seeing how this garbage can of  a game is. I would not recommend to ANYONE"

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) stands as a true masterpiece in the gaming world, combining a sprawling open world, gripping storytelling, and an unparalleled level of detail.

"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  So not so recently Rockstar are slowing down and probably going to stop handing updates out to PC version of this game so if you really want to play go and play on a console while they still get updates.  Now why you shouldn't buy it really at all. Imagine this game is what we think of when we recycle a bottle, it get crushed down, a few bits of extra glass gets mixed in from somewhere and then turned into a new bottle. But at the core it's basically the same bottle. This is every single GTA update. Every one is recycled content. Ooo new mission added? It's basically drive, shoot a few people, look for a tiny thing not marked on the map drive miles back rinse and repeat. Want to earn good money? Either cayo or agency is your best bet, which would be fine but every damn mission is the exact same. All you're doing is the same thing over and over. It doesn't even feel like grinding it just feels like soul sucking stuff,  Rockstar are the worst. This game places first for most popular and most profitable game in the world. Breaking most records ever set. What do they do in return? Add subscription services, nerf money making methods, like cayo, prioritise consoles over pc, because Rockstar earn more from consoles than from PC, and increase the prices of everything while also nerfing vehicles and other things. I didn't even mention the fact they removed over 100 vehicles from the store only to make it so that GTA+ subscribers can get them. The worst part? It almost feels like a cult. You mention Rockstar is bad and have no shortage of evidence of this and then you get all these Rockstar supporters coming out of the woodwork telling you how you're wrong and Rockstar is better than god.  Yes I have nearly 1000 hours in this game and yes I still play from time to time but this is me telling you do not waste your money on this game on PC. Probably don't waste money on this game at all  Also Rockstar don't care. The game is full of modders and racist people and they don't do anything about it. Honestly one of the worst gaming companies going  TL/DR: Don't buy on PC - Rockstar bad - Everything sucks"
if u have rockerstar laugher and steam they start at the same time if u start gta5

Rockstar does absolutely 0 to combat cheating.
Best Game Ever Made from 2013
REALLY REALLY BAD  servers
Best Of Both Worlds....
"GTA V is a very amazing game, especially Director Mode, though i am sad about the fact that on January 30th i will no longer be able to play due ""End Of Support"" for Windows 7, 8 & 8.1 Which honestly makes no since as the game is still supported on Xbox 360 which is way older than these version's of windows, but i guess everything comes to an end, am i right? Other than that, this is one of the best game's i've ever played, can't wait for GTA VI and hopefully it will be available for windows 7, 8 & 8.1 but most likely won't be, so i hope i'll have windows 9 or above by 2025!"
i hate this game bro it crashes every two seconds
that game is so good for 18+
long live the king.
nicee good
I drive and run people over.
🔥🧑‍🚒🔥🧨🧨
"an open-world video game that makes you mentally insane  it's like an interactable movie, your character progresses from being in the hood to robbing banks, completing heists, and becoming a multi-millionaire genius (money earned legally)"
kobs
This game is really cool and u also can go to bitches
i recommend this game to all my childhood
wsws
why are the girls wearing bikinis inside a club

"greatest game off all time, everyone should play this greatest game"
Played for a year and it is still fun today
heeh
car go vroom pew pew
I've played this on my ps4 but GODAMN this is better 10x
gtav was neat until yknow.. didnt let me sign in.
"bought the agency, started a payphone hit and the mission (bonus) was to take the target's car and set a remote bomb on it but the problem is there were multiple cars and I had not even a hint of which one is theirs, ended up failing the mission trying to guess which car is the target's car."
GREAT GAME GRAPHICS ON P.C ARE MUCH BETTER THEN ON PS-5 OR XBOX AMAZING
Grand Theft Auto V (Five)
21 can you do some for me
개재밌노
very anoying sometimes and sometimes i feel like killing my self in this gamen and i can yippee
wad
rockstar dont have online server every time they this and now also they cant fix it.
"Drive here... drive there, drive back again... Online full of cheats and hacks, its pay to win. Its only real positive is Trevor in the single player and the personal expression and creativity in maintaining a cool garage of cars. But i`m done with this game, the cheaters ruin it."
Its nice and also i recommend LSPDFR
very nice game playing from 6 years best game ever seen excited for gtaiv
"“Maybe if you got rid of that old yee-yee ass haircut you got you'd get some bitches on your dick."""

This might be the last time I play Grand Theft Auto 5. The countdown has begin:)
"Not working, donation trashcan, where there are more cheaters than other players. Rocks updated -- game does not work, bruh. Strictly unrecommended to buy"
Very life changing

infested with modders impossible to play online
"Bad movement, running, driving, especially flying and swimming, trying to use oppressors etc. and crashes when im at the end of cayo perico often. fuck this game. (GTA5 good though)"
fucking excilence my nigga asured by hommie nigga

"great gameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee you can kill pedestrians and watch as t he ai sniffs its own ass lmfao; i mean multiplayer w ur friends is the best. the sidemen got me interested but turns out everyone plays thsi game. you can bug and glitch the game to high heaven, you can blow shit up and shoot literally anything you want, whats not to like? quests story mode, free mode, maps custom maps, idk you can shoot ur friends, if u dont ahve any u can queue with randoms high tehre mister bagele donuts,               RUSSIA would like ur sensitive spots                                                     info- spots."
you can kill police officers its good practice for real life
this game is good and cool and u play with others but the bad side of it is that there is a lot of people that like to mod and yea sometimes they will leave u alone but sometimes they don`t and they will spawn kill u or still your car or get u kick out of the game but over all when u are left alone its really fun cant wait for gta 6 hate that pc players wont get it first thing like xbox and ps

Very fun and cool
"Rami hy, chus a gai"
Single player is pretty great except for the way rockstar makes you fail a mission for walking 3 metres off their intended path.  I wish i could give a thumbs down separately for GTA Online which is a trash game for trash people.
The game is pretty good ive played on console and first time playing on pc
The Graphics.
Every server session is full of hackers.  its almost unplayable at this point.  completely defeats the purpose grinding away to purchase nice things only to be around godmode griefers.

Beast game if you like to get in a lot off of cop chases and rob places but need a good computer.
very fun with friends. kinda hard to learn the controls but once you understand them its very fun. plus you can do story mode which is kind easy at the start.

Super underated game!
"Yah know, its your classic rouge like dungeon crawler. Uhhhhhh, I really like longsword paladin build, but I've heard that people do well with a rogue type build. The perk system is very well fleshed out, I can't explain how it feels like I grow a year older with every point I invest. I really liked the side quest when Tiny Tina killed Ralof. The Steve Carrell cameo was really cool, he came on all like ""im the joker baby"" and then blowded up some buildings. I've never played GTA San Andreas. Shoutout Full Throttle energy drink. After enjoying some playtime everyone should take a brief moment to step outside to your nearest 7/11 or whatever boonk ass gas station you have around you and grab a nice cold delicious Full Throttle. It's the perfect thing to quench your thirst on a steamy hot day as well as give you that nice boost of energy. I find that it pairs well with a 6 milly upper decky zinneas and ferb and a brand new pack of newport golds to create the most delicious and palatable meal. Enjoy space coyboys!"
Probably my favorite game ever made. I hope GTA 6 matches or exceeds the love I have for this game.
Why did I moved here? guess it's just the community
this game is the best game ever and gta g is never coming out
100% play this game. best purchase ever
"It's GTA, it'll be great no matter what."
"The online game play, most part of the game is to travel to a long distance which will take around 10 mins and do some work like the part which you will feel like real playing, either killing or sneaking or something like that for around 1 min only. The same thing repeats for each and every mission. The heist setup is same . You will be asked to travel for most part of the game. Worst online setup. I'm fed up with this. Even though there are many ways to travel, it is irritating to travel for the most part of the game."
This is the best GTA game to date so far. Probably will be the second best once GTA VI comes out.
worth every single rupee
DO NOT BUY  WASTE OF TIME  NO PAY LONG MISSIONS EXPENSIVE MARKET GAMESHARK CARDS ARE USELESS  ONLY LOSER CONTENT CREATORS PLAY THIS GARBARGE
So nice steam 😘 Im very satisfied to steam account  And offers its so better then other  sites and aaps

best game ever made ;)
fun to play with friends
this game has consumed me
great game my favorite cant wait for gta 6
"its amazing... i mean what more can i say lol, use kiddions btw!"
bussin
really fun. requires commitment
good story w
Best!!!!
cuz its fire
game is really fun but there is too many moders spawning in blue whales and chimpanzees to kill me
Hit someone with a car
very nice game i'm waiting a new winter update
"The game is great, even 10 years after launch. But good God what on earth is up with with this puzzle solving verification. 20 puzzles that takes many minutes and you have to get all options right to be able to redeem a code after solving other puzzles... The nightmare goes on for at least 30 minutes. Fix this"
"An amazing game no doubt. People always say how the remastered is barely different from the old ps3, but I have played on a ps3, and let me tell you, theres a drastic difference, specifically the graphics, which people say (at least, the people I know) are barely changed. I see many differences in shapes, many differences in contrast.   My 2 gripes: Modders are a big thing in this game, expect to run into one or two a day. Also, some cutscenes have little to no work put into them, meaing that they are still good, but Rockstar apparently forgot to remaster certain parts. But don't worry, you won't see it often. Probably at most once or twice throughout your entier playthrough of the game."
Yo!Whats up Homies!!
just good
My 14 year old self has finally achivied the dream of owning and being able to play this game. I'll come back in the future when the same happens with GTA VI
No review required - amazing game and is perfect for the steam deck 10/10
best game ever made and i am willing to pay 1000 for gta 6
tttpig
ha npc go boom
i recondmend this game to people who like to rp and shii
"This is one of the incredible game which I had played ever, The graphics are realistic and you can experience the whole map of Los Santos and the missions are also interesting, I had played all the series of GTA, And believe me this game is incredible which is made by my favourite company Rockstar Game, I would highly recommend to play the GTA 5 game"
It is funny and the most realistic game you will get.
strip clubbbbbbbbbbbbbb
Fun as flip dude
hands down one of the best games ever made
classiccc
HE SHOULDA PAID THE NIZ-OTE!!
Unplayable online experience where modders can remote crash your game. Just play singleplayer.
"The game that gives common folks a chance to experience what being rich is like, also LA tour simulator"
i like killing npcs
cool boom boom
"good story, bad online, played on ps3"
waiting GTA VI
fun for the most part
this game cool
"Even though this game has been out for the longest, I still love it just as much as i did when i first got it highly recommend this game whether you're  just buying it or been playing and want to reinstall."
"Greatest Story telling in gaming, even after so many years"
G O O D
Its okay
HUH
guys we all know we are waiting for gta vi but i know a lot of you guys still play samp :) i love game franchise one of greatest :)
"Kept myself from paying GTA 5 for 10 years, but damn it was a good game."
"GTA V has generated $8 Billion Dollars in revenue.  For reference, Barbados has a GDP of $5.6 Billion.   Fiji has $4.9 Billion."
Still a lot of fun after so many years
man wtf
gooooooooood
its fun and open world
"honestly, this made me hyped for GTA VI since it'll just be this with better graphics and an updated map and vehicle/weapon roster.  I wouldn't rate this anything over a 7/10 due to the fact rockstar kept selling this for 10+ years and though it was acceptable. They only updated the GTA Online mode... so I'll give it a 9.2/10"
"The game would be great if it allowed me to play. I 'have' played this game before for a good while on my Steam account when I purchased it. But then, at some point it went free on Epic Games, then I picked it up there. After I tried it out there, I missed my save from Steam and the achievements. When I came back, the Rockstar Social Club says that I can´t use my account here because I already have a account on Epic, even though I made it here first. Point is, Rockstar support said they could´nt help, and Steam that I can´t refund, so now I have a unplayable game which just became a locked trash bin where my money was thrown."
people cheat but funy
shit ass
ignore the grind play the game
asssssssssssssssssssssssss
They removed everything fun from online.  All you can do is the boring repetitive missions.  Wanna have some fun in an open world?  Nope not allowed.  We built this detailed world and all the NPC responses but no you can't go in there.
gta v is super cool
"One of the best gtas. the online is great iv been playing the same character sense 2014 on my xbox 360, and the creators had the forethought to character transfer making it so i didnt waste my time. ill miss this game when its gone."
fdfdfdsfsdf
like how the game is still the same from when i originally bought it for my xbox 360 back in 2015 only thing is that the driving movement is shitty
This game made me horny over tonya
This game is very good!!!

MMMMMMMMMM TASTY  I LOVE DRIP FEED MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM FUCK OFF
GUUD
"This game sucks. Utterly. I thought this was Triple-A? 100 GB of garbage.  First of all, why the hell do I need a Rockstar account to launch the game? I'm not playing online, this shit should be opt out.  Second of all, to even log in to my Rockstar account, I have to go through multiple captchas (that will fail if you get even one answer wrong) that consist of 16-18 rounds of advanced spatial matching or 10 seconds of audio that you have to categorize.  Third of all, it won't even launch without 5 minutes of loading on a R symbol just to tell me that the game has already been launched, before quitting. Useless.  Fourth of all, get rid of the dog shit launcher. No game has EVER benefited from a launcher, save for perhaps MInecraft, where you need multiple profiles for different versions and mods.  I expect an AAA game to launch and work out of the box. What did I get? Half an hour of absolutely nothing. This game has been out for 10 years, and yet, somehow, it still needs work."
such a good story and they nailed the driving physics. The graphics have aged so well too. this is one of the greatest games ever made.
"Its GTA V, speaks for itself at this point"
"great game, loved this growing up"
Game is very Fun just be cautious oh people who like to grief people
stressful and soo many hackers but nvm its fun tbh
The GOAT
It a really fun game you can enjoy and play with your friends and have a nice time
i got banned because of a hacker in a online lobby i've been banned since last month and unnbanned jan 6 2024

"Rockstar continues to make absolute bangers. I write this review shortly after the GTA6 trailer has been released. After playing this game for years on multiple systems, i still find new things to do here and there, new ways to cause chaos, or new encounters. And thats just in the singleplayer mode. GTA Online is constantly getting updates and adding things to do or things to buy. You won't find another game that does what GTA does in this capacity"
"I think everyone knows about this game, so yeah, go ahead buy it, its amazing."

"Love how I can make money in different ways. Keeps me from getting bored with the game. Not a huge fan of the griefers but alas, GTAV is goated!!"
I like GTA V so much
If you are a gamer and have not played this game you deserve death.
"THE ONLINE IS TOO FRUSTRATING AND A MONEYGRAB  The singleplayer is an ok a regular gta game (story 8 to 10 hours of play maybe a bit more) where its ok till you have mission to earn money but when you finish them its a problem to earn (unless u go trought all the trouble of doing the investments in shares in the ingame interenet before the heists which is a PITA you need to do with a youtube guide)...(there are singleplayer cheats but not the money cheat like if the developers wanted you to feel poor and frustrated....)  online its just a nightmare it feels like a work but sorry im here to play not to work or i would have stayed extra hours at a real job, you start with nothing and you are going to get killed by other players a thousand times untill you get in private game to advance with some online missions and earn something so u can buy the basic weapons, but some missions cant be done without players in the game so you are forced to play with griefers (people that will purposelly ruin your mission because you cant literally do nothing against them when you start for lack of equipement) and cheaters which has filled the game and makes planes rain over u or just crashes the game spawning too much stuff or run around in godmode fucking everything up) and not only that it takes u soo much time to earn with missions that is as frustrting as a real job you dont like, and when you buy one of the basic things that you need to protect yourself from other players you are back to zero, unless u buy the in game money... with real money... -.- or u are lucky enough to find a hacker that drops money on you but guess what? if someone gives u money he is porbably gonna be banned and u too, but if you cheat without giving/touching the money no problem no bans, u can crash servers no one cares....  -.-'       i have been playing for a few years and i have seen those problems only getting worst, 1227.5h of play almost all online and more than 3/4 of it was just tring to earn ingame money without having fun to buy what i needed, i totally understand why cheaters are growing...  I tell you people dont buy this game and dont buy the next one from this developer they dont deserve your money, this shiny garbage has been made to suck either money out of you or all of your free time and patience, the next one will be no different.....dont feed the sharks people or more will come.....and no more fun games will be made just frustrating moneygrabs that looks appealing......"
BBC MANY BBC 🤤🤤🤤🤤 I LOVE THE SHOE STORE BEST. I MAKE SO MUCH MONEY IN IT!!

"One of the best Video game I have ever played, from the open world to the story to the freedom to do what ever you want, this game is so much fun, I play it ALL the time, which shows in that I have almost 600 hours in game"
game is the worst game made lagg cars ar like 300mil just to look at
It's just awesome
gta v Story mode is fun hasn't been updated in ages but  gta v online is garbage correction the  content is good like the cars and some of the buildings you can buy but you will be spending HOURS just to get one of the new cars or buildings or you can buy shark cards and wastes your money
c o o l
Masterpiece.
Very nice game xq
story
shark cards more like barf cards.
It was my dream to play this game since my childhood guess what dreams are coming true ! The Best game...
"Being what video games are, It's a fun game to play. I played all of the gta games over the years, starting from the very first one. Grand Theft Auto is a nice change from the fantasy/science fiction video games I'm usually addicted to."
no problems with it at all unlike rockstar's other games. just get it.
VERY YUM GAME
"[b]""[i]Why did I move here? Guess it's because Steam. You see.. screenshots, artwork, review, discussions, and guides. So, I bought it this year and I'll upload everything I have in mind.[/i]""[/b]  I rarely play the story mode, so I just go directly to Online mode to play with friends, doing heist and stuff. But after I bought it on Steam, I decided to play the story mode. Though I didn't finish all the random events / Strangers & Freaks, GTA V's story amazed me. Each mission, Each dialogue, Each moment is abso-fucking-lutely Grade-A. 3 protagonists with their life-stuff-problems to tell; A gangbanger, a father formely bank robber, and a fucking psychopath yet loyal become involved in a series of dangerous missions and heists, all while dealing with a dangerous group. [list] [*]Franklin with his desire to become something more & make something of himself which now he become a successful entrepreneur & multi-millionaire in GTA Online: The Contract. It's funny to see Franklin & Lamar doing their chit-chat. His best lines is always, [b]""[i]What?[/i]""[/b]  [*]Michael is a successfully retired & wealthy criminal that wanted to live a peaceful life with his family in Los Santos but slowly turns into a living nightmare. His best lines, [b]""[i]You forget a thousand things every day, pal. Make sure this is one of 'em.[/i]""[/b]  [*]Trevor. I don't know what to say but he's the fucking aggressive one. But I gotta say, he's very loyal & respects all those close to him. Trevor's first introduction include Johnny from GTA IV: TLAD and the moment where Johnny is beaten up till dead by Trevor. One of Trevor's best and funniest lines for me is when he is with Michael and tells him that he kidnapped Madrazo's wife, [b]""[i]What kind of fucking animal do you take me for? No, I didn't kill him. But I did kidnap his wife.[/i]""[/b] [/list] GTA IV also had 3 protagonists, but they were separated yet had one connected plot, while GTA V all in one standalone game and what's new is each protagonist has their own colours.   It's cool that GTA V has many awesome features. The main story now has playable heist missions, convertible cars can retract and deploy their top covers, weapons remain in the inventory after player died or busted, all the weapons are stored in inventory instead of replacing them, random events appeared randomly throughout San Andreas, and 3 protagonists in the same mission allowing you to switch characters during the mission.  Above all, giving me a Grade-A experience, a place with many activities, Online mode to have fun with friends and is still getting new content to this day (this year is Chop Shop), and [spoiler]it gives you patient report after finishing the story.[/spoiler]"
"Finally got something other than my PS3 to play GTAV and I can say, this is 100 times better. No lag, no modders, but I couldn't transfer my old account :("

"I like when Trevor showed up saying ""It's time for a Grand Theft Auto"" and Grand Theft Auto'd all over the place. Truly one of the gaming moments of all time."
Good👍
The best game ever.
"The story/singleplayer mode is one of the best games in the genre and while it's difficult to mod there are some fun mods like LSPD for singleplayer that let you play as cops or SWAT.    The official online gets a lot of hate but honestly it's not that bad these days. I only learned this when I started playing again recently, but last year they made some major changes that have reduced the frequency of griefers in public lobbies, as well as made some MASSIVE changes to the grind. You can now run just about any mission and heist prep on a private lobby, meaning you are effectively 100% safe from cheaters or random griefers when running these missions. This has effectively nullified most of the grinding as the only thing preventing you from farming gun running missions before was griefers, and you can easily get millions in a day for doing practically nothing through gun running missions, uninterrupted by players trying to kill you with jets."

"I have loved every GTA game; I bought it on release for PS1, GTA3, Vice, San Andreas on PS2.  Single player is excellent and worth buying if you haven't already experienced it.  However, GTA online for PC is absolutey f*cked and a fentanol-filled dumpster fire rolling down Vinewood Hills.  So much so that R* has already abandoned GTA6 2 years before its release on PC.  If you're buying GTA5 online then its probably so you can play it modded anyway or want to RP.   ""If you're not cheatin', you're not tryin'."" -Eddie Guerrero.  GTA5 on console may only be on life-support, (with GTA6 around the corner sucking up most of the development team,) but at least it's actually still getting support. Come join me on PS5 for a [strike]good[/strike] much better experience."

"No complaints, everyone loves GTAV."
"Best Game ever, even though its been a long time since it released, this is the best game i ever played. I regret for not buying the game much earlier."
cheaters
"It's a great game with a rich suspenseful story. Great memorable characters. Personally, I don't play online that much, mods keep me entertained in single player. If you're on the fence, buy it on sale. Well worth it."
"Been having this ACTIVATION KEY REQUIRED issue when starting GTA 5 game ,have the CD-KEY is also useless it says ROCKSTAR ACTIVATION CODE ALREADY IN USE. Read a lot of complain regarding this same problem on GTA 5 community but seems like theres no solutions. Thumbs DOWN for ROCKSTAR GAMES."
"The tennis game with Amanda was intense and I lost. This game taught me that no mater how many advantages you get your spouse will take them all back before crushing your dreams. I have never felt such disappointment as when Micheal lost over five advantages to a woman that he coached and is now better. She must have been Serena Williams in hiding, and she blew her cover. This game proves that no matter how many times you want to win there will always be a professional athlete hiding  in your daily life ready to ruin it forever.  In conclusion 10/10 game (The tennis courts did not get rained out.)"
I want to torture wade for being an absolute nerd.
Its the best game in the world hands down! :)
the game is unplayable its full of hackers and Rockstar aint doing nothing !

Tyler the creator
"[h1]I'm not a criminal, I'm a entrepreneur[/h1] [i]See you in GTA 6, if i'm alive then...[/i]  Grand Theft Auto V, the latest instalment in the controversial yet wildly popular franchise, delivers just that. First released in 2013, the game has since been remastered and optimised for PC, offering players a chance to experience this sprawling crime epic in stunning 4K resolution and 60fps.   Set in the fictional city of Los Santos, GTA 5 provides a vivid recreation of Southern California and all the seedy underbelly it encapsulates. The game offers a scathing and satirical take on the American Dream through its interweaving story of three criminals from very different walks of life.  [h2]Storyline[/h2] As you progress through the game, you are confronted with moral dilemmas and complex relationships in a world filled with crime, corruption, and the constant pursuit of power.  What sets GTA 5 apart is its unparalleled attention to detail and the sheer scope of its open-world environment. Los Santos evokes the feeling that it is a living, breathing city bustling with pedestrians, traffic, and countless activities to engage in. You could participate in street races, play a round of golf, enjoy a bike ride along the coastline, or visit a strip club.  GTA 5's story mode is a mammoth task, with any one of the characters - Michael, Franklin, or Trevor - providing enough narrative for an entire game. Combined, they offer an intricate plotline with the highest standard of writing. Once introduced, you can freely switch between these characters, each with personality traits and strengths.  Franklin, a streetwise hustler with a good heart, can drive in slow motion. Michael, in witness protection, tries to leave his criminal past behind. Trevor is an unpredictable and volatile character who thrives on chaos.  [h2]Gameplay[/h2] players can engage in various forms of gameplay, such as completing missions, participating in heists, and exploring the open world.  [h3]Shooting Mechanics[/h3] While the base shooting mechanics have held up reasonably well since 2013, there are now third-person cover shooters that feel more fluid. However, GTA 5's shooting is still immensely enjoyable.  [h3]Missions[/h3] With multiple approaches to complete objectives, you can tailor missions to your preferred playstyle. Whether employing stealth, direct confrontation, or strategic planning, the diversity of options ensures that gameplay never feels repetitive or monotonous.  The variety of missions and mechanics guarantees that players remain engaged and excited. You may enact a meticulously planned heist, engage in intense gang warfare, or embark on an adrenaline-fueled chase sequence.  [h3]Customisation[/h3] Players can shape unique experiences by changing outfits, customising vehicles, or exploring the open-world environment. The plethora of choices for players adds replayability even after completing the main story.  [h3]Open World[/h3] Players are granted almost total freedom to explore the vast metropolis of Los Santos and the surrounding countryside.  Driving through the city evokes a palpable sense of place, with responsive vehicle handling and collision physics creating an authentic experience, whether navigating dense traffic in a sports car or off-roading in a 4x4. Piloting aircraft opens up new vistas, from scenic coastal flights to heart-pounding aerial stunts. The open waters surrounding the city are equally inviting to explore by boat or submarine.  An astonishing array of side activities are scattered worldwide, from recreational pursuits like golf, tennis, and cycling to more illicit diversions. Stranger encounters introduce memorably eccentric characters and side missions with compelling self-contained stories. Collectibles like letter scraps and spaceship parts encourage exploration while revealing more about the world and characters, but no one knows this.  [h3]Driving Mechanics[/h3] The driving mechanics of GTA 5 are unrivalled, and constantly comparing other open-world driving games to GTA games like Just Cause, Watch_Dogs and Saints Row, just to name a few, doesn't even come close to the pure satisfaction I get from the multitude of vehicles I have at my disposal and how vastly differing they all feel to navigate through the streets of Los Santos.  [h2]Stunning Visuals for 2013[/h2] Everything from the character models to the buildings and terrain is meticulously detailed3. The lighting and particle effects are also remarkably realistic, showcasing beautiful sunrises and sunsets and how dust kicks up from off-road driving. These visuals, combined with the seamless transition between the city and the open countryside, make exploring the world a visually arresting experience.  [h3]Cinematic Soundtrack[/h3] The original score for GTA 5 was composed to create tension during action sequences and a sense of ambience while free roaming or completing mundane tasks. The game also features licensed music spread across 15 radio stations, including hip-hop, rock, and country genres. Players can simply cruise down the freeway and enjoy the scenery while listening to their favourite tunes.  [h2]Online[/h2] After nearly a decade on the market, GTA 5 Online remains a polarising experience. For all its ambition and scale, the game struggles to balance engaging open-world gameplay with an incentive structure that pushes players toward griefing and other toxic behaviour. Though recent updates have aimed to curb the worst excesses of the community, the problems run deeper in the very framework of how GTA 5 Online functions.   If you can find a group of like-minded players, there are glimpses of the promised fun and hijinks. But for most, GTA 5 Online is a cautionary tale of how even the most sprawling virtual worlds can feel empty when not built with community in mind. You may enter with an open mind, ready for adventure, but leave with a sobering reminder of the darker impulses that emerge when there are no consequences. For a game that holds up a mirror to society, it's a reflection we may not wish to see.  [h2]Conclusion[/h2] Overall, Grand Theft Auto V is an impressively ambitious and complex game that pushes the envelope of open-world gaming and storytelling. The massive scope of its gameplay and intricate story should satisfy even the most hardcore GTA fans. While not without its flaws and controversies, GTA V is a technical and creative marvel that provides hours of entertainment and escapism.   Suppose you want to immerse yourself in a satirical take on modern culture with engaging characters and non-stop action. In that case, you'll find it hard to beat this sprawling crime epic. With so much to see and do in the world of Los Santos, GTA V stands out as one of the most compelling open-world experiences in gaming."
Good Game. Fun. Funny. FuNnY nUmBeR hEhE xD. sigzty-nain
to many hackers and to many bugs

"Rockstar refuses to implement any sort of meaningful anti-cheat, IP obfuscation, and the same E&E update consoles received. I wish it wasn't the only game of its kind."

"Game requires admin rights.  Launcher requires admin rights.  Game requires Steam to run with admin rights.  Even with all rights granted the game is perpetually stuck in a loop where Steam launches Rockstar launcher, windows flags that as suspicious, asks if I want to allow it to make changes to my device, I reluctantly click ""yes"" and am greeted with the Rockstar launcher window where I have to click ""launch from Steam"" (uhh, I literally just launched from Steam).  This brings up an error window that says it failed to launch.  Verifying game files does not solve this problem.  I've owned the game for 9 days and have had this issue 3 times already.  I don't play online; I'm only trying to play story mode but the game no longer launches.  Steam refused my refund since I'm over 2hrs but save yourself the trouble...if you don't already own this old game, don't buy it here.  Or maybe even at all."

good game. Wish they would have added DLC instead of focusing on the shitty online mode

"i love getting spawn killed by griefers, 10/10"
"Kay i bought this game on console then it released on PC so i bought it there too...Rockstar social club has issues with me owning their games on steam or something because ive had to reset my passwords a million times just to be ALLOWED to play their games...now here i am once again trying to log into social club and play GTA V and its telling my my account is logged in somewhere else...1 week later of back and forth and i still cant play. Now i have heard people having issues with rockstar but HOOOOOOOLY crap they are absolutely useless.  I have sent them everything i can to prove i have the game, ive played the game and the game is mine and they still wont fix my issue...i offered to send them my DNA...they gave me no reply on that."
"Very fun game, story mode is awesome same with the Online!"
"There's a reason this game still gets updated to this very day. GTAV is a classic. I've largely played this game casually and still man aged to put in nearly 1500 hours. Good times. Gather some friends, cause some mayhem or play the single player campaign, it's all good."
i have a problem
its relly gudd
bravo
No children to run over
Fun c:
My account was hacked and Rockstar Support refuses to help even though I have showed proof of ownership
"really fun game, runs on my hd graphics 4600, so its not very demanding. Reccomended!"
very fun game love it
Fantastic story mode the only problem wit the story is that it ends but that can not be said for online.
"really cool when you get spawned on mount chilliad locked in a cage, would totally recommend"
this game never gets boringing
"Love it, it's an escape from reality"

Like doing hoodrat shit with my friends
"Online is full of modders, who grief other players for no reason and rockstar don't seem to do anything about it. The whole online part of the game is just an endless grind, but if you're not happy with it, you can always pay real money to get ingame cash, lol."
"Great game, but terrible company that lies to you. Or just simply scams you.  Single player mode requires internet connection. They say you need it once to activate, but after 2 days being offline traveling, game won't launch. I don't care about multiplayer, I want TO PLAY ALONE.  Now I'm waiting for Rockstar launcher to update for 2 hours on crappy mobile internet for no reason, since I don't need that stupid launcher.  You basically pay for crappy experience, while pirates have it better for free. If buying isn't owning (since I can't play it whenever I want), pirating isn't stealing."

Great game if you get enough ways to make money
Must Play

This game is UNPLAYABLE because of all the modders. Dont bother. Also to all of you dipshits that have enough time on your hands to grief people with fucking god mode on I hope you all die of dick cancer. Fuck you.
This game is really amazing the story is pretty good. Although I did accidentally corrupt my save file :( GTA Online is really good when you aren't getting hunted by high level players. I have made friends with people who do private lobbies with me to host high paying robberies so I can get cool cars. The one thing I have to complain about is the modders I ran into one and he said wanna see something cool so I said yea and he made me go from level 10 to level 105. I do admit it was my fault. It really messed me up because I had so little money for such a high level. Besides that I think the game is good.

Multiplayer is absolute shit it lags like crazy when getting into another players car. When playing missions the map doesnt load in until 30 seconds in and sometimes the characters dialogue just doesnt start on time so you cant do anything for minutes. The loading is so long it takes multiple minutes to load anything.

"I've been playing this game for about 2-3 years a majority of the time i play this game i have to play in friends only lobbies My experiences consist of getting locked out of my online account, locked out of gta v for 3 days couldnt even play story mode, spawn trapped in passive mode, prevented from leaving the game and closing the window because of spawn camping, lagged out of the game, my internet taken offline, falsely reported because modders and hackers got mad at me, locked out of all of my cars, even the cars in my garage and businesses, being constantly targeted for some reason even while hopping lobbies to get away, i get ddos'd and booted offline for killing a modder with a 1000$ bounty, crashed for going after their bounty, locked in a cage while in passive and set on fire and cant escape even in death, prevented from switching lobbies to escape them while they keep spawn camping me, i could drive around do nothing and still get kicked off the game, even playing in story mode ill get kicked out of the game and another thing making money in friends only lobbies only for it not to save due to ""connection issues"" and when i try to in a public session i just get targeted and lose all my money anyway so whats the point. All of these experiences are from dealing with modders and hackers in the game. slowly day by day its becoming less enjoyable for me to keep playing. As of December 27th 2023 I cant log into gta v at all to play the game that i paid for."
pros: you can drive around in a cop car and kill black people with a baton cons: there is no kkk suit
"Just don't play online, just don't."
luv it

i like to play gta online its fun
this is awsom
"I am still on the loading screen and it's thrilling, but I have heard it gets even better. I'm excited."
"its gta 5, if you haven't had your fare share of fun through modded races and just sheer fun of the dumb things you can do, what are you waiting for? its time to try!!!!"
"Literally can't even play GTA Online because modders keep kicking everyone 24/7, Rockstar is TRASH"

"Grand Theft Auto V: A Tale of Two Realities – A Stellar Campaign Overshadowed by Online Chaos  My experience with Grand Theft Auto V has been a rollercoaster of emotions, swinging between awe and frustration. While the single-player campaign is undeniably cool and engaging, the online portion of the game has left a bitter taste in my mouth due to the rampant hacking issues that plague the experience.  Let's start with the positive aspect: the campaign. Rockstar Games has crafted a narrative masterpiece with an engaging storyline, diverse characters, and a sprawling open-world that begs to be explored. The single-player experience is a testament to the studio's prowess in storytelling and game design, providing players with a captivating journey through the criminal underworld of Los Santos.  However, the real allure of Grand Theft Auto V lies in its online mode. It's a shame that Rockstar Games seems to turn a blind eye to the overwhelming hack scene that has infested the online realm. Hackers run rampant, and their presence transforms what should be a thrilling multiplayer experience into a chaotic and frustrating mess. From money hacks to invincibility cheats, the online portion of the game feels like a lawless Wild West where legitimate players are left to fend for themselves against the onslaught of malicious exploits.  The sad truth is that Rockstar Games, despite their immense resources and player community feedback, has not done enough to rein in the hack scene across all their games. This negligence not only undermines the integrity of the online experience in Grand Theft Auto V but also casts a shadow over the multiplayer aspects of their other titles. It's disheartening to see a company of such stature failing to address a persistent issue that has been affecting their player base for far too long.  As much as the campaign showcases Rockstar's brilliance, the allure of the online world is where the real fun is at. The fact that this experience is marred by the unchecked proliferation of hackers is a major letdown. Until Rockstar Games takes decisive action to curb the hack scene and create a more secure online environment, Grand Theft Auto V's online mode will remain a frustrating and unfulfilling playground for those seeking genuine multiplayer enjoyment."

"I've played the gta 5 story mode on my xbox one a bit long ago, i think this upgrade to my gaming pc is mid, although you can adjust your graphics settings.  Peformance is kind of better, I think this upgrade to pc is small for me. So I don't think it's good to buy the game all over on pc and ps5. If you already bought the game, you don't need to upgrade. Anyways the story is amazing and great, CHOOSE DEATHWISH"
i recomnd it if want to train ur skill for anything!

"Really fun game, my computer has to have gearUP booster to run. Other than that it is really nice, the story mode is top tier (if youre looking for a story), yet you also have online (if you want to just freeroam)."
"Every time I try to install the game or update it, it says that I am missing file privileges - I've tried everything. Please help!"
Best.game.ever

Waiting for gta 6 thats how good it was.
"This game simulate reality, is fun to play."
other than the constant trolls its a good game to play with a group for heist and missions online and the story is actually great too
Averge at best. GTA 6 is better to play.

"This game needs to be re optimized so that players playing on older hardware can still enjoy the game as well.  it sucks that i can run the story mode perfectly but when i try to play GTA online, my CPU is overworked and can t run the game at a consistent 60 fps."
this game has been out for ages and ive probably sunk thousands of hours between xbox 360 and pc. the game has gotten progressively worse with each update. the game used to be simple heists and gangbangs and now its become a game where the grind to get money has basically turned into a 9 to 5 job. it went from lets do a heist or lets rob this gang to well looks like i need to resupply my bunker so i can sell it for money i can use to upgrade my bunker so it can produce more stuff to sell from each supply run. the game has fallen from grace and with the recent deletion of some of the most iconic cars ive finally had enough. hopefully they make the next installment worth my time and money but i fear this series is over.

No time was the same there is enough content and branches to keep you occupied, I was close to being able to run the highest graphics at 60 fps. Locked the fps to 30 and was then able to bump up the graphics all the way."

"Impossible to play without the useless launcher. The account system is broken and won't let you link another account to Steam, so if you forget the password or the account (like I did) kiss the $50 you spent on the game goodbye. Fuck Rockstar."
Not really

"Definitely a must play, since I was a kid playing GTA III, Vice city and San Andreas was the only way of experiencing some sort of reality in games along with the feeling you can do whatever you want.  Story 10/10 - the back and forth between Michael and Trevor with a side of Franklin with the San Andreas vibe is awesome Gameplay - 8/10 - would like a bit more challenge with the shooting mechanics Graphics - 10/10 - for a 10 year old game, it looks stunning. Wish it had an enhanced edition with RT"
good game -_-
YAS TIHS IS TO MUCH FUN AND MOR ENJOY THAN ANY OTHER GAMES I AM TO HAPPY TO PLAY THIS GAME

good look out for oppreors
this is the best game ever you can ride cars for free and enjoy riding cars in off-road or you can kill people with guns i totally recommend  this game for 100 dollars
I liked it
i love hookers
"-Playing this game was like having a conversation with a brick wall—tedious, unresponsive, and it left me feeling pretty solidly unimpressed. The storyline? I'd have had more emotional investment watching paint dry. And don't get me started on the characters. They were about as memorable as yesterday's news. -I've seen more intuitive gameplay in a game of blindfolded tag with a group of cats. And bugs? Oh boy, it's a bug buffet! Glitches everywhere, like the game was sponsored by a tech-savvy insect population. -In summary, this game is a bit like the Titanic—lots of hype, but ultimately it left me feeling like I was sinking into a sea of disappointment. Save your money, buy a plant, at least they respond when you water them."""
this game is so awsome and i play it everyday
still holds up
Good game and Professional Team if with friend frfr
It's so entertaining
"its GTA you can't hate on it, simple"
hell

Waiting For Gta 6
This game is so fun
half of the time i have played is just rockstar launcher being counted as gta lol
its gta. if i need to say more you shouldnt be here.
love trevor
"the game wont allow u to bring ur progress form xbox or playstation, making u grind the whole game again just. the story mode is amazing and will always be the best story rockstar has made. so should u get the game yes if ur new, but if joining for consle no its better to keep playing on consle."
Ive spent over 2 weeks on console and it is a terrible experience for me because the agony you have to go through just a heist setup
fun =)
i didnt get the money i got and i cant find how to get it
"This is a very good game, i would recommend 10/10 story, action etc."
it´s gtav
Just dont play online and you'll love it!
wheres gta 6
i likey likey you should buy
It's been 42 fucking minutes and I haven't figured out the fucking audio bullshit Fuck this 2013 game This is why people don't like games that are this fucking old Can't wait for GTA VI so I can maybe play the fucking game
"Um yeah, It's super fun, way ahead of its time. The only problem is that after finishing the campaign, there are no more heists or things like that."
10% blood 10% boobies 10% drug dealing 10% drinking 10% idk gang rap 50% driving recklessly and not getting fined for it  great game tho
good game 18+
It's as fun as GTA 4
Its insane how busted the UI and matchmaking is for a game thats been out for a decade and extremely profitable. I've spent hours queuing just to play a single mission
GTA is a fantastic series and will continue to be. You can virtually do anything you want considering how old it is. Can't wait for GTA VI to come out
A lot of stuff to do and super fun
only 10ish years to finnish
"Well worth picking up by now if you haven't already for the single player. But the multiplayer is still riddled with bugs and full of hackers. Online is fun and has lots of missions and things to do, but is completely overshadowed by the few downsides, that being the game is still full of bugs, especially online, and be prepared to be stuck in a death-loop as the hackers spawn kill you time and time again.   Do better Rockstar!"
Wow Just Wow
good game still just as fun as when i was a kid
good Game PASTA
yall i use mods on here i use the nsfw mod omg its so real cause i have the rtx 4090 and omgggg i just nut everytime i open the game
BEST GAME OF ALL TIME W

"I have not really played any video games for thirty years.  A friend shared a few games with me recently and well, here we are...   WOW!!!   GTA V has my mind blown. I'm certain that most people are used to the speed, aggressive action, and the controllers with dozens of buttons and vibration features, but beyond all that is an insanely entertaining way to spend some time.  I'm so impressed with the story line and the game play that I've barely been able to appreciate the hard work and talent expressed by the graphics(which are otherworldly when compared to Metroid, Shinobi, Contra, etc.  In short, I cracked open a door and baby-stepped back into an awesome world that all started with GTA V.  Highly recommended, thanks for taking the time."
Outstanding game

"great gameplay, fun story. could be better in terms of replaying but all in all a good fun game."
Played almost 30 hours. Not a bad game but it was over-hyped to me. Not worth $30.
lots and lots of swearing almost had to uninstall because of it but in the end it was so much fun playing always pick ending C just trust me. Franklin was my favorite
"good game, too many cheaters"

Shoe store has good shoes 👍
"Gameplay - 8/10 Whilst some people may dislike the Rockstar gameplay formula as it certainly isn't for everyone, I like it and it has made me come back to the story missions of this game about 3 times across all the platforms that I have played it on now. The gun play in this game is satisfying for me as the guns really feel like they have power behind them. Driving mechanics are fun and easy.  Story - 6/10 I wasn't too interested for most of the story and, whilst there were some cool mission based around the story and some funny moments in the cut scenes, it was mainly the gameplay that kept me playing.  Graphics - 7/10 The graphics of this game still hold up quite well today and I'm sure they will for a while. There are little details in some models that make the game world feel real and like there are many moving parts to each object. Explosion and fire effects still look good and are satisfying to watch.  Performance - 9/10 I had some performance issues when I first started playing this game on PC but I have put that down to driver issues as they have disappeared since.  Online - 6/10 Personally, the online never really interested me much but I think that it is mainly down to the fact that I don't have a group of friends that I can play it with to properly get into it and that would keep me coming back. There is plenty to do in the online for people who like that sort of stuff though. I just personally prefer single player games.  Overall - 9/10 If you haven't played this game yet then I would recommend that you do so before GTA 6 releases within the next 583.29 years."
so fun i love it

I luv u
Good story mode. Online is crazy. This game is one of the best released. Can't wait for the next game in the series!
money hungry company that doesnt really care for its player and the online system is awful
"I never thought I'd be allowed to own this game... but now that I can I must say that even after all of these years it is a masterpiece in every way possible and continues to prove to me that games do hold up nicely even a decade after launch. Although online has its flaws with modders on pc, I really don't have anything bad to say about the game. I'm genuinely so excited to see what rockstar has in store for us with GTA 6."
really fun game on the acer nitro 5 REALLY GOOD EVERONE GO BUY GTA NOW!!!!
Fun game. Endless shit to do.
hyväpeli
still one of the best games
"Retards, hackers and pavel make this game good"
w game fr fr ong
pedestrians crumble to the groudn its so awesome
WOW!
"Even as someone who doesn't like much action in games and more story, i actually like this game, its fun to just fuck around and not have any consequenses and the story is pretty intruiging!!!!"
i enjoy the online experience mostly for the vehicles you can operate and the many areas you can ramp off and whatnot. the campaign is also pretty awesome for those real in to the story element. i would recommend this game for having fun with friends.
Gta Online is full of modders thats that they dont haver a proper anticheat. Its a joke that the game is out for that long and still runs so bad
this game so fun but be aware someone might hack you outta nowhere so you can just download fivem

"Do NOT play this game. I played this game and I started to feel sick. The next day, when I went to the bathroom, I literally threw up blood everywhere. The next game, I had to get surgery cause my organ was failing, which is why there was blood, I think. I then died. Games are violent and shouldn't be allowed anymore. God save you if you play this game."

"A Modern Gaming Masterpiece: GTA V Review Rating: ★★★★★ After investing a staggering 793 hours into Grand Theft Auto V, I can confidently say that it is an absolute gaming masterpiece. Rockstar Games has once again delivered an unparalleled open-world experience that surpasses all expectations. The level of detail in Los Santos is mind-blowing. Every street corner, building, and NPC feels alive and vibrant, creating an immersive environment that constantly begs to be explored. The attention to detail is remarkable, showcasing a level of craftsmanship seldom seen in gaming. The storyline is gripping, filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. Each character has a distinct personality, and their intertwining narratives provide a deep and engaging experience that is both humorous and emotionally charged. The gameplay, too, is exceptional. The controls are smooth and intuitive, allowing for seamless transitions between driving, shooting, and participating in various activities. From high-speed police chases to intense heists and exhilarating stunt jumps, there is always something to do and a sense of freedom that is unparalleled. GTA V boasts an expansive multiplayer mode that further amplifies the game's longevity. Whether it's joining a crew and engaging in epic battles or simply exploring the vast open world with friends, the multiplayer component provides endless hours of entertainment and camaraderie. Furthermore, the constant updates and DLCs released by Rockstar Games have kept the game fresh and exciting. From new vehicles and weapons to challenging missions and events, the developers' commitment to the game's ongoing support is commendable. However, it's worth mentioning that the game does contain mature content and violence, which may not be suitable for all audiences. While it successfully explores darker themes, it's important for players to approach it with maturity and awareness. All in all, Grand Theft Auto V is an exceptional game that has undoubtedly become a cultural phenomenon. With its stunning visuals, captivating narrative, and an expansive open world that begs to be explored, it is a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. Despite the countless hours invested, the game continues to surprise and captivate me, making it a definite contender for the title of the greatest game of all time. I cannot recommend GTA V enough. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to the world of GTA, this game is a true masterpiece that should not be missed. Happy gaming! Note: The rating and review are based on personal experience and may differ from individual to individual."
The best game in history❤

"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients:  1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie  Directions:  1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

Nice game but better you play with you friends
maza aya
GTAVI when
it is very sexy game
Regarding GTA 5 ONLINE. The missions do not pay well enough because Cockstar wants us to buy shark cards. The whole game is just a platform to sell shark cards from. It seems they purposely make the missions unenjoyable to coax you into buying shark cards. I have uninstalled this  garbage.

"NB: I haven't been a fan of the series (though I enjoyed RDR2 a lot), so if you are or want to try it out, maybe this review isn't for you. Also, as I understand, the overwhelming majority of people now buy it for Online, which I also don't care about, this is about the single-player mode.  So, I've played quite a few huge sandbox games. I've even 100% (or close to 100%) completed quite a few. Why does GTA V not work for me in that regard?  Well, really, the answer is quite simple: despite being a huge open world with many, many activities you [b]could[/b] do, I don't particularly care to actually do any of them. It is honestly quite baffling as to how much work the game developers have put into things that just seem... completely out of place and pointless. You can do parachute jumps! You can play tennis! You can do plane stunts! You can do a triathlon! You can buy property! You can participate in car races! You can do yoga! You can play golf! You can buy and sell stock on the stock market! You can use your inconvenient phone camera which makes you stand completely still while you use it to take pictures of wildlife that kills you in one hit!  But is that really why I'd play a Grand Theft Auto game?  Sure, there are still the main missions, and a few side ones, but completing ALL of them took me less than 40 hours, and that included some messing around, which is quite a feat for a large sandbox.  But here's the thing: I didn't [b]actually[/b] complete all of the side missions. Why? Well, because I have no way to know how to do that.  One issue is that some side missions seem to be locked behind buying particular properties, which is not only completely not-obvious (especially since not all of them do that), but also requires you to either finish the game (to get any money to spare), or abuse the stock market system, which, due to its own quirks, can be quite hard to do without a guide. Others are ""random"", as in, while they have specific points where they can trigger, you wouldn't know what these points are (without a guide), and they might [b]not[/b] trigger there even if you're nearby purely by chance. Yet others require even more obscure ways of starting them.  Lastly, there are several collect-a-thon missions in the game, but, seriously, screw them. No markers, no clues, no nothing. Apparently, one of the protagonist trio can use his dog to search for [b]some[/b] of the collectibles, but the game never explained it or that it's even possible, so good luck figuring that without a guide. And even then, you'd need to run around the huge map to do this.  It's a good thing that I didn't even try to get 100%, though, because, apparently, one of the completion marks requires the use of a separate mobile app... which has been, at this point, removed from stores. Womp-womp.  Gameplay-wise, GTA V feels smoother than GTA IV, though that's not saying much. The flight controls are as horrendous as ever, going for completely misplaced realism. The police are cheating bastards who know what your location is at any point in time, can spawn out of thin air, and have cars that rubberband to you no matter what, making upgrading cars for speed pretty much pointless. Your health regenerates only up to half, and there are rarely any health pick ups (and no armor pick ups), forcing you to stay in cover most of the time in a shootout.  The story is not very gripping either, mostly concerning not particularly likable people doing things for extremely petty reasons. The best part of the game are heist missions, purely because of how you get to choose how they go, even if in reality there aren't that many ways your choices affect them, bar the one major one on the selected approach method. Unfortunately, there are only a few of those throughout the entire game, and I honestly don't know why else would I recommend it."
"Great game especially with friends. The graphics are really good and the game is very well optimized as well (even an entry level computer of today could run it well). There are also lots of things to do in this game. Stuff like messing around, missions, heists, mini games, story mode, etc. Like seriously, theres an insane amount of stuff to do. The game has so much play value.   What I like most in the game was the heists, the challenging content of the game (doomsday heist), playing with friends, collecting cars and weapons, messing around, and the environment.   The game is worth every penny, I highly recommend it!"

the best game ive played
big rob and i jerked off to stripper

Classic that never gets old.
"Game have a variety of stuff to do like shootouts,cars, businesses planes boats almost anything you can think of you can do in here just watch out for mods if you play on PC."

I Like game
Rockstar Games ♥
Nothing
IT's the GOAT Rockstar made.
You updated the game. Now I can't play it. What did you do?
"If a game as greedy as this can't steal your money, they'll steal your time and effort instead. The story's very fun, but for christ's sake do not boot up the online mode, no matter how cool the new update looks. There are more fun things to do with the grinding you'll need to even TRY it."
I LIKE because it fun
this is a grate game
"Very optimized port of the game. Unfortunately can't play the game fully offline because of Rockstar Games Launcher DRM, which is a downside.  EDIT: I can no longer recommend this version simply because of how predatory and broken the Rockstar Games Launcher is. Everytime I use it, the launcher always finds a way for me not to play GTA V and other Rockstar games. Just recently I've ran into an issue involving the activation of my CD key through the RSG. This won't even let me play the game because they want to completely ignore Steam's DRM and security for games in favor of their own proprietary security measures. This ultimately harms the experience of the players in the name of money. Therefor, I cannot recommend this game at all."
grrd
"You can't play singleplayer without online functionality. Nice job, Rockstar. (Context: My old Social Club account got hacked and I'm trying to make a new one. Support's being slow in unlinking it.) Make a glorious game and years later lock it behind an already shoddy account system EVEN WITH SINGLEPLAYER PLAY!  (Got my account linked to Steam back after days of hassle with support. Really shouldn't lock singleplayer stuff behind online stuff, anyway. That's scummy as hell.)"
VERY FUN WITH FRIENDS MONEY SPENT WELL
"lazy ass online updates, make actual content instead of shoving out overpowered cyperpunk piles of shit at a premium for sharkcard sales."
the shoe store aint a shoe store
im nutting the sec gta 6 come out
Saints Row clone
Loading Screen Simulator Loading fails after 10 years!!!!
FUNNNNN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVERRRR
"Grand Theft Auto V stands as a gaming titan, a masterpiece that defines the open-world genre. With a rich narrative, three compelling protagonists, and an expansive, meticulously crafted world, it sets an unparalleled standard. The game's enduring popularity and groundbreaking design secure its place as one of the greatest games of all time. In every aspect, GTA V is a triumph of storytelling, gameplay, and technical achievement."
Its just fun
Fine I guess I'll play it again Rockstar has me by the balls and they really know just how to squeeze em
Its the best one but it should look like more realistic to catch your eyes
I made a review before GTA VI comes out
10/10 no others words to describe it buttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt online 5/10
great content
meh.
Yes. Very Nice
type shi
Its GTA that is enough to play this game
kool game 👍👍👍
this game is so toxic but who tf cares niga

"Can fuck FREAKY ASS Strippers and Prostitutes.  Shit Mad Lit NBS LmAo. loL,"
This game is shit (this is the best game to ever exist)
nothing more to say its gta its fun
monk
the  best theft game ever
"This is the first GTA I've ever played, and probably the only  one I ever will.  Not because I didn't like it, but because I absolutely fell in love with it, and I genuinely don't think there's any topping this game -I guess we'll see with GTA6!   This is obviously a labour of love, and as someone who also loved both RDR games, I was still blown away by the quality in this game. The characters and actors are amazing, and the story is that perfect blend between comedy, drama and parody.   I have an issue with some of Rockstar's janky mechanics in some places- and some side quest are more infuriating than fun, but that's not exclusive to this game; it's just  Rockstar thing xD  Very very very good game, great quality and detail."
Good times
the best of the best
I love this game.
best of the best
nice love it
Good strip club :)
o.O
REALLY FUN GAME FOR KIDS UNDER 8 YRS OLD
The All time fav game!
"It always needed more story line content, I've never liked the online part of this game it's just not for me and it is full of A-holes that just want to ruin your game and unless you have lots of user stats no one will join your missions, but I love the story I must have restated it twenty or so times over the last ten years. I am looking forward to America today Oh I mean GTA6 but I hope it stacks up to 5 and engages the world not just more Go America number one crap because guess what you ain't even in the top ten."
"Do not get this game, they have the WORST customer support. Example:  >Russian guy hacks account  >Russian switches email on the account to Russian account  >I notice this happened when I tried to log into GTA  >Contact support  >Support says ""We can help but we need to verify the email on the account first.""  Like wtf dude and oh I can't unlink my steam either because you want me to verify the email on the account? Understandable except I DONT OWN THE FUCKING EMAIL ON THE ACCOUNT, SOME RUSSIAN HACKER DOES YOU IDIOTS. God damn. Please PLEASE do not buy this game until they figure out their shitty ass service.   Also the cherry on top of this is even if I WANTED to buy more Rockstar games (which I will not do anymore) I can't because the email being linked to my steam prevents this specific steam account from playing on any other god damn account. YIPPEE!"
very gud gud
10/10 Instant Classic when released in 2013.
NICE GAMES
CAR
wait for GTA 6 to come out.
"Good overall game, lots of things to do and beautiful graphics"
its a really good game and i will play gta6
GTA VI was better
dopest game ever
"I kept playing to see why so many people love the online side of this game and I eventually came to the realisation that it is just a bit shi.t and people must be complete morons to actually enjoy it.  Like it's GTA, it was fun to go back to something I've not played in nearly ten years, it's nice to revisit the map and having some new characters, campaigns, vehicles and things to do but that's it. The game has not improved, combat and character movement is still awful, driving gets boring quickly and all the new jobs, missions, heists and vehicles feel tacked on, nothing actually feels new or very interesting.  The worst thing is the actual online side, everyone is there just to prevent regular players attempting missions or trying to start missions. I understand people messing about with new vehicles they've bought but it's just so lame that that's what some people do every night of their lives, it's almost as douche as buying hacks or even worse buying in game money from Rockstar. My worst personal experience was a multiplayer mission where at the end everyone was spawned together so one players killed everyone else and stole everyone's money. Good Game design.   You can get away from all the other online players by selecting a new session and invite only, but this only really helps if you want to play solo. My main interest in the game was to play coop with a buddy, it's doable but it's a total ball ache as you will spend almost half your time in loading screens, you can't just play together as you constantly have to invite the other player to do something and if you finish a mission together then you are both put back into separate lobbies.  I wish I hadn't bothered with the online, the only thing that it's taught me is that Rockstar seriously needs to pull some magic off for GTA6 to be good, I'm sure it's going to look incredible and be an insanely detailed world, just like RDR2, but they need to reassess their gameplay unless the only people they are catering for are twelve year old boys with ADHD."
"1 out of 10 gameplay experience.    So I decided to finally try a GTA game, and this PoS wouldn't work 20 min in.  It crapped out on a loading screen.  It turns out that this has been a problem since 2015.  It's almost 2024 now.  Well, definitely not getting the sequel on the consoles considering they can't fix an issue that's 9 years old.  I'll keep trying to play through the game and if the problem manages to get resolved then I'll change my review."
Game is fun. Also reminds me a lot of GTA San Andreas which I played for cooountless hours as a kid <3

"GTA 5 has generated $7.7 billion in revenue but they still cannot fix the modding problem, despicable !"
"Logged 888 hours into GTA V – a 2013 gem that's aged like virtual cheese (in a good way). Graphics are surprisingly solid, and my character's dance moves are... well, they're a work in progress that's not being worked on.  The plot? It's not Pulitzer material, but it's like that B-movie you secretly love. Unlocked every achievement after countless hours, so you can trust my expertise. If you haven't debated life's mysteries with NPCs or turned Los Santos into your own chaotic playground, you're missing out. And seriously, if you haven't tried flying a jet onto the Maze Bank Tower, you're not living your best GTA life."
"Great game, do recommend."

"After watching GTA VI trailer i decided to brush up on my memories by playing ""the classic"" (unfortuantely GTA sa. disappeared from the steam and i had to play this) (JOKE ALERT) Seriously speaking i remember 14-years old me trying to play this on 2-core prossesor and gt630 with 4 gb ram ddr3. Low settings, windowed mode and 60+ fps. Now having bought this game (at 77 percent off) i set all the graphics settings to high and having fun and pleasure of incredible story and shitty online, (my friend and i were disappointed by that one) What i know for sure is that i'm gonna buy PS5 specifically for GTA VI."

"in this season of GTA5, Ai returns to protect little nikki's (You) glass house from other people you don't know online talking trash. Personally If these clowns can't handle a mute button or talking smack like an old school XBL lobby they clearly no need be playing this game in the first place. Granted, I can't stand hearing some Randy naggerguy poppn off the n-bomb every other 2 words, but for some reason that how some people communicate IRL; when this happen IRL too I do the same thing as in game, IGNORE/MUTE, but lets not talk about the blatant hypocrisy of what is going on while playing this game like stealing, boofiing drugs, banging prostitutes, and murdering NPC's like it ""No Russian"". What people liked about GTA is freedom, and looks like Rockstar is caving to the tiniest population in history ever recorded of all sorts of rando alphabets that whine and cry to get their way with products and services that aren't even theirs, vs actually making something (new game IP)  or improving an an existing product (MOD), you know like how capitalism works.... play if you want, but don't be buying shark cards to promote this anti-american anti-game anti-freedom BS that they have implemented."
if u have a good pc then this is the Best game every introduced to world
almost beautifull game
"The games is great an all but don't buy the pc version if you wanna play Online Do yourself a favor and get the PS5 or XBS X/S version of the game, rockstar seems to privilege those version anyway and at least there, you wont be at risk of randomely getting banned  when you go to bed after a private sessions with the boys"
Amazing game even tho the gta vi will be better
Great Game Plus You Know what i s  t h i s this had game of the year one bad thing is the cheaters hope they go to hell

Best GTA Game Ever
God play grand theft auto v    And online
"I pre-ordered this game on Xbox 360 and just purchased it the other day here on Steam. I love the pc version. I can mod the game now lol. It's so much better than it used to be. Not because I notice any story mode differences, but because the graphics are way better! With visualv I made things extra nice. I'm excited for GTA 6. That game is going to be nuts. I have a feeling some sort of VR capabilities may be included at some point in time. Now THAT is something I can come to enjoy lol."
gta 6 is coming
Womp womp
"I love this game. The graphics using my RTX 3070 TI Graphics Card are amazing, i would want to see more updates on online before GTA 6."
gta is a good game if you are very bored i play gta after school evrey day

Fire game
"Because of Rockstar's over-restrictive DRM, I am unable to play a singleplayer game I paid money for.  To be able to play the game at all (even ""offline"" play), you need to sign into a Rockstar Social Club account.   Having first launched the game years ago I used a Rockstar account I no longer have access to. No big deal I thought, I'd just make a new one and sign in.  Nope. You are not allowed to use a different Rockstar account than the one you first used with the Steam account. I opened a support ticket with Rockstar and they told me tough cookies.   So I am unable to play a game I own, despite having bought it on this very Steam account. Never buy from Rockstar I suppose."
Vrooooom vroom EEEEEEEEE BOOM. PRRAHPRAAHPRRAA PRA PRA PEWPEWPEWPEW.   fuck you lester.
we got gta 5 before gta 6
"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Brawnys recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients:  1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter 2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 4 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional) 1 cup chopped nuts (optional) Instructions:  Preheat Oven: 1. Preheat your oven to 175°C. Grease the baking pan or line it with parchment paper. 2. In a medium-sized saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Remove from heat once melted. 3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. 4. Add the melted butter to the dry ingredients and stir until well combined. 5. Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next one. Stir in the vanilla extract. 6. If desired, fold in chocolate chips and chopped nuts to add extra texture and flavor. 7. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter). 8. Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for about 10-15 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before cutting. 9. Once the brownies are completely cooled, cut them into squares or rectangles. Enjoy!  Feel free to customize this recipe to suit your preferences. You can add ingredients like caramel swirls, different types of nuts, or even a sprinkle of sea salt on top for an extra special touch. Enjoy your delicious homemade brownies!"
"Its GTA V, if you need to read a review just wait for gta 6."
haha rpg go boom
my game has ben haked
yes its very good but so far i havent been able to finish online heist due to teamates either being very bad at it or just leave sometimes kinda buggy but doesnt affect overall gameplay as a beginner i still havent left this phase despite having almost 250+ hours why u may ask earning money is just kinida hard for me especially my friends doesnt play with me much
GOAT of 2013!!!!
"Easily one of the best game I've ever play. Online is good, but I rather go into private session though."
absolutely hit
what's there to say but how awesome this game is
funni game
This company is not friendly towards PC players.
"It is an amazing game, worth playing with different ways to experience and explore open world, missions and making your way to the top by earning money and opening your own businesses. Worth playing, give it a try!!!"
ewerithing
very good ngl
"40% Gameplay 60% Loading Simulator but at least we got this:  Ah, _____ don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful _____. Maybe if you got rid of that old yee-yee ass haircut you got you'd get some b****** on your d***. Oh, better yet, Tanisha'll call your dog-ass if she ever stop f****** with that brain surgeon or lawyer she f****** with, _____...  Fill in the blanks."
do i even need to say whats good about this game?
how you not like that game?
"Quite possibly one of the best GTA titles out thus far and definitely one of the best games I've played. The number of hours I've logged in multiplayer or online on this game testify to how much fun this game can be if you have enough friends online, and if everything is working properly."
• Beautiful graphics • Great story • Open World • Ability to play for 3 characters • Memorable characters • Grand Theft Auto best game ever
This is an amazing game for every one. No one can bored in gta 5 and the graphics are awesome.

"GTA V online doesnt work on my laptop. it tried everything, port forwarding and even turning off my firewall. IT STILL DOESNT WORK"
best game ever made.
nice online mode
BERJUDI YESSSS
buy it and drive
goood game but this game only pc not play in mac
cant wait for gta 6
yes good
You know why
"Great game. Amazing. Its vey addictive. Its GTA V, do I need to say more? ITS GTA 5."
"Loading screen locks half the time you enter a building Every single lobby has at least one god mode modder They still add new missions and cars all the time without fixing previous issues Heists are like trying to wrangle 3 disabled chimps almost every time There are people who spam chat advertising their mods with no repurcussion. They also use loud ass sound effects to get your attention or they spam text you in game, which is almost as annoying Each lobby has at least one child that asks for money drops almost the entire time There are people who will specifically target a person and just kill them over and over to try and get a reaction. Usually if you say nothing they'll leave you alone after the 5th one  TLDR; sail the high seas for this one and just play singleplayer, rockstar doesn't deserve your money until they prove they can design a multiplayer infrastructure that doesn't allow for RCE"
Is gta5 who else doesnt love gta5
Please fix the modder situation on PC. Where hell is expanded and enhance for PC?

"One of the best games I have played in my life, We will never forget this game and it will remain mentioned in history."
story mod is not good but online is the best game ever
"I am so glad i purchased this game. I was playing pirated version of Grand Theft Auto V for the past 6 years, when i decided to say ""Fuck it"" and purchase the game. Ever since i did, my life became much better. Now i can play Online, my girlfriend called me again to be together with me, and my father came back from the store with an actual milk bottle!"
NARUTOOOOOO
"Rockstar has turned into a bunch of Cheaters. It feels like every possible thing that they can do to f*ck up your missions, they do. Your vehicles dissapear from where you leave them mid mission, traffic plows into you in ways so obviously deliberate everyone knows it, missions are laid out to force you to lose shipments, and the only thing that they care about is hackers with money codes, all other god mode griefers are allowed to roam unchallenged because they LIKE when they mess up your missions. And now, Rockstar has had 10 years to come up with new ways to cheat players for GTAVI. I think I will sit the next one out, I dont think they will be easing off on their jack booted methods to get players to spend money getting around overly excessive grinds."

you're a good kid Franklin
"After playing this game, I became a GTA hater. The design of the stages is attractive, but in general, the driving mode and gunplay are awful, and it is difficult to earn money, and the artificial intelligence of the police is as if they will attach a tracker to you and find you wherever you are. Compare game stores with Mafia 2 and many other things. In my opinion, this game is sh*t, and if it wasn't for adding a cheat code to meet the needs, the game will force us to either use the cheat code or spend thousands of hours collecting money.And I wish I hadn't bought this game"
its gtav cmon only thing is the mf modders lmaoo having funt times with them tho too
i mean its gta but i dont like how they fucked cayo
Si si si no si no quizas pero quizas si pero no se.
"If you need to be told why you should get GTA 5, you live under a rock or you don't like cool things."

need to release gta 6 already but i havealways liked gts5
"""Grand Theft Auto V"" (GTA V), developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, stands as a magnum opus in the gaming industry, redefining open-world experiences and narrative-driven gameplay. Originally released in 2013 and continually updated, GTA V remains an enduring masterpiece that seamlessly blends a vast, immersive world with compelling storytelling, unparalleled attention to detail, and a plethora of activities that captivate players for hours on end.  The visual spectacle of Los Santos, the game's fictional representation of Los Angeles, is nothing short of breathtaking. The meticulously crafted cityscape, diverse landscapes, and dynamic weather effects contribute to an ever-evolving and living environment. Character animations, facial expressions, and the sheer scale of the game world showcase Rockstar's commitment to pushing the boundaries of gaming visuals.  At the narrative core of GTA V are three protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—each with a unique personality, background, and skill set. The intersecting storylines provide a rich and multifaceted narrative that explores themes of crime, ambition, and the pursuit of the American Dream. The character development is masterful, creating a compelling emotional connection with each protagonist, even as players navigate the morally ambiguous world they inhabit.  The open-world design of GTA V is a triumph in player freedom. The sprawling city and surrounding areas offer an abundance of activities, from high-stakes heists and adrenaline-fueled car chases to more leisurely pursuits like golf and yoga. The attention to detail extends to the dynamic ecosystem of the city, with pedestrians going about their lives, engaging in conversations, and reacting realistically to the player's actions.  The game's driving and combat mechanics are refined and responsive, offering a satisfying blend of realism and accessibility. The vast array of vehicles, weapons, and customization options provides players with the tools to approach missions and free-roaming in their unique style.  GTA Online, the multiplayer component of the game, further expands the experience. It allows players to engage in various cooperative and competitive activities, build criminal enterprises, and explore Los Santos with friends. The ongoing support from Rockstar with regular updates, new content, and events ensures that the online experience remains dynamic and engaging.  The soundtrack of GTA V deserves special mention, featuring an eclectic mix of genres and a curated radio station lineup that adds depth to the game's atmosphere. The voice acting, led by stellar performances from the main cast, enhances the overall cinematic quality of the experience.  While the game has received criticism for its mature content and occasionally controversial themes, it undeniably represents a pinnacle in interactive storytelling, offering players an unprecedented level of agency in a virtual world.  In conclusion, ""Grand Theft Auto V"" stands as a titan in the gaming industry, seamlessly blending an expansive open-world environment with a gripping narrative, exceptional character development, and an array of activities that keep players enthralled. Its enduring popularity and ongoing relevance speak to its status as a benchmark for what a video game can achieve. GTA V is not just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon that continues to shape the landscape of interactive entertainment."
shits gas

"Rockstar deletes my tickets to request help after my account was compromised. It does not matter if you have a receipt on steam, they will do nothing to help. Really unsatisfied with the overall experience, even though the game itself was fun to play. I am one who believes once you buy a game you should have the right to play it, but unfortunately they do not share that sentiment. Do not buy unless you are willing to get scammed."
"Really enjoyed playing through story mode, good game if you're bored and want to commit mass genocide"
This game made me less violent.
"Story mode is great by default, Online is practically unplayable unless your in a private lobby due to modders and shit (as you've heard 83 times already). I would recommend this game tbh bc with friends online can still be fun."
"gtg fast, gotta make that money on my oppresor nerd"
"F**K Rockstar and their games. Steam ID useless now on their Games launcher. If you're still able to use it, awesome. If you can't, you are quite screwed my friends. Their customer support is absolutely entirely useless."
game where you shoot people and seal cars  the online kinda unless you use invite only server
good cars n drifting

"was a really good game but got goofy with flying bikes and cars, ray guns, lasers etc,, Childish now. Plus  way to many cheaters modders lost all its fun appeal"

"The Devs for this game are ridiculous. They make the online part of this game so grindy so if a mod comes and gives you a ridiculous amount of money or you use something to give yourself money so that you can actually make some money or use it to just have fun and buy vehicles they suspend your account. To all the Devs, get a life and let people have fun who aren't harming other players. Go suspend the accounts of people who are actual causing issues in online games like using GOD MODE or TP to people and killing them over and over or the people joining games and being invisible to kill you or having unlimited ammo and not needing to reload or explosive bullets. I have gotten into so many lobbies on PC and Xbox and have been messed with more of those people then someone giving money or modding to give money. Also how i know the Devs aren't doing squat about greifers is because i found two the other day and they have been doing this for months now. Anyways if you get the game to play online and have fun good luck they don't deal with toxic players and you'll sit here and grind till GTA6 comes out and still have nothing unless you by over priced shark cards to be able to make a little bit of money."
if this game had kids to kiddnap will be great

good game  to pass the next 2 years
"Although I bought and downloaded the game from steam, cannot connect to GTA V at all. Tried contacting the help & support, they did nothing. Now it doesn't work offline too: saying unknown game version. I am from Uzbekistan, if that is the issue, you guys are just racist pieces of sh* FYI I payed for the game but I am not satisfied at all."

"Title: A Decade-Long Journey through Los Santos: GTA V's Lasting Impact  Grand Theft Auto V, a virtual playground that has been a cornerstone of my gaming existence since I first stepped into the sun-soaked streets of Los Santos at the age of 12, continues to be a defining and integral part of my gaming life. As I reflect on an immersive 11-year journey, it's clear that GTA V isn't merely a game; it's a dynamic and enduring chapter in the story of my digital adventures.  Released in 2013, GTA V's Los Santos immediately captivated me with its breathtaking scale and attention to detail. The city was a living, breathing entity, teeming with diverse neighborhoods, iconic landmarks, and a vast, open landscape that begged to be explored. From the sunsets over Mount Chiliad to the vibrant lights of the Vinewood strip, each corner of the map became a familiar, yet endlessly captivating, part of my virtual world.  The narrative brilliance, which has become a trademark of the Grand Theft Auto series, found new heights in GTA V. The trio of protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor – brought unique perspectives to a sprawling tale of crime, camaraderie, and the pursuit of the American Dream. The heist missions, a standout feature, were not just adrenaline-pumping escapades but also strategic challenges that required meticulous planning and execution.  GTA V's success didn't stop at its single-player narrative; the introduction of Grand Theft Auto Online (GTAO) added an entirely new dimension to the experience. For the past six years, my friends and I have embarked on countless adventures in Los Santos, from coordinated heists to wild races and impromptu free-roam shenanigans. The ever-expanding world of GTA Online, with its regular updates and new content, has kept the virtual landscape fresh and dynamic.  The game's attention to detail extends beyond the narrative and into its satirical take on modern society. The radio stations, television shows, and in-game internet provided a sharp commentary on everything from politics to pop culture, enhancing the game's immersion and creating a world that felt eerily reflective of our own.  The gameplay mechanics, refined over the years, offered a perfect blend of action, exploration, and a sandbox for creativity. The character-switching feature, improved driving physics, and an extensive range of activities ensured that Los Santos never felt stale, even after countless hours of play.  While GTA V garnered widespread acclaim, it wasn't without its controversies and critiques, particularly in relation to the microtransaction model in GTA Online. Yet, these issues did little to diminish the overall impact of a game that has been a constant companion throughout my adolescence and early adulthood.  As I reminisce about the countless hours spent in Los Santos, the friendships forged in chaotic online sessions, and the enduring allure of the game's open world, it's clear that GTA V is more than just a form of entertainment. It's a nostalgic time capsule, a digital diary chronicling my growth as a gamer and the evolving landscape of the gaming industry over the past 11 years.  In the grand tapestry of my gaming life, GTA V stands tall as a masterpiece that transcends the medium. It's not just a game; it's a virtual home, a canvas for endless adventures, and a testament to the lasting impact that video games can have on the fabric of our lives."
Makes fun
fgood
nice game but still wait for GTA 6
GTA Online...  It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.
thank you for you rockstar is gta v game
I say go for it it's absolutely awesome
i love the story mode and graphics but online is just bad...you spend 100h of grind just to quit and delete this game and while grinding there are players trying to stop you for some reason or just som clickbait video for free money
The game is nostalgic and FUCKING iconic and forever will be no matter what
"Really good game, great to play with friends, however hackers can sometimes be an issue in the online mode but easily avoidable. A masterpiece of a game and truly a one of a kind."
The drift races are nice
Yep
good 👍👌
The Loading Screen is Fireee
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhH
Fun game runs well no crashes
its a classic fun game with friends
Best Game in the World
this game is so intrested
its goated
7 hours of running away from police and hitting people with an ax on the sidewalk alone is worth getting the game
SHESH
verry like
"Best Game. BOYZ, you can do everything what you always thought in your mind. In simple word if I say, it is completely your world. Just do whatever you want..."
WHY MY MONEY IS ALL LOST I DONT NOT DO ANY BUG WHYYYYYYY

best gta game i have ever played  i can do whatever i want  best graphics best story best characters best cars
best game to play with your buddies
One of The Best Games Made ever❤❤
great games even after 10 years of its release its still a great game to play
gegwawe
Average Game not worth it
"The year is 2023. Grand Theft Auto 5 has been released for over a decade. I load into Gta online. There's and error and I'm booted back to offline. I try again. There's an error and I'm booted. I try a third time, and thankfully it works. I get into a lobby and can't become a CEO because the maximum limit has been reached so I'm unable to start a business or do a cayo perico heist. I go outside in my favorite car. I'm killed by a random flying by on an oppressor. I call Mors mutual, get my car back. An orbital strike kills me. I call Mors mutual, a piloted missile from a sub kills me from a mile away. I call mors mutual, pissed off I am now looking to pvp. I pull up to someone and try shooting them. They're invincible. They launch my car into the stratosphere with cheats. I give up on freeplay. I try to load the Cayo Perico finale. I get stuck on the loading screen 4 times in a row and I end up unable to play the heist today. These fucking morons developing the game are focused on adding 1 more dogshit car to the game instead of making it playable on pc. I hope everyone who's ever touched the code of this game gets paralyzed from the neck down."
gooooooooddd
crimes

cool cars
"great and fantastic game. hope 6 lives up to the expectations. Single player is a lot of fun and enjoyable. lots of twists and gun fights. its worth it. online, however... can be hit or miss. lots of cheaters online but sometimes its playable. so invest in the single player and play online with friends or on your own.   havent tried it yet, but plan to mod the game and see how that goes."
freaking great!
Do you think gay people jerk off to themselves in the mirror?
I'm a degen irl
UWU i love this game so much i love shooting people in the shoestore
best game ever...after GTA IV of course
Good single player campaign. Online mode is unplayable on PC because of all the cheaters. Rockstar is not worried about the online experience anymore however they want you to spend money. They want your money and they dont care.. Jip. about sums it up.
95+
I was a fan of this game before I bought it but now I'm a whole helicopter
"PC version still doesn't have the graphical update that consoles had for over a year now, and with the recent update, now doesn't have ANIMALS [without mentioning third-party software modifications] where console does. Don't waste your time or money, PC version is an afterthought to Rockstar. This is without me going into the new player experience to Grand Theft Auto Online where you're already severely handicapped by not having properties to launch most of the content that is currently out like Cayo Perico or base heists like Pacific Standard unless you find a group of friends who already have said resources or pay money to get ingame cash to buy said properties.  SP is fun, though, I will say, but also suffers from a lack of attention, where Online has several more vehicles and weapons that the base game doesn't, with no way to be able to use them without third party tools. Honestly just wait for GTAVI at this point, God knows whenever that will be for PC."
very ice game
It Is great game
:-3
Perfect!  even it's 2023
"Has been a great game for years, I enjoy playing through the story mode every few years."

its gta....you like it you hate it...you play it or not.
I like the game. but the problem is that the online game. Sometimes it will disconnect by itself. need to repair that.
not a bad game
"""How to describe the heavy snow""My teacher said so.  That was eight or nine years ago.I was still in primary school at that time.The first thing I do after school every day is to turn on the computer and watch the program.By chance, I met GTA5.He really gave me a great shock in my childhood, and then I realized that the original game could do this.Since then, I have been tirelessly watching related videos every day to see how the anchors are all-powerful in Los Angeles.Then I reluctantly turned off the TV when my parents urged me to eat.It was a wonderful time.It formed my whole childhood concept of games.Until this year, I finally played this game and walked on the streets of Los Angeles. Everything was familiar and vivid.I have traveled to this hometown through video countless times.I finished the offline story again, no, I don't know how many times I relived their story, but this time I witnessed it myself.After many years, it still gave me a shock, about the stories of the protagonists, about my second hometown, Los Angeles.Driving in the street car in Los Angeles, playing Sleeping Walk.My childhood has drifted away, but it won't, forever the capital of Los Angeles, a generation of classics.After many years, I remember when the teacher asked me how to describe the heavy snow, and now I have the answer. ""Nine years ago, North Yangkton, ludendorff"""
sheeeeeesh
illegal shit yes good fun and hitting innocent pedestrians is fun too
online sucks ass
This is one of the best game that I have ever played in my entire gaming period. Its perfect in every aspects
i like to fuck the prostitutes then shoot them then do burnouts on their dead body on a rusty 1950's car a stole from a white person that sounds like a black person
Great game! Love the tatas and bootys!
best game specially gta online

rram ram ram ram ram
i hate rockstar launcher <333333 i love not being able to play without useless social club <33333
"Simply the best game in the entire series, and holds up nearly a decade after its release. I have no idea why I never got around to playing this sooner, but I'm glad I finally did. Every main character is likable and hilarious in their own way; even the d@mn dog, Chop, had me at hello.  Don't worry about how messy the online experience is. This is not a game you should be playing for the PVP. This very busy slice of San Andreas is more than detailed and vivid enough to keep you busy for a very long time. I've never met a GTA game that wasn't worth booting up just to go for a cruise and get absolutely nothing done and still feel like a satisfying time was had. Five does this best - I daresay better than my previous favorite entry in the franchise, Vice City. There is plenty to keep you busy until 6 comes out in a few years - and no doubt, that announcement is gonna drive a lot of people, even a whole new generation of  gamers, back here to 5 while they wait with baited breath. At the prices it usually goes on sale for - $10-15 - it's still money well spent. There's no better way to get your fix until the next installment hits.  There's a lot of wasted time still in my future with this game, I have foreseen it."
I CAN CALL BLACK PEOPLE NIG
yo this game is crazy good
GYAT
fun like cum
"I would like to be NPC to hire...for online mission. Sometimes other players spoil everything...Another thing..,special vehicle ammu shouldn't be infinite. From 1 to 10, this game is an 9!"

AMBATUKAAAAAAM
good gamw
"Its been out for a while obviously, but its fun!"
"Rockstar makes you jump through a thousand hoops to even play offline.  put about 20 hours into the game and now it gets halfway through staring up and playing the short intro video and just shuts down.  Also, wtf is up with the driving physics and vehicle body damage? when did gta become an arcarde game?"
great game but the story isnt the best but im fine with
please add more dogs to slaughter.
"Well, it's been more than 10 years."
"Story is okay, though I preferred GTA IV's storyline more, I thought that was much more interesting... Online on the otherhand? If you don't got friends don't even bother bro- oh AND get this game on sale, bye bye."
"good game, way too much cussing and saying ""nigga"", but lots to do."
Hehehehehe Shoot gunz

i would recommend this game on pc its better
is goood gameeee
"As a long time player of GTA Online i am very disappointed by the new update how features I would be excited for are being held from the PC version for seemingly no reason other than ""they aren't the new consoles so they aren't next gen"". Without cheaters GTA Onine is a very enjoyable update, but being neglected by Rockstar for years now I cannot recommend it for any PC gamers out there and it makes me more worried about the future of the GTA series on PC."
GTA rp on top
very good very good sí sí bueno
everything I NEED GTA6 RIGHT NOW THOOOOOO
soooooo gooooood.
Updated made this game un-launchable. Nice try rockstar. you are not a real game dev. company. DELETE

ITS GTAV... What do you expect
its gta what do u expect
h00kers
steal car make money
Story line is very well done and I have playing all of the GTA's and this one is the best of all
"Very fun story, the online is also a fun distraction"
I can't launch the game don't know why. Rockstar Games Launcher is a disaster.
"I personally like Gta but there are a few things that need to be wary of, firstly gta6 is on the horizon so any new players (if there are any) should do some research before buying, pc isnt the greatest choice if you have a ps5 or series x id recommend buying on there. pc is riddled with modders like ps3 and xbox 360. there are a few good pc players, honest pc players but pc has been left behind by rockstar so having to worry about modders will more of a annoyance if you enjoy pvp in free mode. like i said i enjoy gta i hide in invite only sessions anyway. gta will always have a special place in my heart and not all modders are bad but doing a race with 3 laps and 45 checkpoints someone completes it 1-10 seconds is honestly annoying theres no point in trying to compete with that but my opinion is my own gta is 5/5 for me :)"
online is the best
yas salt
hyb vb
puuuurrrty fun
shit i would never play this game. dont recommend it at all hardly even played this trash
GTA FOR LIFE
"This is by far my most played gta game, having over 300+ hrs. I most payed for the game just to have a little fun once again and to write this review. The story sure is not as good as the other gta games, but just being so big and having so much to do stands out, for the last 10 years (because frankly is the last gta release for so long) is worth to be played. I hope the next gta installment will be more ambitious and bigger than this one, offering more gta-content for the fans."
This game has the most boring story R* ever produced.
vroom vroom pedestrian insides everywhere
what can i say it's an absolute classic. 100million people can not be wrong.
One of the best game I have played for years. Never get boring and I can highly recommend everyone to test it out
Peak story and amazing mechanics. Would definitely recommend
Gets boring after a while don't waste your money.
GYAAATTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!
one of the top games of all time

"Dope game. Tom Brady, Lebron James run."

Within an hour I got told how bad my hair cut was had a gun to my head and ran a car through a window.... W game.
"Great storyline, and the best open world game. A bit of chaos online lobbys"
"Steal, kill, run over things, escape the police, make money.  Fly planes / helicopters......really, do almost anything you want too, WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE!"

The game isn't a complete version.
"The new dlc is updated like a piece of dirty shit,Rockstar's update is getting worse and worse."
makes me wanna kms
Its GTA so like always awesome
i wish strip club had jiggle physics
its lowkey good but it gets a bit boring ...says the one with 80 hours but ye solid game worth 30 pounds !
"I don't like that other players who can hack your game and kill you wish it was more peaceful, Although i found out theres a private server, just wish to be around other players just without the drama!  I enjoyed everything else, would like more clothing shops tho!"
SSUREE
its very good relieves my stress
this is a big gaame!
"Online is pretty terrible :( Ruined by modders because Rockstar cant seem to figure out how anti-cheat works.  Bugs, glitches and long loading times on some occasions. Some content is fairly repetitive and not very enjoyable. Half the cars have been taken away and resold exclusively to console players after purchasing the game. GTA+ is a scam. The game is poorly optimized and will run at low fps while GPU usage stays low.  Inflation on nearly everything which means you have to replay the same boring heist a hundred times to actually afford anything decent. Overall the game has become the parody in which it once used to make fun of which is quite sad when you think about it. A shame as the game has alot of potential. If they fail so much and cant get the online in GTA 5 to work properly then I dont have much excitement for GTA 6. There are much better developed games out there that id rather spend my time playing. Sorry Rockstar but Online is a mess. The players deserve a refund. Absolute Garbage."

its awesome
It is very fun to play and there are tons of mods to expand on the game

LOVELY BUT STORY MODES ARE SHORT
Story mode is great and online is great with friends but it's a daaaaaaaangerous thing.
Awesome game.
i cant set my control keys on keyboard its so terrifying for me
best of the best even after being a decade old
They sh!t up the online with their dlc powercreep but it's actually a good game
"Honestly I love this game. I have played it on many accounts in the past. The reason I wouldn't recommend this game to other people is because GTA Online is overrun by people with virtual powers to freeze your game. So lets say you see an easy kill inside a store or you want to run over a group of people fighting, it really doesnt matter the scenario - you can bet one out of the many players, who may or may not be there, has a tool on his machine which can log your IP (which honestly doesnt do anything - especially with a VPN), and they can do things like freeze your character, spawn hundreds of vehicles on top of you, and even edit your stats and money in-game. The bottom line is this: people in GTA Online are emotionally challenged. They get angry too easily and when you anger the wrong person they unleash glitches from the nether onto your GTA character faster than you can blink. This will disrupt your gameplay and might even frustrate the sh*taki out of you, but if you show them they got to you then they've won. So I do not recommend this game for anyone who is an emotional basketcase. Rockstar and Steam really ought to start making gamers take psychological tests before selling them games like this. The entire GTA Online community is toxic when it comes to in-game mechanics and dealing with getting your character hurt. I mean that is the point of the game, but they take it so seriously that they react like you've just taken a leak in their cheerios."
Probably the best game ever made
"I've played GTA my whole life. Grew up with this series, highly recommend!"

"Rockstar is punishing everyone who owns a PC by yet again not releasing GTA6 on PC at launch. They use us as cash cows while console players always get everything they want. I'm tired of being a second class gamer.  GTA5 is still a masterpiece, but it shouldn't of took 2 years for this game to come to PC either."
its a great game and good game to mod
Ahh yeahh
modders have ruined all online play
Favourite game of all time but the only thing is little bit lag or shuttering while drive vehicle please solve this rockstar

"There is no word to describe the game. In short, the game is very beautiful while playing, immerse yourself and immerse yourself while playing. Two or three hours pass and you don't feel anything terrible at the time. I'm excited for the next part of GTA VI."

why i can't play on my steam deck?!
"Just downloaded GTA 5, I got 2 years to enjoy this masterpiece, less go..."
my first wank
love this game especially when playing grand rp
completely aids but if aids was fun
"I wanted to hit recommend because both single-player and online have some great moments and I do think it's worth playing (maybe on sale though), BUT (and this is a BIG but) there are just WAY too many cheaters with mod-menus that grief you and are invincible. Like I get that Online is SUPER grindy to get to the good stuff, and I totally understand people using these cheat menus to give themselves ranks and or cash (Who actually buys Shark Cards? lol), but there is absolutely no reason to take out a low rank level 10 doing a job when you are an invincible rank level 420+ cheating with a mod menu. Too many hacking griefers in this game that Rockstar doesn't ban. So I just can't recommend currently.  It's good. (When it isn't grindy and you aren't being griefed by modmenu cheaters)"
The only open world game where i get more than 100 fps
"if you like driving around and murdering innocent people, or your one of the 5 people who didnt play the story, this game is for you.. otherwise online is just shit. used to be fun now its more chaotic and headachey than gmod sand box.. everyone hacks, constantly prompting you to play the little side missions and takes forever to make any money.. just do what everyone else does and hack a lil bit.. at this point in the game youll never be on anyone elses level and just spending 30 min doing the same shit over and over and over again sucks.. fun game still if you wanna waste countless hours.. but i think there are better options.."
BEST PC GAME I EVER PLAYED
I just bought the game with Criminal Chase starter pack but it's not working. Can someone please help me? thank you
I thought the shoe logo was for a shoe store.......................................otherwise its a good game yeah
ofcourse i had to revisit now that the VI trailer dropped.
best GAME till 2023
"Play it after 10 years relase it. Waiting until I have a proper PC to run it, totally worth it"
james randall edged me
3 more Years!! VI!!
PIJE JUEGO
Still worth it in 2024
n g g
It's GTA man. Just get it. (Preferably on sale)
VI is comingg
"tbh idk why i keep playing this. its not bad, but online leaves me feeling hollow when im not getting into admittedly thrilling car chases and fights with friends. of course its a good game, and the singleplayer story experience is amazing so pick it up if you havent already"
"if you know you know, all time hands down one of the best video game in history in the GTA series"
good game so far
Heists are fun with friends
"This game has been around for almost a decade. It gets a lot of love that is well deserved and its even better on PC then it was on console when I originally played it at launch. I don't think I need to elaborate on the story or the game mechanics, it is your typical GTA style open world sandbox affair and no one in the business does it better then Rockstar Games. It'll be interesting to see if their next release is as interesting seeing as this style of game has started to feel stale, at least that's how I felt about RDR2. I know that people loved that title, however, it was a little bit drawn out for my tastes. I will be replaying that one too just to give it another shake a few years later. I can't say that this is a bad game, and tbh, it is my second fav in the franchise behind Vice City."
"i always wanted to play this game since first release 10 years ago, and here i'm finally can play it now  the wait was worth it because the game is amazing even though it's been 10 years"
"lots of guns, pew pew"
lots of boogers in this game. i like boogers.
Lot of fun there is ton to do. Build yourself an Empire. there is something always on discount and double money and RP.
mlep blep
fun very interactive

ncie game
GTA VI will be the greatest video game ever created.

THE GREATEST
ILove RockStar Games
"Amazing game, I enjoy Griefing Trash grinders and making them rage quit when they spend multiple hours of their life grinding cargo just for me to blow it up in under a minute with my Jet, I also enjoy blowing up random low levels with various hated weapons and vehicles. if you are a soy boy this game isn't for you. this game is for PvP not Grinding cargo 24/7 like these trash no life grinders. And remember lads Subscribe to Pewdiepie ;]"
"played this game on Xbox 360, Xbox one, and now PC. this is definitely my most played game of all time."
very good where gta6 tho????????????
"I have played this for 828 hours, and I got this copy only five years ago. Release GTA6 already Rockstar... 828 hours... that is a 34.5 days... so release GTA6 already, release another one in 2025 and 2027 lol"
The new launcher says they will send any information you give them to countries that will NOT protect it. DON'T TRUST GAME ANYMORE!!! DON'T TRUST THIS PUBLISHER ANYMORE!!!
"good game, v swag."
"*It takes at least a few hours for your Criminal Enterprise DLC for it to credit to your account. You have to add the stuff individually. There are a lot resources out there on how to do it. It's easy.   I've played this before, but sold that console long ago and just recently go the itch. It's good stuff, one of the better open world games made, and the best GTA IMO. Online has its ups and downs but it's pretty solid fun. Overall I'd say grab it."
Thy American Dream
GOOD stuff
I've been playing this game since the GTA Playstation One and PC. It is a great time waster.
One of the greatest games of all time...  ...but it cannot be played on my Steam Deck without an internet connection because of Rockstar's shoddy DRM.
Very bigoli and champson!
"the gaming its self is on another level, no need to comment actually. nothing to complain about"
story mode is amazing and online is a grind and can be really aggravating but its goat
"Great game, cant wait for GTA VI"

Rockstar launcher blows
"WHO WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS AMAZING GAME, STILL ONE OF THE GREATEST A DECADE LATER!"

"Story mode is a must, online is a big no no unless you wanna mod. Also modding the game is a pain in the ass, don't do it if your new to modding. mod menus are another story tho, literally plug and play."

"7/10, brought it off steam, got the full game and premium edition for grand theft auto online (criminal enterprise) story is good, online is okay but after 4.7 hours playtime i have yet to receive my criminal enterprise bonus, it was on discount for the whole game, online and criminal enterprise pack but i haven't received my criminal enterprise bonus after more then 4.7 hours of game play, so if anyone knows why i haven't gotten my bonus please let me know."
its a fun game especially if you wanna get blown up while you try to do any online mission
is this gta 6?
Does not get boring.
"Yes, I played it. Very Cool"
Incredibly awesome
go do fake felonies to decline real felonies... save the world

10-10
ONE OF THE BEST GAMES
Felt I was kinda harsh and hit the wrong message in my previous review. So I will make it smaller:  GTA V Storymode is Amazing GTA Online is only good with private sessions with friends.
Honestly Hate the modders but story mode is top tier and online mode. Best game wanted to play since I was 9
Its GTA ofc its fun
I can play with my husband and he doesnt get mad...at all...not a single bit...especially when I crash us in the final mission stages :)
16 jours of attempting to launch the game and 0 hours of playitme
"amazing. so much content, hilarious, graphics are not bad for a fairly old game. highly reccomend."
It is amazing
finnally i downloaded gta v in my pc and it's a great experience. I hope those who want to play gta v but doesn't have any gaming pc don't worry guys one day you will also play this game.My name is sayan and my youtube is formax gamer ff

"This game has a really mean and cruel community the game is not what is was. All I get is killed and then bitched at when I go for payback . Almost every session is hacked to hell. Rockstar is starting to go south RDR 2 online  ,ect. this is only my opinion. I feel dejected every time I think I can play a decent session in GTA V"
very good high quality

"Today, I want to introduce you to a highly anticipated game, Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). The game is an action-adventure game developed by Rockstar Games and first released in 2013.  First, let's talk about the graphics of the game. Grand Theft Auto V uses advanced graphics technology to make the scenes and characters in the game very realistic. Whether it is the architecture of the city, the natural scenery or the facial expressions of the characters, every detail is carefully designed to make people feel like they are in it. At the same time, the animation effects of the game are very smooth, making people feel like watching a Hollywood blockbuster.  Next, let's talk about the plot of the game. Grand Theft Auto V takes place in the fictional city of Los Angeles and allows players to take on the roles of three different characters: Mike, Trevor and Franklin. Each of these three characters has its own story arc, and players need to complete missions to advance the story. The whole story is tight, gripping and irresistible.  Finally, let's talk about how the game is played. Grand Theft Auto V is an action adventure game in which players are required to drive, shoot, sneak and more. At the same time, there are a variety of tasks for the player to complete, these tasks not only test the player's operating skills, but also make the game more interesting.  Overall, Grand Theft Auto V is a very good game. Its beautiful picture, compact plot, diverse gameplay, people can not extricate themselves. If you love action adventure games, then this game must not be missed!"

"Don't give rockstar any money, they don't care about the game, its just new events to get you to buy more shark cards. cheaters and modders who godmode, speed hack, crash your game and just cause all kinds of other issuses makes it a horrible time and rockstar doesn't care at all. if you want to enjoy gta go buy a consol and play it there, no modders there. 0/10 wouldn't buy again"

"""Who’s joe?"" a distant voice asks.  Instantly everyone nearby hears the sound of 1,000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his location.  The earth itself seemed to cry out in agony, until finally the ground itself split open and a horrific creature crawled from the ground, covered in mucus and tar.  ”Joe Momma…” the creature whispered.  The man cried out in pain as he disintegrated into dust, and the whole world fell silent in fear.  ""I did a little trolling."" the wretched creature remarked before burrowing back into the earth."

"Rockstars insistence on updating the game EVERY time I went to play it, nagged me to the point where I simply uninstalled it. I come to play the games to get AWAY from nagging, not have to endure more of it FFS. Also having to sign up for the rockstar launcher simply to play the game that I've payed for, was a big turn off. I have no interest in the online gaming stuff. Anything by rockstar from now on, I'll simply avoid like the plague."

Best game. Until GTA 6 comes out...
"I've played this game on PS3, PS4, and PC. Spending roughly 100hrs on each play-through.  If in Oct 2013 you'd told me this game would become one of the most bankable ever due to an Online component that launched BROKEN I wouldn't have believe you.  Here we are 10 years later, watching the trailer for GTAVI. Can't wait!"

Good game yes
Really Awesome Game I now wait GTA 6 Fun Is ONNNNN>>>>>>>>>>>>
"Pretty good, but San Andreas is better. What I struggle with is how the map was introduced: fuckton of space right away. Would have been better, if it was slowly introduced. I still have no idea where I am, when I'm cruising around .. Or maybe it's because the graphics are so good? Maybe it's just me.  I'm here only for the story mode, so ofc, I'd wish there was more of it. The characters are great, I enjoy how different they all are."
nice and sexy
klk
VERY GOOD. HIGHLY RECCOMEND
Take Adavantage of any sale this has. Its filled with modders that WASTED thier lives modding. And they can close your game anytime LOL might as well wait 2 more years for GTA 6  <3
STOP UR CAR ASShold
opinthechat
This type of games don't need any review.
The game has great dialogues and awesome voice acting especially Micheal's. Will surely miss the game GTA 6 here we go...
"I must admit that I had high hopes for Grand Theft Auto 5, but my experience left me incredibly disappointed. While the game offers an open-world environment with plenty of opportunities for chaos and mayhem, it falls far short in terms of diversity and inclusion, and this issue significantly tarnished my overall enjoyment.  The primary problem I encountered was with the game's three main characters: Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. It's 2023, and the gaming industry should be moving towards better representation and inclusivity. Unfortunately, GTA 5 missed the mark entirely."

An all time classic and maybe the greatest game ever made.

"Literally only bought this cause it was on sale for $10 lol, I've already got over 400 hours on the Rockstar Games launcher."
gets me hard
It is good
YES YES
nice gamw
"The cars in this game are really well made and nice to look at. When in the online mode you can customise a character almost fully and also steal/buy a car to keep. One problem I have is when in the online mode, players with high wealth and good weapons grief on others."
fire! can't wait for the next instalment.
michael got high and shot aliens  10/10 would get molested by aliens again

Rockstar account required just to play OFFLINE.   Unable to play the game because the Rockstar launcher won't send verification emails. Unable to play the game because the Rockstar launcher won't allow me to play when I make a new account because I made before in the past for RDR2.  Unable to complete password reset because the Rockstar launcher won't stop asking me to complete over 16 captcha puzzles that always fails at the end.   Literal dumpster fire.
i dont say stuff only recomend
"GTA V is one of the best open world games of all time, enough said."

"Rockstar Games Launcher, possibly due to slow game launch times.If possible like a console would be better."
I Should Say Online Is TOOO much fun :>
good vibes
i'm finally free from epic games launcher exclusivity
"Why do i need an social club account to play this game? and when i try logging in, it keeps saying that I am using the incorrect password and each time I reset it it tells me that I have the wrong password. Very stupid problem that I wouldnt have if they didnt require an account for me to play."
i like that there are a lot of stuff you can do in gta and the controls are cool a wells
I mean this game is good but rockstar games has got to fix the hacking issue
One of the greatest games of all time
"this game has so much swearing in it, no manners whatsoever."
LIT

"Accidentally removed my licences, tried to buy again, wouldnt let me"

KICKS U OUT
"After a decade of this game being out and bringing so much joy, and great memories to our GTA5 community.  As 1 out of millions that played this game, till this day i will recommend this game to everyone and anyone because this game is not only just our childhood memories and moments but one of the worlds greatest games to ever hit The gaming community in history. Every update was a blast and its sad to now have to let go of all our great times. With GTA6 coming out we're more excited then ever and just cant wait for all the great graphics, and great new memories."
i like drive
Want to fuck around? This is your sandbox.
i could not log in this game  so i tried to refund this game but then it didn't give my money back for almost a month now im gonna get the game back
GTA 6!!!
I drive
Woth it enjoyable you won't regret it even if you are alone as long as you understand the nature of the game
this game is very cool and you to go down any path in life
Ansioso pelo VI
"Never stopped being good, Rockstar is one of the few AAA developers I will still support."
I love running over civilians. The game is good too 10/10
i went to the shoe store. best choice of my life
"This is a part of gaming history. Not always perfect, but everyone needs to have played it"
"Not a big fan of the criminal aspects of the game, but the open world part is fun."
i like hearing the civillians scream.
controls jank
Fun game but as of late 2023 the launcher still won't let me log in so I can't play it.
"There is a lot of glitches, but GTA 5 online can be fun."
I Will Eat 1 Spoon of Mayonnaise For Every Award this review gets until GTA 6 is released
Viciante
It is GTA V. You should always be playing this game.
I beat up a HOOKER AND TOOK MY MONEY BACK.
10/10 game.  Great graphics.  Can't wait for GTA 6 in like 1-2 years.
fun idk driving cool
cuh
"Unbelievable how a multi million company can be too limited to either properly program or remove their stupid forced launcher when they think they can make a Steam release. You buy a title from rockstar on steam again so that you can escape this moronic senseless plague called rockstar social garbage and then after a 100GB download you get nothing but crazy error messages, login prompts and when you have made it into the game you are asked for some activation to register the game you bought on steam with rockstar."
"PEW PEW, COpS SHOOT, BIG CAR STEEAL! Good game."
GTA VI inbound.  Never finished the story before but Rockstar never disappoints.  Online is crazy if you have the cohones
this game....... is like a trip back to a time where things were simpler. the blacks were more gangster the whites were more racist and incels were burnt at the stake
Gambling is fun
free r kelly
hmmmm i love oiled up men they really tickel my fancy  1 feedback make men strippers a thing plese
GAMBLE IN THE CASINO FOR HOURS
Just got gta on my pc for the first time! i love it!! its aot better then my old xbox and ps4 and ps5
great with friends when u online but story mode is awesome ..right now im modding the game for single player having fun with that(slap face)
"The game itself is a masterpiece, however I am extremely annoyed by how Rockstar is treating their customers. Since months I'm not able to access my account (I'm not even playing online so I'm not banned or anything), I've made multiple support requests and support simply doesn't respond. I doubt I will ever buy a rockstar game again, regardless of how great that game might be....  Here are two ""thumbs"" up for you Rockstar! ……..…../´¯/)…..……… (\¯`\ …………/….//……….. …\\….\ ………../….//………… ….\\….\ …../´¯/…./´¯\……....…../¯ `\….\¯`\ .././…/…./…./.|_……_| .\….\….\…\.\..

"Single player is absolutely worth the price...when it is on sale. I've purchased this game on PS3, PS4, and PC...twice now. Definitely wait for a sale to get ready for GTA VI in 2025!  Online is not even worth a look. Don't bother. I'll never forgive online killing the chances of getting our single player DLC..."

GTA 5 story game awesome but online is Fortnite mayhem party

Game is fun as hell. Not recommended / downvoted because of bullshit Rockstar launcher. Add'l launcher (aside from Steam) = not-recommended. Will do until devs stop pushing extra launchers. This is the hill I will die on.

"Overall both the story and online mode are great, but online is only good if you're patient enough to go through 5 minutes of loading screen for every mission/job you join."

"This game is better than any open world game, its fun, it would be more fun if i have a better laptop lol"
nice and fun game
if u wanan go around shooting and drug dealing and car fast things then get this
Greatest game ever made.
i got fucking scammed
good game please gta 6 come soon
"Fun, exiting, very good graphics for coming out in 2013 10/10"
Best game and company
don't go to the shoe store
"Story mode is good. So many bugs and waiting times in GTA Online sometimes having to restart the game over it, the modders are the worst. They are everywhere. Can't find a lobby without godmode aimbot players blowing up others. It's as if external paid mods are aloud and part of the game now. They are working on GTA6 yes but with tens/hundreds thousands still playing GTA Online they should have a team fix at least the immense amount of modders/cheaters present. It's almost unplayable with the modders/cheaters but you get by. Good game overall"
sdfghjk
it's a real god
"Fun game, hackers can be annoying"
elon musk hates this game
GAME INI SANGAT SUSAH
great! But rockstar don't care about banning the hackers in online.
Rockstar broke GTA5 working at all on Linux thanks to the god awful DRM-launcher which refuses to work.
Did dont let you play the Singelplayer on offline mode on steam. And my fun is gone.
super wholesome and something the whole family can enjoy
"Just launch the fucking game i paid for, not force me to log into some 3rd party bullshit."
very nice game. good graphics and story. can't wait to try online.
Strong summer vibe.

"fuck your clunky camera angles, repetitive missions, idiotically inconsistent vehicle controls, and the dialogues sounded like it was written by a 10 year old. Fuck you rockstar."
Seriously? you are looking at reviews for GTA V?  Just go for it because it is the best game ever made!!
Good Job
Cons: Rockstar Launcher/Social Club Account  Pros: Frees up over 100gbs of space when uninstalled.
"TLDR; GTA Online does not feel like GTA and is Pay2Win.  You can buy with real money weapons and super-charged weaponized vehicles. This allows you to dominate all other players. Regular players will never have those if they don't make this game their full-time job for extended period of time.  The super charged weapons and vehicles make this game have zero GTA vibe. I'm trying to blast someone with a shotgun, but they perish me with some alien looking, alien sounding weapon that I do not even know what it is. Laser weapons? What about learn how to make a consistent game experience.  Also, game experiences so many issues when trying to play with friends, I will join a session, but not be with them in a session, or I would get kicked for no reason, etc...  I am not even gonna mention anything about cheaters/modders as it doesn't matter. What's the difference between a cheater one-shoot killing me and a kid who poured ton of money into the game and can chase me around a map in a flying motorbike that's capable of shooting rookets?   GTA? No. This game does not feel like a GTA."
It is very detailed and is very fun with so many fun and interesting things to do I love it and you will too!
"very good game, but ofc the gta online loading is trash as always"
Unbelievably great graphics and open world to enjoy. Worth it in discount prices
best game ever.
rlly goof
Graphics are super cool.
fun with mods game it feels like a different game

It's a bit late to comment on a game that is 10 years old... 10 years of pure online fun!
"Great game, lots of content"
bbc
"10/10  - Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece. The game is packed with content, the story is incredibly engaging, and the open world is simply stunning. I recommend!"
GTA VII IN 3025 WHAT A JOKE
"If you haven't played it, what are you doin?"
very fun but not fun if there are modders in the lobby
ujyu
mid ass game
time consuming open world pretty fun
GTA VI IN 2025 WHAT A JOKE
very nice and sexy
I like that mods. I Love that mods cars
mantap mbut
gta 6 gonna be fire
"Is good, nuff said!"
10/10 cant wait for the sixth entry
"i dont have a problem with story mode, but after u 100% (story mode), it would only make sense to play online. worst mistake of my life. gta v online is litearly filled with assets that have been copied from story mode to online (maybe changed a little bit) not to mention the cheater problem in this game. almost everyone is running with god mode and griefing the entire server. you would be lucky if a cheater didnt post your ip in the chat just because you said something like ""stop cheating"" not only that, rockstar doesnt give a fuck about cheaters ruining the game. the only problem they have is when you cheat to get money. because why buy sharkcards for real life cash when u can just cheat to get money for free? what im saying is rockstar doesnt give a fuck about players. they only want money"
This is my first time playing GTAV. This game is enjoyable.
I Love the Game because of the Shooting.
Well it is a really entertaining high detail must play Game
STILLL BEST GAMEEE
its better than console because of mods and text chat in game and its way esier to play
best game known to man
modo historia legal n jogue o online é uma porcaria
kere
it is sooo much fun to play gta5 ican't wait till gta6
you get to commit any crime you want... any.
The story is great the online is shite
Recommended!
very very nice
This is the only game that got me scared if my parent walk in
very fun game you should buy it yourself and see firsthand
good for kids under 10 you can learn a lottt
When rockstar deletes your social club account and they cannot reimburse you with a functioning CD key. Don't bother wasting your time with rockstar support.
social club problem
MANRABB
Go to the strip club see boobies shoot everyone inside it I love this game. 10/10

thanks for the memories and with friends great experience
I having an issue while entering activation code it showing that Rockstar activation code is already used please can someone help me to fix it please somebody help 😭😭

> GTA VI
"FIX YOUR LOGIN R*, THE VERIFICATION IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND TEDIOUS, I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME, NOT SPENDING HOURS TO PROVE I'M A HUMAN."
best game ever created i started playing gta as a kid love rockstar and everyhting they do thanks rockstar games and everyone involved in creating this masterpiece.
hacker is a huge problem
Good for increasing mental stress
"high graphics, awesome gameplay"
Excellent game!! Just few bugs in gta online occurs sometime otherwise worth for buying
Relived my childhood for the 13 hours I've been playing
gooo
"For a 10+ year old game it still manages to impress me. Been playing it (off and on) since it first dropped on PS3 and even now, on PC in the end of 2023, this is still an amazing game. Even with GTA6 on the horizon (at long last) I'd still recommend picking this game up (if somehow you've managed not too) and giving it a go. Sure it has aged quite abit now, there are prettier games out there for sure, but the detail R* put in this game is unreal and the expansive open world is still alot of fun to explore. Online is playable solo if you really not interested in playing with randoms (or don't have friends who play) but is best experienced with others if possible."
11/10
n i c e !
This is very fabulous game I ever played. you guys are very enjoyed when you are playing this game.
not fun unless you have a mod menu

"Note to myself to stop playing Rockstar games.  I was trying to finish RDR2 recently and I never felt so dumb during that time.  Yes, it is rather beautiful game with nice acting and ugly looking characters, but the worst problem is like when there is a mission there can be shooting and massacre all around and no one cares but on the instant when mission ends, dare to loot a remaining character because dreaded ""15 second attention bubble code"" is instantly spawning a witness on a horse or riding a cart to report Your crime to the authorities.  When You are hunting there will be no animals for hours, but as soon as You are riding a horse they will be spawning because they are acting as a ""decoration"".  These kind of games are like the yarn string that we, people use to entertain the cat - they put something stupid in our sight and we run to catch a that red string.  But is this really what we want and need?  Well may be some, but I do not.  I want to heave meaningful experiences in the open world game where I can feel as a creator myself instead of a dumb idiot chasing random number generator creating spawns to find and catch a three star animal for a crafting blueprint that will add +5 stats on my inventory capacity or something like that.  It's dumb, it's nonsense.  I can't put this review on RDR2 on steam since I bought it on Microsoft Store I believe so I put it here since, according to my own memories - GTAV was pretty much the same kind of design:  Much of the world is persistent only as long as it is within Your cone of view. Like if You watch a traffic in the industrial complex You will see a lot of heavy trailers driving and they stay on road if You follow them further outside that industrial complex, but the very next moment, when You pan Your view to something else, outside their ""spawn area"", they are lost - ""despawned"".  Think of it as if You were trying to play a chess but You are limited to see only the half of the chess board and every time You move Your sight, the chess pieces reappear randomly, to create an illusion of playing a chess game: that is what it means to play these kind of games."
"the only game i need, this is perfect"
very nice but the missions and npc are too OP its like forcing you to buy game shark cards just to get money
amazing'
I did a crime
highly recommended
It's a very god game.(I'm waiting for Grand Theft Auto/Gta 6)
rpg go boom boom
A lawful game for fellow citisens
"GTA 6 is comin', Baby! 💯"

Greatest GTA game ever.
"Grand Theft Auto V stands out as a gaming masterpiece with its compelling narrative, rich character development, and a meticulously crafted open world that seamlessly blends action, humor, and exploration. The game's stunning visuals, diverse missions, and multiplayer options further elevate it as a must-play title, delivering an unforgettable gaming experience."
Very gud game
i have play everyone of the gta and this the best one yet
The game is very good
Best game to play
"FULL OF CHEATER MOD SCUM OF ALL SORT, WHO WILL GO OUT OF WAY TO MAKE YOUR EXPERIENCE MISERABLE, GET YOU STUCK OR KILL YOU OR EVEN KICK YOU FROM GAME/SERVER IN THE MIDDLE OF MISSION, MOST MODDERS ARE DISGUSTING SCUM FILTH WHO JUST WANT TO DO YOU BAD FOR 10 YEARS ROCKSTAR HASN'T ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE SO THE GAME DIED,  WE ARE ALL WAITING FOR 6 BUT BASED ON THIS NO EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL BE ANY DIFFERENT, SAD, ANGERING AND DISSAPOINTING"
Amazing game.
"It's a great game, and has aged very well considering how long it's been up. Good updates, looking forward to GTA 6."
Pineapples are Fun!!!
I mean its GTA what more to say IDk
"I won't say anything new that wasn't said millions times before. GTA V is a must own and play for almost anyone who enjoys perfect games. You have like literally and open world in which you can do anything, and everything is done so good, so great. I beat this game on PS4, and to be honest the control at the beginning felt awkward, but its just like for 5,6 hours - then you will get use to them and it will be just awesome. And there couple more minuses (story mode) - i didn't find any purpose for your crews skill levels - there aren't many heists in the story itself (or maybe i missed something). And other thing is sometimes very frustrating controls of the characters when you there is action is some very closed space, thankfully there weren't many of those. And the last thing is a targeting system when you are in a car flying on some 120 km/h - good luck in to shooting some specific targets.  That said, GTA 5 is almost perfect. The story narrative, screenplay, acting, voice acting, directing and whole craftsmanship is the best there can be. And i even just started to scratch the surface of GTA Online. Overall - one of the very best ever."
One of the best game ever.
"Fantastic, Game Ever i am excited for GTA 6"
"Mas malo que pegarle a un recien nacido,"
"Look at my game time. This is just what I have on PC, not including the last two generations of consoles dating back to launch. This game was good at first but quickly fell into the MTX pit of doom where the entire game is based around leeching as much money as they can from you to fuel overpriced in game content that relies on an absurd amount of game time to achieve. They spent literally zero effort whatsoever on combatting the modding issue and never will fix it; that much is apparent. You will never be able to enter a server with or without friends and actually get anything done without being griefed into another dimension by modders and hackers.  It's a true shame because the core gameplay is good. Unfortunately because of the pricing of items, forced game time, MTX and modders this game isn't worth your time. Again, look at my hours spent. I've been trying to play for the last 2 weeks to just run some basic missions for businesses and get absolutely nowhere. When you get attacked by god mode modders and can't even rely on skill to overcome a challenge it's just lame and boring.   Do better, Rockstar. If GTA6 is anywhere near as bad in these regards, you will destroy your audience's faith in you."
spooky
"They can't be bothered to release this on PC for GTA6 so no point in supporting this pathetic filth of a company anymore. It has been 12 years and rockstar still isn't competent enough to announce PC, Xbox, and PS5 all on the same release day. They are more than capable, knock this shit off rockstar."
No bowling
Is fun game when punch face they die

ballcrack

WORTH IT
Gonna play this till GTA 6 comes out.
online is way too addictive
game is good but most features are pretty bad when in online as example animations are pretty slow when u get up and sometimes guns dont shoot
"Ah, nigga, don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful, nigga. Maybe if you got rid of that old yee-yee ass haircut you got you'd get some bitches on your dick. Oh, better yet, maybe Tanisha'll call your dog-ass if she ever stop fuckin' with that brain surgeon or lawyer she fucking with. Nigga..."
op gg
LET ME PLAY
Played it on PC. Now playing it on Steamdeck. Graphics look just like on PC. A steady 40fps on it. Imagine playing GTA5 anywhere.
fun game would recommend 5 stars
Onlines amazing
this game brings back old memories where i fuckin nuked cars
i don't have to say how good this game is right?
Nice to play
"If your impatient for GTA VI, then play this"
doink
Rockstar always gives  an extraordinary game . Better and more enjoyable than other games . GTA 5 is one of its best creations . Once you start playing you do not want to exit .
ahahah my n-word

"Lady, hear me tonight 'Cause my feeling is just so right As we dance by the moonlight Can't you see you're my delight?"
YEah DOG!
Gotta wait 10-15 years for each installment of the game - sucks - can't stop playing.
"when first buying the game its already a huge load on space. then if you want to play with friends it forces you to do a very long ""first time"" prologue and an online tutorial that are genuinely grueling to do. even when you play online theres loads of hackers who abuse tos and ruin gameplay. overall good game but these issues are a waste of time and need to be fixed or im not returning this game"
this game is fun asf
this game is littarly the best game bro
shit game dont buy wait for gta 6
U CAN LOT OF CRIME AND I APPROVE
👍👍👍👍👍
it is good entertainment
its has a really got story mode online is fun and game is fun in generall
worst experience of my life...    im a masochist and very much enjoy it <3
"do it, online is crazy use a vpn"
Playing it again on Steam Deck and PC now after originally playing through on XBox360 and various platforms since...what else can be said about this game! Bring on the slow countdown to GTA VI
"Really wanted to enjoy this but key binds in this game are fucked theres way to much of them and also weridly binded, Red Dead Redemption 2 did it so much better. Really upset because the story seemed cool but if a game fucks up its default key binds I just hate playing them. Also fuck your dumbass launcher. Hope they fix the keybind problems in 6 when it comes out."
GTA 6 is coming but you realize that it wont come until 2026 or 2027 : (
good game lots of hackers though........ looking forward  to gta 6
goodf
"WHERE IS MY FUCKING CRIMINAL STARTER PACK , btw killing da police is great"

"Don't know why I need to log into another game launcher to play a game I bought years ago.  And why another email is linked with my steam account, and why I can't unlink a steam account from the website even though the launcher says an account is already linked.  Remember your place Rockstar"
A legendary Game!

"""Warum GTA V auf dem PC das Nonplusultra ist – Eine Ode an die PC-Meisterrennen!""  Liebe Konsolenfreunde,  wir müssen mal ernsthaft reden. Ja, wir wissen, dass Konsolen ihre Vorzüge haben – die Bequemlichkeit, die in euren Wohnzimmern eingebaut ist, der einfache Plug-and-Play-Modus und natürlich das allumfassende Gefühl, euren Controller fest in den Händen zu halten. Aber wenn es um GTA V geht, müssen wir uns ein paar Dinge von der Leber schreiben. PC-Spieler, lehnt euch zurück und genießt, warum eure Version einfach unschlagbar ist!  1. **FPS-Flaute auf Konsolen:** Auf Konsolen gibt es dieses merkwürdige Phänomen namens ""Frames-per-Second-Fasten"" – oder kurz FPSF. Eure Konsole ist manchmal so langsam, dass selbst Schnecken darüber lachen würden. Auf dem PC dagegen fliegt man förmlich durch Los Santos, während Konsolenfreunde noch ihre Figuren in Zeitlupe steuern. 60 FPS? Pah! Wir reden von 144 FPS und mehr – als würden wir in einem Zeitstrudel durch die Straßen rauschen.  2. **Grafikpracht der Extraklasse:** Schaut euch mal die Grafik auf Konsolen an. Es ist, als würde man durch eine Brille aus Milch schauen. Auf dem PC hingegen baden wir förmlich in einem Meer aus High-Definition-Details. Die Sonnenuntergänge sind so atemberaubend, dass sie Picasso zu Tränen gerührt hätten – vorausgesetzt, er hätte GTA V gespielt.  3. **Modding-Manie:** Oh, arme Konsolenfreunde, könnt ihr Mods haben? Auf dem PC haben wir eine Armada an Mods, die das Spiel in alles Mögliche verwandeln. Von Superhelden, die Los Santos unsicher machen, bis hin zu realistischen Grafik-Overhauls – wir haben die Freiheit, unser Spiel zu gestalten, wie wir es wollen. Eure Konsolen dürfen höchstens von einem Bug träumen, der durch einen Zaubertrick behoben wird.  4. **Multitasking-Meister:** Während Konsolenfreunde GTA V spielen, müssen sie für jede Kleinigkeit das Spiel verlassen. Auf dem PC hingegen können wir während einer Verfolgungsjagd noch schnell unsere E-Mails checken, eine Pizza bestellen und das Weltfriedensproblem lösen – alles gleichzeitig!  Also, liebe Konsolenfreunde, wir lieben euch, aber wenn es um GTA V geht, müsst ihr zugeben: Der PC ist einfach das ultimative Spielparadies. Gebt zu, dass es ein kleines bisschen wahr ist – zumindest bis eure nächste Konsole herauskommt und wir alle von vorne anfangen!"
Why did I move here? I guess it was the steam servers.

"I'd advise to stay away from Public GTA Online lobbies they're full of modders that can kill you even in passive mode with stuff like earthquakes and steal your in-game currency, invite only lobbies are the only way to have fun in GTA 5 Online freemode these days it seems, I bought the game again after already having fond memories of it on the xbox and to get ready for GTA 6 so it's sad modders/scripters are there to spoil the fun."
its a good game. Just run away from people with opressor Mk II in gta -online
very cool game but cant eat the bear
"Its GTA, buy it"
this game has everything guns blood  cars tanks heils

"Its just great what else is there to say about GTA, its being one of the best games for years and this one lives to that expectation and I really like the multiple characters and how you can switch between them"
"After playing this game for a little bit, I can confidently say that it is a game."
bagus

I MEAN C'MON MAN ITS GTAV

No need to elaborate GTA 5.

The Best Game Ever Made
weerfbergbrtb
"hyper realistic driving simulator, my kids mastered it through this game only :D"
LOVE
I already play in other platform just wanted to add to steam because steam is the best and truly trust platform. No need to review the game because its a goat game and any new players who have not never played the game try the game.
"Tons to do, being able to seamlessly go from controller to mouse and keyboard makes it better."
good  big boobs
this is just a fun game and the controls are easy lol
"Holds up after 10 years. goddamn, rockstar makes great games."
"Straight dope! If you have not played this game, what is up with you? Have you been living under a crack rock?"
LOVE YOU ROCKSTAR

best game ever. -as tim cook says
wsg gang
"Highly dislike this game due to spending money on DLC's and I have yet to receive them after a month+, regret spending my money on this!! I bought this a while back and just downloaded the game today and didn't receive this product even though it's in my library. I got robbed of my money and I cannot even refund this product nor even contact the Support Team about it. Very disappointed!!  Update: I finally got my rewards after a good amount of play time and waiting a month. But still disappointed it wasn't awarded to me straight away as it caused me tons of drama that I did for nothing."
Nice!
jhjh
"amazing quality, amazing game"
its kinda good game for fun
It's GTA V. What more do I need to say?
wery god game
I recommend after 69 hours of gameplay
Dude its GTA.
"I got GTA 5 in 6th grade, and I am now legally allowed to drink with a nicotine addiction. Could've used GTA 6 by now. Would not recommend it."
Goody Good
played this the 100th time already this time on the steamver my frist time playing this was on the ps3 still gets me emotional
WHY i can not play this game ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
i drive
gooood gooodd
there are basketball big chocolate bars in this game W
"This is one of the best games if not the best game ever made, Once you start playing it there's no going back. It's addictive, It's beautiful, It's storyline, It's graphics are just so perfect that it doesn't feel like this game is a decade old. Cannot believe that GTA VI is so close now, I mean potentially over an year still it feels close. You should atleast complete the main story once because it's one of the best experiences ever made in gaming. Just a huge Rockstar Games worshipper and fan. :)"
Bought this crap to experience the online version just to find out its the most buggiest unplayable overrated garbage I've ever experienced in my life. GTA online is literally run by a bunch of pubescent neanderthals who literally over saturate the game with modded accounts endlessly shooting at people that are trying to play the game like a normal person and it literally doesn't help when the game is filled with cash grabbing overpriced items .
it does not accept my steam CD-key. i hate rockstar social club launcher. why u guys make another launcher for games? steam isnt enough? (less than 20 games doesnt need new  launcher) or add all RS games
its a good game for beginners
It is an really good game!! Not as good as OG games such as GTA Vice City and GTA San andreas .
i love the game because there is alot of cool glitched outfits!!!!!!!!!
i love this game.....
BEST OF ALL TIME
i lav gta

it's GTA 5
"rockstargames is is doing everything against money glitching, but they do nothing against cheater... Minecraft Anti Cheat Services are much better than Rockstar Games."
gta v the goat
"I got this for $5.40, and it already included the Criminal Enterprise Pack – the best Christmas gift, especially for access to GTA Online, which is my main interest. With the arrival of GTA VI on PC in 2026, I'll enjoy GTA V modding and online for the moment while waiting. Thanks, Rockstar!"

There is no better feeling than paying a hooker for their services and then killing them for a full refund.
"Fun and you can install mods, I would 100% recommend!"
GTA 6 IS COMING BOYSSS!!

THE BEST FR
good game too many cheaters and milked too much by rockstar
Had a kid in my class spoil the story when I was 11 shortly after this was released for PS3 and and 360 so I never cared to play and finish the game.  Here I am over a decade later finally giving it a go lol  Great game

"After 10+ years in Los Santos, it's time to move on a new game."
i like cheese and stuff
i hate basketball kfc ppl
15 euro well spent
Why did I move here? I guess it was The Grand Theft Auto all along.
GTA VI minus one. You've already played the game.
Why did i move here? I guess it was the weather. (reviewing the game while I have my lucky number as the playtime)
its really fun with friends but theres a lot of hackers and modders. it can be a pain at times.
i got my ip doxxed in online :D
very interesting its good as fuck
"I bought it for the 3th time ,now on steam.Until gta6 i think i will have 6 copies of gta5"
자유도가 엄청나다
pewpewppew
Played for years. Got locked out because of their crappy rockstar games app.
Best game  i have ever plaved
i dont have to say anything just play
"Yes, I've been playing the campaign, and as someone who's played a lot of good story games, GTA V has a middle story with bad protagonists, and that makes me prefer to do other things than just waste time playing a game where the story doesn't. engages (or entertains) me...  I mean, the story mode is no better than the previous games and it's all about the online mode, even new cars are only available online."
this gAme is very good game i like it very much
very good igra
It's amazing how much content GTA Online has after so many years. A year and a half would fly by waiting for GTA VI playing this!
wow amazing

"Tried, but didn’t like doing crime. GTA5 required shooting police officers in the opening scene. Just couldn’t do it."
i played this on playstation 3 heaps beforei got it on pc at my mates also Trevors intro
"the fact that the only thing they add to this game is the same heists, shows how much there putting into GTA 6. ion even play online on pc. i have over 100 hrs on xbox tho.  gta 6 better be better then RDR2"

"The Steam's intrigation with Rockstar games is very bad , I have made a successful purchase 24 hrs ago and still not got the dlc perks but its showing me that the dlc is installed but in the home page when game is launched the game is again asking me to buy.  why......  Steam asks you to get in support with the rockstar even its selling the game now its more than 24 hrs and Rockstar didn't even replied me yet about the ticket I generated......     Edit : After several weeks of Keyboard war I personally asked to be called by Rockstar and after 30 mins of discussions and proofs I got my Criminal Enterprise starter pack. I think that the integration system with steam and Rockstar is worse because the person on the other end of the call told me that They never got any money through steam . But he said steam initiated a bill for them but never paid them , that's the reason my criminal enterpise never got activated in the first place."
This game be looking better than real life
Where is GTA 6?
Even 10 years later in 2023 this game still slaps harder that my step dad's belt.

This game made me sell my soul for a broken economy. This game made me give up appropriately 20 days and 18 Hours. This game had made me lose hope in people   But over all I would recommend
"I have played this game for a little bit, it was fun."

"Cant login because the crappy RSC launcher. If i want to login into the Rockstar website i have to solve 16!!! crappy captchas, just so that it doesnt work.  Unbelievable!"
the yaoi angst game ever
I believe that the launch of GTA VI will not be as grand as the magnificent launch of GTA V if you disagree leave your like
Very fun and gangster. Just needs more Gold Chains and Gold teeth.

THIS GAME IS VERY INTRESTING

"Cool story, nice missions"

A game suitable for families to play together.bro u will not do that right?
GAME OF THE DECADE OR CENTURY BEST GAME EVER AND RDR 2 IS ALSO GOOD ROCKSTAR MAKES THE BEST GAMES IN THE WORLD
"My best friend told me if i post a rewiew for any game and this rewiew gets 30 liks and 22 Awards He will gives me his girlfriend and his car . I am leaving this here, please help."
"GTA V is one of the best games ever to be made in my personal opinion, the story line is so intriguing and the characters are amazing, if you've played this game alredy then here  are some suggestions on games with amazing graphics and an awesome storyline such as, Uncharted 4 A lost Legacy, Red Dead Redemption 2, and Mafia."
"This is a great game, it is 10 years old has bugs but overall this game i grew up with and i really recommend it to others. Me and all of my friends have had so many memories most definitely excited for gta 6 and most definitely worth the money."
"to start off, the first thing you will encounter playing this dogshit game is getting fucking molested by rank 900's on opressors that'll do anything to make your life a pain in the ass. when you then decide to switch sessions, you think that youre safe. youre not, the complete fucking opposite. this time, its comparable to switching from getting fucked in the ass by an elephant to a hairy fucking mammoth.  attempting to escape this onslaught leads to the natural instinct to switch sessions, hoping for a respite from the torment. little do you know, it's like trading one form of brutal violation for another, transitioning from the relentless pounding of an oppressor to the overwhelming assault of a hairy mammoth. the switch is far from an escape; it's merely a shift from one level of agony to another. hell-bent on making your virtual existence a living hell.  abso-fucking-lutely do not recommend you buy thisshit game and wait for gta 6 instead. thanks."

best game until gta vI
"Disastrous Experience with Rockstar's Customer ""Service""  I wish I could base this review solely on the merits of Grand Theft Auto V, a game that has captivated players worldwide with its immersive open world and engaging storyline. Unfortunately, my experience with Rockstar Games' customer service and Rockstar Games social club has been so abysmal that it significantly overshadows any positive aspects of the game.  Firstly, attempting to contact Rockstar's support is like navigating a maze designed to frustrate and exhaust customers. In my case, I encountered an issue due to the inability to log in to the Social Club using an outdated email address that is no longer in existence. After submitting a support ticket, I waited for days and received only preformatted administrative responses, to which I promptly replied with diligence. The support team then repeatedly requested the same information without taking into consideration the responses and content I provided to them. It's incredibly disheartening to invest time and money into a game only to have any potential enjoyment stripped away by lack of support. Even if by some miracle you manage to receive a response, the quality of assistance is subpar at best.   Rockstar Games' dismissive attitude toward its player base is unacceptable. When users encounter issues, they deserve timely and effective support, not a runaround that leaves them feeling ignored and frustrated. As a result, I cannot recommend Grand Theft Auto V or any other Rockstar title until the company addresses and improves its abysmal customer service."

very well made
rockstar did not send an activation code could not play game due to poor setup on rockstars end do not buy what a headache
was good 10 years ago devolved into pay to win trash
yeah uh i cant link another acc cuz some guy from russia hacked me so i cant log out of my current social club acc
"Very good game I love it and all since I have a lot of memories with this game from my childhood playing this in 2013, love the game and overal everything... but rockstar, please add an option to delet numbers, I have to many hookers on my in game phone and I can't find Lester's number anymore. Love the game and overal the rest is good  Can't wait for GTA VI ;)"
"For starters this game was launched in 2014 and still has the craze it had when it was launched. Rockstar games is one of the best franchise for open world games, thus because of the developers never disappoints with graphics and story mode. Truth be told i don't think that the craze of GTA will ever diminish. This is one of the best game for relaxation with a bit of creativity and huge load of missions. Also the online mode makes it impossible to ever stop playing with the latest updates getting released frequently."
i love this game very much its totally fun
"fun game for many years... amazing campaign. Unfortunately online is ruined by modders. Only thing you can do nowadays is either play the campaign, solo/invite only sessions, or join a Fivem server. Besides that, trying to play GTAO nowadays is pointless without a menu. Even then you run the risk of getting banned. Save your time/money and play something else until gta6 releases"
It very fun to go to the strip clubs  I KILLED A BOUNCER
Why did you kill Johnny K :(
this is very mind blowing game
smash
Till the time gta 6 arrives on pc.. this is the best game as far as i have played...
"Like all the other GTA V players I've owned it on XB360, PS4, XBO, XB-Series, May as well own it on PC too... So here I am. *Plus, couldn't beat the price it was on sale for*"
"Story mode is great, idk about online tho"
HIII
Grand Theft Auto V is very epic.
Gta 5
Everyone knows it is just Awesome
"Even 9 years later, this game is easily one of the best that you can buy.  Whilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I don't like - and wouldn't really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage - I can't ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities - there's something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make them money whilst they're at it.  Single Player is also undeniably a brilliant experience. Even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story, there's really no excuse for not playing it through at least once.  A lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since it's original release, but from an objective point of view, even if this game released for the very first time this year, it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away.  The driving is much easier than GTA 4, literally anyone can be a decent driver in GTA 5 unless you have brain damage, but I guess it makes it more accessible, lol. Shooting is also much improved and is high quality, and those two elements combined with many others, including but not limited to the excellent map, make this game a perfect sandbox."
"Even after all these years, still a wonderful game."
"My co-worker who I play GTA V with said if I post a review on GTA V, and it gets 666 likes and 66 Awards that they will buy me GTA VI and 1 set of GTA V OST Vinyl. So Im just gonna leave this here. Help a homies"
C'MON it's GTA what should I say?
another best game
yes but there was a hacker of 1 hour of me playing
"Fucking oppressor greifers. if your planning on buying this game, don't. Just waiting a couple more decades for gta 6"

"Grand Theft Auto VI: A Breathtaking Leap Forward, But Not Without Its Flaws Grand Theft Auto VI has finally arrived, and it's safe to say it's been worth the wait. Rockstar Games has once again delivered a sprawling, immersive, and often hilarious experience that pushes the boundaries of open-world gaming. But is it perfect? No, but it's still a must-play for any fan of the franchise.  The Good:  Stunning visuals: GTA VI boasts some of the best graphics ever seen in a video game. The world is incredibly detailed, from the bustling city streets to the lush countryside. Massive and diverse world: The game world is absolutely massive, and there's always something new to discover. You can explore sprawling cities, quaint towns, and everything in between. Engaging story: The story is well-written and full of twists and turns. It's also incredibly funny, with some of the best satire in the series. Improved gameplay: The gameplay has been refined and improved, making it more responsive and enjoyable than ever before. The new driving mechanics are particularly impressive. Online experience: GTA Online returns with a fresh coat of paint. There are new activities to try, new vehicles to drive, and new properties to purchase.  The Bad:  Technical issues: The game isn't without its bugs and glitches. While not game-breaking, they can be frustrating at times. Long loading times: Loading times can be quite long, especially when transitioning between different areas of the map. Microtransactions: GTA Online is once again filled with microtransactions, which can be a turn-off for some players.  The Verdict:  Grand Theft Auto VI is a phenomenal game that sets a new standard for open-world gaming. It's not without its flaws, but the good far outweighs the bad. If you're a fan of the series, or even just open-world games in general, then you owe it to yourself to check out GTA VI.  Overall Score: 9/10"
"""Modders"" are making my experience much worse than it could be. Constant bugged missions are no pleasure as it used to be even 2 years ago."
deeeeeeeees nuuut HA
"To be fair, the game has a really good story mode, But unfortunately its online component has become heavily problematic due to the sheer volume of users with various mod menus that make it harder for you to enjoy the game. My recommendation is based on the fact that you can only truly enjoy one part of the game, And that is the single player side."
ha ha ha
we all know this is the best game ever because of its open world and mods
My first experience in GTA Online which was 30 minutes ago was getting spawn killed by a modder/cheater blown up and then griefed by my own teammates. So far so good!  While this was my first experience im still continually playing this game and it has taken over my life for the past week and ive been grinding it for mostly every waking moment of my life as of currently.
THIS IS BEST GAME EVER
this game is so good if u want to have criminal group with other people and your friends.I will recommend you to try this sick game right now

"Best game to ever exist (besides hotline miami) 10/10. trevor on top, michaels cool to, franklins eh"
its game is so fantastic
cant fucking play because steam wont automatically log into rockstar launcher
"i am just going to post this here, GTA 6 won't live up to its hype and this game is going to be the last reminder of what GTA used to be, also bring back Trevor Philips, i know this is not GTA 6 review section but the reason i am not buying the hype og GTA 6 is the lack of crazy, I NEED CRAZY AND I NEED HUMAN MEAT SOUP lol jk  I love GTA 5 for its social commentary, i used to play GTA games for guns, shooting and stuff but i wasn't interested in the stories until GTA 5 something about betrayals and craziness made the story attractive, GTA 5 10\10 experience. i recommend this game simply for the story"

"Bought and played this game a few years ago and loved playing the single player game. Game play was so much fun and the story is awesome, but....  Rockstar now requires you to have and log into a social club account and you must be on-line the entire time...even if you are only playing single player.   I have not played in over a year and when I try to play the single player game it will not let me. Rockstar is not letting me log into my social club account and it seems there is some issue with the linking of my Steam account with Rockstar. On Rockstars webpage I am able to log into my account, but anything about linking does not apply to Steam and only mentions PS, Xbox, ...... ,which all had links for fixes.  I would not buy any Rockstar games through Steam, as you will not have any easy fix if there is any issue with the linking of your Steam account to Rockstar.  I would not recommend this, or any other Rockstar game and unfortunately I will not be purchasing any more games from them as long as they continue to have this requirement to play single player games."
❤️‍🔥
very fun game where you can explore and do pretty much anything
IT GTA 5? WHY DON'T U HAVE IT
Love driving around  pretty long grind but so fun after you get everything
its skibidi
"Amazing game, first got it on PS3 then PS4 the difference was insane, and now PC   Can't wait for GTA 6, this time on PS5."
i like gta rp
Yea
one of the best game of all time.
"This companie was, is, and always will be trash.  After almost 10 years of owning the game, it now asks for my CD key. Lucky me, steam provides key even after almost a decade! BUT This shitty compagnie is telling me that my key is already used. DUUUUUH BY ME! So now, after 10 years and more than 200h i can't play the game anymore. Support not helping or proposing voodoo stuff (like deleting folders that doesn't fix anything)  It's nice that it's happening just few days after the release of GTA6 trailer. It will reminds me to NEVER give them any more money. I'll find another way to play their game *wink wink*"
"there was a little guy named guy. was an adventurous and curious guy who always had a million questions in his mind. One day, guy came across a wise old man guy sitting under a tree.  Excitedly, guy approached the old man guy and said, ""guy, I've heard that you know the answer to every question in the world. Is that true?""  The wise old man guy smiled and replied, ""Indeed, my young friend guy. I possess the knowledge to answer any question you might have. What would you like to know?""  guy eyes lit up with excitement as he thought of a challenging question. ""Okay,"" he said, ""Tell me, what is the meaning of life?""  The old man guy chuckled and said, ""Ah, that's a question that has puzzled humanity for ages. The meaning of life is like a vast ocean with countless depths, and each person must embark on their own journey to discover it.""  guy frowned, feeling a bit disappointed with the answer. ""But, guy,"" he persisted, ""Can you give me a more specific answer? Something more concrete?""  The old man guy nodded and replied, ""Very well, my young friend guy. Let me tell you a story.""  ""Long ago, there was a powerful guy who ruled over a vast guydom. One day, the guy summoned three of his bravest guys and gave them each a quest. The first guy was sent on a mission to find the most precious gemstone in the world. The second guy was tasked with finding the rarest flower that only bloomed once every hundred years. And the third guy was commanded to find the secret to eternal happiness.""  ""So, each guy embarked on their respective journeys, determined to fulfill the guy's wishes. The first guy traveled far and wide, searching through treacherous mountains, vast deserts, and deep oceans. After years of relentless pursuit, he finally found the most precious gemstone hidden within a mystical cave.""  ""The second guy ventured into enchanted forests, climbing towering peaks, and crossing dangerous swamps. It took him decades, but eventually, he discovered the rarest flower blossoming in a secluded meadow.""  ""As for the third guy he wandered through bustling cities, remote villages, and explored the deepest corners of the human heart. He spoke with wise sages, studied ancient scriptures, and tasted the flavors of life. After a lifetime of exploration, the knight realized that true happiness lies not in possessions or achievements, but in the simple moments of joy, love, and connection shared with others.""  ""Years later, the three guy returned to the guydom, presenting their findings to the GUY. The first GUY offered the most precious gemstone, the second GUY presented the rarest flower, and the third GUY shared his wisdom about the secret to eternal happiness.""  ""The GUY was pleased, but he couldn't help but feel that something was missing. He pondered for days until he finally realized that the true meaning of life lay not in seeking external treasures or ephemeral pleasures, but in living a life of purpose, compassion, and making a positive impact on the world.""  ""So, my dear GUY,"" the old man GUY concluded, ""The meaning of life is a personal journey, filled with adventures, discoveries, and the pursuit of goodness. It is about finding your own purpose, embracing love and kindness, and leaving a lasting legacy that resonates with future generations.""  GUY listened intently, absorbing the old man's words. A smile appeared on his face as he thanked the old man GUY for his wisdom. With a newfound understanding, he walked away, ready to embark on his own journey to uncover the meaning of life.  And so, the story continues, with GUY forging his own path, seeking answers, and making the most out of every precious moment of his existence.  Remember, my GUY, the meaning of life may be elusive, but it's in the journey itself that we find purpose, fulfillment, and true happiness. WHO?"
its a good game just wish you could use the scope's on the guns  if you do know how to use them then pls tell me

A lot more fun then I thought  I like the mechanic of ragdolling when jumping to people
trisha
"I mean, it's Gta 5, nothing more and nothing less. It was $15 CAD when I got it, and I only got it because I was peer pressured, don't be me, play it at a friends house and see whether it's for you or not. Also it's over a 100 Gb, which is kinda stupid."
Gas game
Customer support from rockstar was great. Thanks to them I was able to get my rockstar account back and wouldn't have been able to play the game after all these years. This is a great game still and is pretty well optimized even with my old pc setup. Would recommend!
"Experience is horrible, this sh1t runs worse than Stephen Hawking on coke. The stripers look like they came straight out of coolmathgames.com, never seen more polygons on a woman since the last lady gaga music video."
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
yery good
"Even cannot launch this game because of Rockstar Launcher stopping me with errors and asks to contact Game Support. Why? I have only bought this game, I want to play not dance with issues. What a stupid decision to have their own launchers who nobody asked."
i love this game it has a good story line and it is allso fun to play when your bord
"The game is top-end, I advise everyone."
"It's GTA V, it doesn't need an introduction."
"well, it's GTA..."
GTA is always good
"Great fun game, but of course it has hackers, and trollers that affecting your gameplay"
"10/10 one of the best games ever made, just wish I could have transferred all my play station data on the pc version since I spent hundreds of hours on that so I had to restart from zero, also wish I could have played with my friends on play station. other then that I CAN'T WAIT FOR GTA6"

"Rockstar are greedy, and they will be in GTA 6's Online mode too, just a heads up."
Delaying GTA 6 release on pc. Same scummy marketing tactics they've done numerous times.
"Super Fun! Doesn't Have Mods unless you get them from Some Sketchy Website But Its still is Good game, Although You Should Wait For a sale Cause its not worth the like $40 That it is also It Will Take Like 21 Hours to install and i had to sit Through it all at like 3:05 Am and when i got it i couldn't Even Play it When it was done Cause i had To create an account and i don't have an email cause I'm Like 12 Also Also Yes My Parents Let Me Play This Game also Press The ""~"" Button *Or ""`"" Button* And You Will Pull up the Cheats Page Thing type The right Things like ""PainKiller"" For Invincibility Or ""Cachme"" For Super Speed and ""Toolup"" For Rpg Gernades exetera There Are More codes but You Can Search Them Up."

GOODDD GAMMEEEE
thats the nice game i ever played in my entire life
the end of the game is near. 2025.
I only bought it for LSPDFR.
"The game is full of degenerates making it impossible to play the heists as intended. when one F#&K up dies you have to restart again, ive been trying to complete the prison break heist for the last 4/5 hours of my game time. Its such a good game but you spend most of your time online waiting in lobbys and playing the same setup or heist finale over and over again because people either constantly die, F up somehow or my fav so far play the whole mission perfectly and then leave at the very last second for no reason failing the mission instantly. Wronguns! I love to hate it 23 hours later i have completed series A heist and have crashed/froze/glitched upwards of 50times"
just awesome
we really got GTA5 before GTA6
Well what to say about this best game ever
"cool, old but a classic"
ALI
"underground game, pretty good some people haven't heard of it but totally cool (this is a joke)"
10/10  Rockstar Games Presents...
"I bought PC version a long time ago but never really played it since I played it on my console already. Now that GTA VI is confirm I thought ""why not play the PC version now that I have better PC"". But I can't even launch the game, I told me I'm not login to my rockstar social club and show me a weird email I don't even know. Apparently some hacker go around changing people games email for some reason, Contacting rockstar didn't do anything.  I'm so done with this bullshit I wish I could deleted this game from my library, and go F yourself with GTA VI. I'm not buying your product again rockstar."

I will literally take a week off work just to properly play it, Thankyou Rockstar for creating such pieces of art"

"Preposterously enjoyable, breathtaking in scope and bitingly funny, GTA V is a landmark game."
"Title: Grand Theft Auto V on Steam - A Masterpiece of Open-World Gaming  Introduction: Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) has long been hailed as a pinnacle in the open-world gaming genre, and its presence on Steam only solidifies its status as a timeless masterpiece. Developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, this fifth installment in the iconic Grand Theft Auto series has captivated players worldwide since its initial release in 2013. Now, with its availability on Steam, players can experience the thrilling chaos of Los Santos with the added benefits of the Steam platform.  Graphics and Visuals: One of the first aspects that strike players upon launching GTA V is its breathtaking graphics. Even years after its release, the attention to detail in the game's design is commendable. The bustling city of Los Santos comes alive with stunning visuals, from the glimmering skyscrapers to the gritty streets. The character models are incredibly detailed, and the dynamic weather and lighting effects add a layer of realism that enhances the overall immersive experience.  Storyline and Characters: The narrative of GTA V is a triumph in storytelling within the gaming industry. The game weaves together the lives of three distinct protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor – each with their own compelling backstory and unique personality. The intersecting narratives provide players with a diverse range of missions and activities, ensuring that boredom is never a factor. The characters are well-written, bringing a mix of humor, drama, and intensity to the table. The engaging storyline is further complemented by top-notch voice acting, creating a cinematic feel throughout the game.  Open-World Exploration: GTA V sets the standard for open-world exploration. The sprawling city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas offer a vast and diverse landscape for players to explore. From the vibrant city center to the desolate desert, every corner of the map is filled with activities, secrets, and random encounters. Whether cruising the streets in a high-end sports car, skydiving from a plane, or engaging in adrenaline-pumping heists, the game offers unparalleled freedom, ensuring that every playthrough is a unique adventure.  Heists and Missions: The heist system in GTA V stands out as a gameplay highlight. Planning and executing elaborate heists with a crew add a strategic layer to the game, encouraging players to think critically and choose their approach carefully. The variety of missions keeps the gameplay experience fresh and exciting, ranging from high-speed chases to intense shootouts. The seamless transition between characters during missions enhances the overall sense of teamwork and coordination.  Multiplayer Experience (GTA Online): GTA Online, the multiplayer counterpart to the single-player campaign, is a dynamic and ever-evolving online world. The multiplayer mode introduces a plethora of activities, from races and heists to business ventures and criminal enterprises. The constant updates and additions by Rockstar ensure that GTA Online remains a vibrant community, fostering social interaction, competition, and cooperation among players.  Modding Community and Steam Workshop: One of the significant advantages of owning GTA V on Steam is the access to the extensive modding community. The Steam Workshop provides a convenient platform for players to discover and install mods, enhancing the game with new features, visual enhancements, and custom content. The modding community has played a crucial role in keeping the game relevant and exciting for years after its initial release.  Conclusion: Grand Theft Auto V on Steam is a testament to the enduring legacy of the game. With its unparalleled graphics, captivating storyline, open-world freedom, and a thriving online community, GTA V continues to stand as a benchmark for open-world gaming. Whether you're a veteran fan or a newcomer to the series, the Steam version offers a seamless and feature-rich experience, making it a must-have in any gamer's library. GTA V is not just a game; it's a living, breathing world waiting to be explored and conquered.  -chat gpt"
"Even at $14 I'm really regretting this purchase and most of that is because the absolute bullcrap you have to go through to play the game.  The launcher is a mess, the social club requirement is extremely irritating, and the forced internet access would throw up captchas for me constantly and then after completing over a dozen puzzles it would then say I got one of them wrong and make me start over with even more puzzles.  As for gameplay, I'm not at all a fan of that either.  I am a very casual gamer but I liked previous GTA games from years ago which sadly are no longer on Steam so I figured I'd give this one a shot thinking it would be similar but it feels completely different....  I'm not a fan of forced paths which story mode kind of locks you in to.  There were certainly moments that I enjoyed playing it but it always seemed to end up pushing me into a segment that I just found myself zoning out and just losing interest. Maybe I'm weird but if I'm playing a game, I like to play a game and if I'm watching TV, I like to watch TV -- I don't want to switch between the two constantly.  One other frustration is that the game makes a very weak attempt at trying to get you used to specific buttons and actions and many times pops up dialog telling you stuff while you're trying to complete something else (like racing down the road, etc).  I'll probably play around with it again in the future but honestly, game play aside, the launcher and social club stuff is absolutely something that makes me not want to recommend this.... had I realized that I was going to spend an hour downloading it and then over an hour trying to get things set up (launcher, configuration, irritating login set up, etc) I would have never started down this path."
"This game sucks, Rockstar needs to hang themselves"
Nikki went crazy!
"Loved the part where the girl is in prison and the other girl goes ""Do you know why you're here"" and the first girl goes ""bad luck I guess"" and then it cuts to a porn montage."
I had so much fun playing this game for 100 hours I think I can build the life I have never had in this game in the online mode the that I dream to have but not know how to build it on real life
nice game and very cool missions in this game
goodd game
Ta piola
the best game   \
"Bought this game in middle of Covid2019 in a sale At that time, the game loading take forever to join an online session,  Hope that they fix that problem"
Arguably the G.O.A.T.

"The Game is very fun, but you need a good pc for the game. I recommend it"
Because GTA VI is console exclusive!
very good game yes
I very much like the gameplay and story
trevor kinda...
LIKE IT
Run while you still can
locked out because of a lost email account and 0 customer support from rockstar.
Great Game and great storyline!

An awesome game. Looking forward to GTA VI when it comes out so y'all should play this before it comes out in 2025
just a classic game overall. played since it came out and cannot wait for the next one. hope they keep their integrity (i'm talking to you rockstar).

Rockstar made off with all our money. We cant say shit.
amazing game bro
super fun campaign and the multiplayer is pretty great with friends
o9i8yuuti
impossible human tests to prove you are human to play a fucking singleplayer game.
"Yeah, Baaaang"
give gta 6
Literally cannot play this game or any other Rockstar game through steam as my steam account is linked to some random social club account that is not mine.
Pretty good love spending cash in the online so i can get an oppressor mk2 and start flying around turning los santos into an active warzone
goooooooooooooooooooooood
Reading Review For this Banger ??? Really ? Just buy it
Logging in is an absolute joke that makes all desire to play the game vanish.
Yes play it until 6 comes out
this is my favorite game and it's been since 2012 when I started playing it as a kid
"pretty good, fun to customize cars lol. rob stores :D"
gta 6 makes my penis hard
strip club is fun
I've been playing this game since the 5th grade. Gta 6 can't come fast enough.
GG GTA 6 TOP

My body is ready for GTA VI.
GTA VI for PC you monsters.
main game: great online mode: filled with hacking pos that rockstar wont do anything about. Good job you cock sucking dumb-asses. 0/10
when i first startted it was fun but i got board and went to rp when i started i had to sell to orphan kids to some somalian pirates just soo i could join a gang and then get kicked out because i was a tad bit too racist tbh it wasent that deep even though i spoke about there whole family tree. anyways w game w mans cant wait for gta 6 probs gonna die from the cancer i have before it comes out.
GTA VI here we come. This game is tuff but its time for somethin new

"Shit man, this game is one hell of a game, one hell of a story."
There are multiple masked men in my property.
Still waiting for GTA 6
great game to play with friends
no need for review everybody knows this game
Rockstar is probably the best game company in modern days.
gta 6 january 2025?
yes king
"Awesome game. The graphics are amazing, the amount of mods you can get and change are incredible. The community in gta V is fun to interact with and its always fun hopping on not knowing what is going to happen. My favorite mod for GTA V as of right now is LSPDFR cause I like doing police work. Highly recommend if you are like me. Definitely get especially at the price of just 15 dollars right now."
"I'm not a 45 year old father, sorry. But the game is good"
haw do i get my whale card
It is really good and everyone knows it.
IT VERY FUN. ONLINE CAN BE A BIT BAD SOMETIMES BUT ITS MOSTLY GOOD. I LOVE YOU ROCKSTAR CANT WAIT FOR GTA VI
Training for GTA 6 in 2025.
man its gta
gta vi better
doesn't work on steam anymore.
Amazing game can do anything you want basically
Fucking hate this game
(Act like this comment is absolutely hilarious)
This game is one of the best story games of all time and i highly recomend this to anyone
when will gta 6 come out
Rockstar story modes are always the peak of gaming
play runescape kids
excelent
"GTA 5 is a fantastic game but adding the rockstar launcher to it makes it not so much, be ready for this in 4 years with GTA 6 lmao"
"Lots of Grand Theft, Not alot of auto"
Best game for crime and car events <3
GTA is life!
bra
TGUKUYK
i like punching women
"Well, I visited this game after wondering what I missed out on and, well it's ok. There's better GTA games but this one has a lot to do."

gamble to buy hookers and kill people
"The launcher is stupid and pointless. Please remove it from all your games. I prefer the PC platform, but want a console experience on my Steam Deck. You do not do this on PlayStation and Xbox, why do you hate your PC players?"
love killing the opressor kids
Fun game overall but the fact that you cant keep your car while going around in story mode because if you take your car to a mission it might dissaper when you are done with the mission. And you cant always get it back from the police station which sucks
i want to kys
L tbh
I liked everything about this game
"Not even an hour in, saw a modder flying a ww2 Aryan symbol. Lmfao."
A very good game; - no more to say.
Great Game.
iiiii loooove it
"hehehe im like the ga,me weri gud and fan veri much"
It's just GTA.
Loading screen and hacked server simulator. Rockstar is as in touch with its player base as a locked up pedo is with kids with about the same outlook just looking to fuck them.
Car go vroom
gang gang ass game
"First of all it is undeniably a great game which makes it so much worse when you want to enjoy the outstanding Online Mode but just can't because you'll get a stroke from being annoyed out of your mind from the Online mechanics.  Everything in the Online Mode is made to be as annoying and time wasting as possible.  Be it unskippable endless dialogue or your character being to stupid to walk in a straight line or just random events and dumb NPCs to make every mission as annoying and as time consuming as possible.  In combination with the outdated and super buggy movement mechanics you will die many times without it even being your fault.  And if you have the patience of a saint you will perhaps not rage quit after the sixtiest time you randomly explode with the slow ass delivery vehicle because an NPC wanted to sideswipe you for no  reason while going 250 on the highway. And sadly we all know why this is the case, so you are more inclined to skip the unplayayble and annoying grind for money and just buy shark cards.  It could be an outstanding game, but rockstar created a grindy, buggy and often unplayable mess to squeeze some more Shark Card buys out of their player base. Ok the rant is over, thank you for reading if you made it this far! And again for the Fanboys, i love GTA V, i love the online mode, otherwise i would'nt play it for hundreds of hours. But when you have to grind this much in a game where a million dollars barely gets you a used broken down PoS Car the grind should at least be fun and not punishing you at every step just for playing."
gta 5 before gta 6 smh
good game no cap
YES I WOULD NOT RATE IT 18 YEARS
"We all know what GTA is all about, the game-play is amazing! Apart from obviously some glitches here and there which can be improvised. But yeah one cant expect such smooth game-play when tons of users play it at the same time and also a few who use mods.  Overall, a VERY good game to play and the story line rocks!"
Just make sure not to drive anything that resembles a hellcat or some black guy will come steal it...
"Always have liked the game but now that i am returning to gaming it will not let me play since it wants me to connect to internet and make an account even to play ofline. i paid for this on my ps3, ps4 and pc and now they will not let me play, was a waste of money. it never was neccesery before so i do not know since which update but hate it. Just let me play the game i paid for rockstar!!!!!!  never paying for rockstar again."
It's a brilliant game that is made better just by the fact i can blow my friends up with a bomb truck. It's even more amazing that the game can run fine on my low end pc on high settings with practically no preformance issues.
it is a good game but online is kinda toxic and a lot of grifers and hackers but its a perfect game for people who are finding a good story mode.
Good game i would recommend for nostalgia even if gta 6 is coming out in 2025

He is GOOD GAME
wheres gta 6? this game is milking a dead cow
Memories
"Stuck on loading screen after 1st mission, poggers."
"Shitty move c0ckstar, again with releasing the PC version of GTA 6 later than the rest? gotta endure all the spoilers and shit, I'll be buying GTA 6 from a second hand vendor not giving R* a cent and I'm gonna give it a negative review for pulling that delay double dip bullshit, f4cking idiots."
Cool.
yes this is the great game
game don't load
"Just buy it, the best game of the decade, Rockstar's attention to detail is mind blowing. Can't wait for GTA 6"
Great game to play
I love the theme and genre of the game and all the crime and action that is happening throughout the city I also love the stereo types and the characters and the violence I would without a doubt recommend this game
is funny
its a goat level game and gta 6 is a much then beter
With a total of 4.000 hours played on the PS4/PS5 version of Grand Theft Auto V I decided to buy it on PC.  I think that the PC version is totally worth it. Why? I guess it was the weather.
better than gta 6 anyway
Fast and fury V

pow pow pow kaboom vroom vroom drugs drugs drugs
i want gta 6
This game is unforgettable..💔
"This was the new San Andreas back then. Now we are approaching the new Vice City.  In hindsight I think GTA V is a great game. I cannot vouch for the GTA V Online because I never played it, but the Singleplayer experience is great. It is a very immersive and massive game with interesting character stories and lots of Californian clichès.   If Rockstar makes GTA VI as well as this one I'm sure it's going to be great.   Looking at sales they certainly have the money for it now."
"gta 5 online is so fun to play i can't even describe it.There is lots of stuff to to and lots of money to be made,don't miss out."
I have gender envy for my online character :3
A game of all time
"this game servers are bad, the game keep on crashing and it takes time to open everytime."
PC never got the next gen update.  Rockstar always treats PC as second class citizens.
LOVE OF MY LIFE i can say because my mental health is now good and i feel fresh after playing gta
It's game isn't good
я гей
fire game needs gta 6 out rnrn
best game for years
Wonderful Experience
I'm addicted like crack
GTA VI let`s fucking GOOOOOOOOOO
Gonna miss this game when GTA VI comes out
kill people with sticky bomb
we got razer rgb car before gta vi :))
SHITTY LAGGING ASS GAME
"when i am posting this there GTA 6 trailer is out!!!  I had always a dream to play gta 5 but i dont had a pc so i playes gta sa really long, but 1 month ago i purchased a pc with my own hardwork money (i am a kid 16 y/o) and i searched how to play gta v free but  you what i found nothing :) but then i thought that maybe i should buy the game, so i just bought it from my parents dc and want to you know one thing that this game is not a game its emotion for a player like me... yeah you can say me child i dont mind... but after a long period of waiting i enjoyed this masterpiece, rockstar studios reaaly know how to make games, if you reading till now.. stay happy, have a good day. :)"
"I believe by now, the whole world knows about GTA 5. So, no need to recommend to friends or public."
cant wait to leave los santos been stuck in there since 2013
There are cheaters in every lobby
yall alreadyy knoo dis game fyee its literally real life with different physics
GTA Online: Sometimes full of modders. (toxic) or friendly modders. or little kids  GTA Story mode: fun to run mods with but turn them off in GTA Online unless you want a ban.  GTA 5 Is a great game. Fun while it lasted Now i wait for GTA 6 to come out.
It's GTAV what else is there to say?
GTA 6 IS COMING GUYS AND I'M COMMING TOO LESSSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"This game is pretty awesome, i would suggest playing the story before you play online. The online mode is pretty shit. Modders are everywhere, and unless you have a really expensive imani tech vehicle, you'll probably be hearing ""beep beep beep"" and the ""kaboom"" a lot. But the story is really fun, the characters are built really well, which is rather on track for Rockstar North."
guns.
"Fun, modders get pretty weird online though. Story mode good."
"So much fun, whether you're playing 5 minutes or 5 hours at a time."
shesessh
"was playing with my dad in the room and my friend said ""go into the shoe shop they just released Nike Jordans""  and i go ""aw sick lemmie check it out"" there where no Nikes"
Awfully fun game! Shame it's literally broken and 99% unplayable despite ten years of updates!
im dating allison
foretniteP✨✨✨
greatest game of all time cant wait for 6!!!!
"Great game, but the gamekiller bug (car moving in parking lot, killing a character, causing an unskippable quest to fail) that is well known and still not fixed (tried three different pc setups) makes me give it a thumbs down. Never finished it for that reason, since downloading a save past that quest makes the game, progress etc not seem like mine doing.  Excited for GTA 66 though ;)"
"This is the best GTA game so far. Highly recommend, it is so fun with hours upon hours of play time."
Good game. Nothing else to say.
w game gta5-mods.com
goooooooood gooooooood
gta v
great game!just perfect!
to many hackers- including me
"With GTA VI trailer released, I am reviewing this masterpiece. It is one of the best game out there. Full of entertainment, multiplayer fun and a great experience. Looking forward to GTA 6 with hopes in eyes. Thank you Rockstar for never disappointing us."
one of the best game ever
Its GTA whats more to say
i can t sing in my acc
"The online mode is rightfully criticized but not enough praise has been given to this game's story and satire. For an open world game of this scale to have a narrative that intertwines with three characters while each giving them enough room for personal stories is monumental achievement even if the gameplay and mission structure isn't doing anything revolutionary. It's not a masterpiece like RDR2, but it is an excellent game"
"best video game of all time, no competitionn"
"We deserve to play GTA VI on launch just as much as consoles do! This is and always has been a shitty formula, Rockstar."
its a great fucking game buy it or suck ya mums fat titties
ROCKSTAR HATES PC PLAYERS AHHHHHH!!!! !! ! !!!! !!1 !!! ! 1
its GTA its going be great
pretty fun with friends but when you play by yourself it kinda boring
GTA 6 TRAILER IS OUT BOYS
Please Help me My Gta 5 Login problem
"it is little different on the pc, I dont like that you can't play with people on Xbox and we are both Microsoft"
"jh,mg"
"With friends GTA online provide plenty of mission, Heists and random stuff to keep everyone entertained for countless hours... hackers are annoying but not that bad anymore  at least for us"
classic game
is game
jake hazen is a baddie ;)
very interesting specimen in the online world of gta 5
greatest gam e ever
very nice :)
10/10  Yes.
I didn't enjoy the story or the game play.
"why the fuck in 2025 would you cut off 1/3 of possible device to play your new game, for those who don't know Rockstar and take two have had the ingenious to only release GTA 6 on Xbox and PlayStation, its a total kick in the balls to fans of the series who did want to spend $500+ on a console considering we already have a pc that blows them out of the water, and I know how this will play out we will wait until 2026 or 2027 to get GTA 6 and it will still cost $150+ which is just stupid we waited over 10 years for this just release it all at the same time and save the hate"
Fam its gta 5
Rockstar games launcher fixed by reinstalling windows
GOAT I CANT WAIT FOR 6
Why did i move here? I guess it was the weather.
its GTA...
yeah its old now
SUPER!
Very bad game. Very violent. It almost made me commit an act of terror in real life.
fun kill pedestrians
"Grand Theft Auto VI will come out in 2026 for pc, this is a total disrespect to a large number of players."
"nice one, it made my childhood :)"
Tom Petty
i like hacking
"pretty good vehicle handling, gunplay feels amazing, pretty optimized for PC. i never liked GTA V before, but now i might just changed my mind"
"Still holding up in 2023, didn't expect GTA V to be entertaining till 2023"
i want to kms
its good but a lot of bugs it woud be good to fix them
yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
gg............................
Why did I move here? I guess it was Grand Theft Auto VI.
lots of fun.
Shoot blacks
God forbid anything happens to your rockstar account then your shit outta luck until rockstar deigns to answer your request to play the game that you paid for.
!good!
most cars good for head. 10/10  must get head
so awesome
"[h1] Well, we'll wait for GTA 6)... [/h1] [spoiler] Wait another 3 years. [/spoiler]"
the best game in histery buy it and who dousnt know it see ya
Extremely addictive and anti-social.  Highest recommendation.
"Very nice game , i like the story."
"Do not buy. You will spend more time trying to log in than actually playing the game, why the hell do i need to log into an age old rockstar account to play single player on my steam game."
Best Game Ever
"If you buy this just for GTA Online then you are an idiot. Have fun dealing with boring drip fed content, greedy t2, and cheaters. The only way to avoid cheaters in GTAO is to play on a console, then you have to deal with children griefers. However, single player modding capabilities and multiplayer server mods like FiveM make it enjoyable and an experience like no other game. 10/10 endless mod possibilities"
GTA 6 BABY WHOOOOO!
Waiting for GTA 6!
hakoona matata
SAD

gee tee ayy severn when rokster gambs?
Adiktud
GTA 6 BABYYY LESSS GOOOO
thanks
meah game
This game is very addictive
this game is more fun than my homeworks. you should play it if you burnout with the homeworks :p
"this game will consume you and its community sucks. anti-cheat is nonexistent too  Play this game with friends for a night of fun and dont let it consume you with grinding, if you are going to buy it."
umm i dont know anything
"one of my favorite games! 10/10 ,"
It feels good to blow up cars & slaughter people.
GTA VI IS COMING BABYYY!!!!
The story is magnificient its  like none ever made but online gets boring after a few days
"Best game, period."
GTA 6 IS COMING !!!
just do it.
The cayo perico grindset
"Let's think about the appearance of a statue that excludes the aura of a real person believed to exist in the idea world, and its internal implications are undermined. The problem with this is whether it is due to the appearance of the statue or the reason for its implications.  The problem that hitting human-like polygons in the game is considered violent is caused by us roasting human-like dough. We roast dead meat. Why do we think hitting human-like polygons is bad, as we are disgusted at how sympathetic they are to the picture of fried shrimp falling into oil?  Are all of these psychological factors caused by objects that resemble the human quality? Why should your separate body listen to your command and comply with it if you hit it? Because it's just a polygon and it's not alive? It certainly has a human form. From what you're doing, human dignity does not exist in objects that have a human form.  Objects that do not have human dignity have bodies by human perception. The realization of a psychologically acting material obscures the distinction between real and fictional. Therefore, an object that resembles the human quality is embodied as a substance in human perception, plays the role of a falcon that operates in reality, and causes a psychological change in the human viewing it."
"I only play LSPDFR and 5M. But all-in-all, this is a miraculous game to play when trying to kill time."
"Loved the game, have it on Xbox too. Only issue was hackers on PC, Rockstar really dropped the ball on keeping it clean. Looking forward to 6!"
"""I did not kill him, but I did kidnap his wife"" - Trevor"
"Best game in history, and about as anti-woke as possible. Fuck you Starfield."
like what do i gotta say one of the best games exspecially if you play online and maybe with five m rp
forever fun
See y'all in Vice City
don't let your dad into the room while in the shoe store

This Game Never Get Bored
playing the game for 2 years and never got disappointed with the graphic and stuffs new missions in the online mode rocks
gud 👍
killing is bad.
Super fun to RP and get to know how to really play the game.  What's my phone number again?
I'm 100% sure that this is Fortnite.
GTA 5 IS ONE OF THE BEST GAME I HAVE PLAYED. ITS GRAPHICS IS VERY GOOD.
FUCK YOUR GAMES AND FUCK YOU TOO ROCKSTAR
one of the benchmark open world simulators. one of the GOATs
pc delayed moment
i am unable to install he game or unable to buy its not showing in my liberary  and after the refund i am unable to purchase the game
we need GTA 6 In 2024
goated game ngl
if they decide to release gta 6 on rockstar games launcher along with Epic only after the stupid 1 year wait of console exclusivity I'm definitely not buying it and waiting for a cr*ck
"changed review due to gta 6 being not announced for pc, boycott rockstar"
NICE G
It's literally grand theft auto my guy.. ofc positive review
я только игру прошел а тут уже трейлер гта6
its game is very good
Rate this down this until R* decides to release upcoming titles on same date for all platforms.
555
If you have lobbies to play just do it up!
Same 2003 game play with even more racism and sexism?  The combat is now super bad and the only thing R Star seems interested in is making a better looking game not a better performing game. Online was rife with hacks/ unfriendly folks too.
the best stress relifer
GTA 6 IS COMING
The game's the game
"Platforms announced for GTA6 and yet again, PC is being sidelined as an afterthought for later.   PC players have brought in hundreds of millions for Rockstar in GTAV and yet they still, after all this time and countless millions later, disregard the PC platform. Beyond disgraceful."
it ok
fun and broken game (recomended)
Coming 2025
Was here before GTA VI.
5stars\
GTA 6 is coming in 2025!
Rockstar Games... just try it
bring gta 6 :((
2025 ?
its the shit
Still gonna play it even after GTA 6 comes out.
great graphics and gameplay
GTA SA   the best of all time
provided already used CD code  worst
เกมดี
its trash. full of cheaters . its a normal thing to teleport or be visible or never die for players . if the servers gonna be like this i offer you to play fan made servers
"GTA VI!  Oh my god! Okay, it’s happening! Everybody stay calm!"
"if you like chaos, fun, epic, and being horny. This is the right game for you"
hay
ICONIC
im only getting started
bye bye gta we have 6 now
Best open world game out today until GTA VI ofc!
"very easy to cheat and mod cars. I like car modding and giving strangers rides at 400+ kph. Griefers are annoying tho, be responsible with your mod menu"
Perfect Game
Here after GTA 6 Trailer
very cool fun
"Honestly, GTA 5 is a fun game that includes multiplayer and single player. In multiplayer you can choose to play in online servers or with your friends! On the other hand, singleplayer is also fun for users who wanna play alone, explore, do missions And so on singleplayer has many storylines and sad/interesting lores behind it backing up both singleplayer and GTA 5. GTA 5 would honestly be a good game if it wasn't for the horrendous amounts of cheaters inside of every single online server. The game itself is a good game, emersive and open world. It sucks how it's filled with cheaters and people who'll kill you instantly after joining servers. I one time had to reinstall GTA 5 twice because one cheater crashed my game entirely. Multi-million dollar company? Come on now. I'm not saying there shouldn't be glitches or cheaters. They're always will be. I'm just shocked by the fact that a multi-million dollar company has this much cheaters. The game itself would get a 4.5/5 if it wasn't for how quick and easy you'd get bored without friends or missions entirely. I tried a quick time lapse to see how long it would take for me to get bored doing missions and one of me messing around. Doing missions got a 4 hour mark while doing nothing has gotten a 30 minute mark. I get the argument I'm making above is stupid but it should be common sense for a user who has nothing to do and doesn't want to do missions waste time in something fun. This game gets a 3/10. Many cheaters. And can only play with people with the same console as yours which is pretty stupid but it's fine. As someone with no friends online is shit, fivem is boring and the game is only fun with missions"
i lopve this game
"It's an okay installment of GTA, though nothing like San Andreas.  But it's GTA Online that is the real dumpster fire.  It's an infuriating game to play and  nearly impossible to do without spending money, which is obviously the point.  Totally ruined Rockstar's reputation in my opinion.  A complete money grab, the load times are terrible, and impossible to enjoy.  Absolute trash."
Play this game to get hyped for GTA VI

BEST GAME EVER IF YOU LIKE TO RP
i like the graphics of this game its just mindblowing
Only funny.
"YES!! i would recommend to all player's and gamer's, thumbs up for me, i been playing it back in the 2013 when it came out, 10 years on it, took a 4 year brake now i'm back on it again making up the lost year's of playing (GTA V Online) awesome!!"
its rlly fun with other ppl and friends
no i wouldnt recommend this game
The best in the series so far
This game is cancer and full of cheaters!!
"Love the game, hate that they ignore the PC Gamers."
"Classic in every sense of the word !       Way to many greifers and modders on PC for online GTA V but, it is what it is !!"

"This game allows cheaters to magically teleport you to their location so they can kill you. So much fun! SHIT game, Shitty developers to allow this kind of thing. DO NOT BUY at any price!."

"Fantastic entry in a long running series. Play the story, play online with a few friends, whatever. Any time spent with GTAV is a good time. Performance should be solid across a variety of hardware at this point. Only negatives would be the online monetization which can dictate the quality of the experience. GTAV is worth picking up on a sale if nothing else for the single player alone. You should get quite a bit of time out of it."
"this game just scamed the fuck out of me i had a good ass thing with 500 mill and that shit is just gone          "" i put a bomb in the head quarters"""
"I told myself i wouldn't write a review of GTA5 until GTA 6 release date was announced, so here i am... its ok.... Franklin was the only character i cared about. Micheal was an old boring dad and Trevor was just.... lets just say i only played him when i had to to continue the main story line. GTA4 was the best of all GTA games IMO."
best game ever. period
GTA VI IS REAL BABY!  I will be 25 when it comes out...  Maybe.
You NEED a rockstar acont to play
"fun is temporary, grind is eternal"
"Grand Theft Auto V is a triumph of game design, storytelling, and technical achievement. It has set a new standard for open-world gaming, providing an immersive and endlessly entertaining experience"
"can't wait for GTA VI (ps: shout out for everyone that saw the trailer before it got over 50K views, we will go down in history for that)"
Heres to hoping GTA VI Lives up to this after the trailer 🙏🙏
da club (:
"ive been playing gta 5 since xbox 360 release. the fond memories ive made with friends ive made through out the years. the many hours ive spent on this game and have been through every update for it. now with the release of gta 6 coming in years im assuming (and its trailer that just dropped now), id like too say thank you rockstar for making my youth a great time."
gta vi is coming out guys you can forget about this game
pee pee
this game is soooooo realistic and so fun!!!!!!!

better graphics still same old game release gta 6
"Gta V is the best version after san andreas, now we have to see what Rockstar unveils in the next version? Will it change the game world again or not?"
"bugs, freezes and crashes. Also horrible community and a lot of cheaters."
good game steven ogg good
sach a good game itz fantastick but the bugs should be fixed
"The single player is one of the best pieces of entertainment that I have ever had the pleasure to consume. It is a big world with lots of fun missions to do, main and side quests alike. Do not purchase this game, if you plan on solely playing the online portion of it. GTA Online is a terrible mess of bs. The developer does not have the slightest idea of balancing, online security and economy in an online game.  TL;DR: Buy buy buy for story, stay away from online."
"very cool game i recommend,also relxing"
It's not just a game. It's a world within a world.
GTA6 announced tomorrow who's with me?! :D

ive been only playing story mode and its great until i joined gta online
"Hello, could I ask where I can buy the vehicles that you have removed ? For example, Roosevelt Porche from Bennys Shop or cars from GTA, characters from Trevor and his Rebel Michael and his Audi and Franklin and his Buffalo 2 ? thanks ☻"
Pretty good but took a while to get to work properly. Not a console experience ofc!
"Game is asking me for CD Key activation even though it's already attached to my account. Can't play my game anymore simply because Rockstar decided so. -Edit: Got it working from uninstalling everything, including social club and manually deleting each folder left. R* Support won't help you, they're a bunch of monkeys with wrenches."
Deff on of my fav games of all time
amazing game in all aspects been playing this game for 10 years now and never disappointed frfr
"You forget a 1000 things everyday, make sure this is one of them."

"single player is good, but the multiplayer is only good with friends and even then with all the hackers and trolls its impossible to get anything done.  if you plan on playing online by yourself, be prepared for hackers and rocket spamming tards blowing people up cus they dont have anything better in there life so they try to make yours just as shit.  progression ain't bad as long as you can actually get things done, but again dealing with hackers and trills makes that almost impossible"
fist time 1 week game 100% working but 8 day game is very lag my laptop 8gb ram 1 tb storge lag probelm
nice game #100

It's the best game of all time.

Very graphic game. You have freedom to do things you'd never think of doing.
"this game is so fun, the only thing bad about this is pvp. i recommend you try this"
"A 10/10 to me, online gets stale after grinding a bunch but the story is still top tier"
"No matter how many words I use to describe this game, it won't be enough. So let me just put it in one word for our convenience. AWESOME it is."
This game may be old but its one of my childhood favorites so i do suggest playing
i like milk
The dog is gay
good game👍
Best GTA to date. Can't wait for the new GTA6 trailer to be released in a couple of days.
The game is realistic and intresring but in online there are some hackers the rockstar must find an solution for the hackers
modders are nice to me because i ask them
"i've spent alot more time playing console than pc as i only have this version because of my pc friends, despite the fact that this game has made me a vengful and hateful sonofabeach i still love this game to pieces. my only gripe with this game is the no lifes that just want to see the world of others burn for some sort of amusement in their pathetic and sad lives.  that is why the power of friendship is a thing lads.  9/10"
Hours speak for itself.  One of the Greatest Games of all time.  -skye
i recomended for  upper than 18 years

Its GTA V man what else I need to say
its tittie fun
good cors do big drive
Incredible game
"Great game story line is almost perfect and fun. Completed in about 66hr, or less i did a lot of random stuff like online not just the missions back to back. Honestly you could probably knock this game out in 2 or 3 weekends if you wanted to. I don't have any extra stuff just the game the over all game play was great the bots weren't to hard to kill. Police were fairly balanced if you wanted to fight them you could but it was just as easy to hide. But my main complaint would be the ending of the story mode i feel like they could have made it more harder to kill the leaders or at least made killing them each having a separate mission. They Likely could have gotten an extra 20 minutes or so out of it I just feel like with the base game theirs some thing that should have been added. It just feels like you were riled up for a bit finish with 3 big fights and it didn't happen. But I would still play and don't regret buying."
"This is one of the BEST games to come out of all-time. The story and online gameplay still hold up to this day, though cheaters in most online servers. I don't know what else to say, I just like Grand Theft Auto."
Modders and hackers have ruined this game. Toxic gaming culture
GTA innit
"The ability to play any Rockstar games I purchased on Steam has been stripped away just as it has for many other people due to the ridiculous social club requirement attached.  Below is the support ticket. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3103521022  You have a single account (for a launcher!?), anything happens to it and Rockstar deems you not the owner despite obvious evidence, that’s it. Your games are now rendered unusable. The compromised account permanently tied to Steam with no option to unlink. The only option being to repurchase all Rockstar games once again somewhere else if you fancy playing them again (remind me why Rockstar have any incentive to adjust social clubs current implementation).  In GTA 4’s instance, it didn’t even have social club when I purchased. Rockstar added it in an update in 2020 (The same update which also removed content from the game due to licence expiry). In what way does the EULA or any other measure give the right to REMOVE no longer licenced content from copies purchased previous? Say you own a film on DVD / BluRay, it has a wicked car chase scene. Later down the line, the movie company loses the licence from the car manufacturer of one of the cars in the scene. Can the movie company then come and take away your film and hand you another copy with the car removed from the chase scene?"

"Been playing GTA since it was top view, favorite game franchise ever."
dO I Really need to leave a review?   Buy it and do some crimes!!! Oh can i call you criminal scum?
"The online mode really wants you to spend money. Also the movement mechanics kinda suck. Messing around in the open world is pretty fun, but I find just cause 2s open world to be just a bit better As for the campaign. I really liked it however it really feels like some of the missions are just trying to waste your time. It has an amazing pay off but it feels really stretched out. then again maybe i should've just been fast traveling with the taxi."
Refund can not play the game at all
old game it's boring
Cool woo game
"Hearing about GTA6 I reloaded GTA5. Man, the controls for first person are trash. I remember now why I didn't play this on PC. Fingers crossed GTA6 is better."
best game ever made could play it for days straight <3
GOOD GAME BAD SERVICES

"The only weak part of this game is the quality of the story, other than that the game is amazing."
its fun tbh
"Good single, horrible online"
I liked everything about it ..!!
the fact you need the rockstar launcher after buying on steam is a joke.
"Great game, I couldn't stop playing after starting"
"i mean its GTA, speaks for itself really :D"

Pretty good game
"It's a fun game. I like it. Both story and online are super fun. Great to play with friends, and great game to unwind with."
GTA V doesn't let me rob or kill the drug dealers.
awesomegame
"When I play this game its like being in the city with them... Graphics are awesome... I get close with the characters just like I'm part of the group... Lots to do but maybe not enough in Story Mode... I really can't wait for the next GTA, I hope its at least as good or better and has a longer Story Mode... Online Mode is great too but too many people who can't play without cheats... I guess some just can't handle getting their butts kicked!... LOL..."

"Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece in the gaming world. From its stunningly detailed open-world environment to its gripping story line, this game sets a new standard for immersive gaming experiences. The level of detail in Los Santos is mind-blowing, making it feel like a living, breathing city ripe for exploration.  The game's narrative is incredibly engaging, weaving together the lives of three distinct protagonists, each with their own compelling story lines and personalities. The seamless switching between characters adds depth and variety to game play, keeping things fresh and exciting."
"Why did I move here? I guess it was the weather. Or the... Ah, I don't know, that thing. That magic"

just played for gta 6
fun game i recommend
"After 2200 hours of playing GTA Online, I can say this game is very timeless; no matter how old this game is, people will comeback and still play GTA Online. One key reason is that this game doesn't require a high-end gaming PC, so literally everyone can still play GTA online without any performance issues.  But, always remember that modders are still and always been an issue in this game, so I wouldn't recommend playing it on the public lobby; it would be better to play in an invite-only session or a friends session."
"GTA 5 is one of the greatest game Rockstar has ever made, everything about this game is just too amazing the dialogues, mechanics, weapons, action, missions, story and obviously the supercars. I Love it all <3"
"My friend who I play CS 2 with said if I post a review on GTA 5, and it gets 75 likes and 30 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 3060 and 1 Kilo of Lemon . So im just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha"

"Great game. Could use more single player content, but with the GTA 6 trailer right around the corner as I'm typing this, that's highly unlikely."
very good game witth mods  (im lying)
I like gta5
dfsdfsdfdfd
This game is very fun; The story is amazing. I love going online and making money. It was hard at first but it's all worth it.
awesome roleplay on 5m servers
great game don't buy though. wait because gta6 will come out 2024
itz really fun and coolz :D
"i LOVE the GTA Franchise, its been ""Top Three"" Favorite games ... From the Birds eye View in the First, to all the Liberty Story's ....Top three Favorite games GTA, NFS and Burnout... The only reason why GTA is contending with a threes way tie is due to the fact that there are too many Modders and CHEATERS on the online servers. if there were no modders GTA would be #1... Still play GTA the most out of all my games :)"

"15 years... 2 AAA games... and you still can't figure out your unstable server situation.  Completing heists, races, or missions in Online mode are next to impossible. Making me second guess whether or not I'll even bother to buy GTA6.  Stop focusing on your Shark Cards, and your bloated content, and fix your f**king servers. Fix San Andreas while your at it."
this game is the best
"m,nn n"
One of the best games of all time cant wait for gta 6 game is pretty money hungry though. 4/5
I wish I could figure out what's wrong with the heads of all the people who supposedly love this game (bunch of masochists probably).  four different times on four different pc's the rockstar app just freezes when trying to load the game and i cannot get into the game.  I have never had a full chance to actually enjoy the game because of this pointless app.  Whoever the creator of this app is should be publicly hanged... i own the game and cannot play it... It's too late to get money back and I'm sickened with it.  I deal with the same thing with RDR2 as well.  I'm done with Rockstar. Fuck em...  I shouldn't need your app if I don't play online either.  I'm super thankful CDPR dropped the next GTA and they call it cyberpunk.  because this has been a sickening show by rockstar.
this game is crazy guys you  have to try it out
me luv dis game lol

This is a great game for any average player! You can be good or bad. Though bad is so good! You are encouraged to be an outlaw in this game. Being a good person won't get you very far in this action packed game. You gotta be willing to step on the little man to go places in Los Santos. Take 'em for all they got!!!
nice and good

"Story mode is just unsatisfying, you don't even get to make your own character for it and are forced to swap between multiple characters. Online mode is pointless unless you want to just get killed repeatedly by people who can't enjoy themselves without ensuring other people aren't enjoying themselves. Overall the game is just disappointing."
"Filled to the brim with hackers, impossible to grind.   11/10."
It is GTAV of course it is great!

very very guten game

still recommending after 10 yrs except the fact that there are still hackers
Fuck you rockstar social club
BESTEST GAME
just a bunch of players hacking and fucking with you the whole time
"I love Take 2 and all the Gta games overall, GTA V has a special place due to the whole modding community as well as the RP content that came out of it. Speedruns to absolutely juicing out the game for every $. This was too much fun to play. Hoping GTA VI brings more joy."
Very Good Game other than the toxic online players
خیلیم عالی
"An absolutely amazing game, the graphics are off the chart. I love the story mode, you get right into the action. This game has had me hooked for days. I would strongly recommend this game to whoever likes open world, heists, robbery and cars. Well worth my money!"
my wife gonna get me GTA VI if i can get 1000 like and 20 awards on this review!!! HELP A BROTHER OUT!!!

Excellent game.
byh
I mean it's alright although I got ban because money cheat ;)
gta v game is best game
the best rockstargames ever
The best game i have played will replay this worth the money! <3 love this game
I do recommend the game for the story mode (if you have not played it before) but if you are trying to get the game for the online mode. Dont. there are way to many modders and they will eventually just get you banned and you wont be able to have fun at all.
very goood very nice
took my soul and other bunch of souls to complete criminal master mind and all i get is some digital achievement. thanks indeed! 🥴good game 1 achievement is impossible to get. touch some grass
it kept on lagging and freezing plese fix it
Best Game Everrr I had Play

"There's so many people botting, modding AND hacking that it's lost all fun."
its fun  esp w mods
"GTA V is a very good game.However GTA online has a lot of bugs in 2023 , it crashes every time I play. Perhaps such issues should be looked into"
"i loved when Lester said ""it is Lesting time"" after they finished the doomsday heist and Mo' Lested all over the place!!! Peak of gayming for me !!!"
Very good game but not new player friendly
"GTA6 Trailer one is coming lady's and germs! Get ready to break up with your girlfriend,Quit your job and stock your gamer den with snacks when the final trailer pops and pre orders start. It's gonna be a new pandemic work from home situation for alot of us! See you on the tarmac in Miami."
"I can relieveing my stress by playing as mikey, trevor or franklin."
"I don't really know how to review this game, the base game is still pretty solid, but gta online is pretty crap.  It seems like they've removed the ability to just purchase the base game from steam, so you've gotta get both the base game and criminal enterprise starter pack (it's the same price on their own store).  The single-player story is fairly decent, and the gameplay is fun enough, though it feels a little empty in side content.  While I've had quite a lot of fun with online it's only really because I've only really played it with friends in private lobbies, and as such I've avoided most if the BS that the online community has to offer, that does not excuse how horrendously grindy the online is, and it's only gotten worse over time.  Also, they force you to use their own launcher which is always bad, it'd be fine if it was an option or at least worked well, but it really doesn't."
woow
awesome story
Ultimately the best experience you can get before Grand Theft Auto 6 arrives.
POOP
good game and easy reached level 8000 in a day!
i like the game very much because its my dream game also it would so many player's dre

"Only the single player, not the online. Actually, it's best if you don't buy this game at all and play IV, it's genetically superior."
this game is hella fun with mods so much to do love the story mode
I beat the vault just to get disconnected before my money  edit: best game ever lessgo good game 10 outta 10

"what a bloody amazing game highly recommended, great graphics, amazing lore, fun yet interesting gameplay and story. absolutely brilliant. My favourite part of the story is in the jewellery store heist when Micheal says ""you forget a thousand things every day. how about you make sure this is one on them"" and rides off like a pro. What an insane game, rockstar... thank you for making such great games, cant wait to see GTA VI"
Game very fun.    Yea that's it
I was able to play it 10 years after it was released and it was worth the wait
"once again like they did in 2013, rockstar have screwed over the gta 5 pc fanbase, from now on the next lot of gta online updates rae only going to the xbox and ps5, we are getting nothing, first we are forced to wait a year now this, like xbox and ps5 have better specs then us, what rubbish, the game is dead already"
Online Mode give me PTSD
goioody gem
multi billion dollar company.. cant afford anti-cheat software
Good game for open world experiences but online there are greifers left and right.
just wanted to leave a bad review for the fact that i got banned for not playing the game.

Great game as always fro Rockstar my favorite was GTAIV but 5 was great as well. Lets hope 6 knocks it outta the park

"Grand theft is just a cash grab game. The story is alright but any online interaction is ruined by 70% people hacking and rockstar has never moderated their servers so if you try to do anything legit you are either targeted by the hackers or pay to win people. Unless you want to spend hundreds of hours of being griefed to get a single good car, don't buy. If you want to play online it is borderline impossible without running into people with infinite health, teleporters, or just god like abilities. This is suppose to be a crime game and its just a place hackers can go without worrying about a ban or kick."
UGGGGGGGN
fine
This game taught me how to read!
Got it on sale to play the story and man i don't remember the story being relatively short but i enjoyed it and if ur gonna play online definitely worth it
This game is for morons
"PC was, is, and always be the next-gen."
I don't think I have to say much about the game. It is the best.
this game is fun and im still thimking bc its been out for 10 years
best game in the world
garbage ahh gaame
"Great game. Thumbs down for the ""current gen"" console advantages in GTA Online like HWS upgrades. What a shame. And the ridiculous amount of hackers... you can't be serious tolerating that for years."
Too much freemason symbolism in this game. It gets old fast
its best game ever
awesome game waiting for gta vi
мда
its tooo good
good but no much
narly
best game i have ever played
best game in old and next generation

"the game is so good, i couldn't stop playing and almost died because i never ate, slept, or drank."
best in every aspect
"Stellar gameplay, great story in the single player, and the online multiplayer is really fun when you play with friends. All-around a great game."
VERY AMAZING GAME I LIKE IT
"really fun, whether you play solo or co-op so many of the places in the game actually exist irl, while having their own twist many different interactive options, whether it's combat, driving, or even flying really fun to play with friends, and you can even buy your own cars and houses has mature content, but recommended"
racing is amazing
ge te ay is cole becuz it has guns and cops and robers and cars

"I love gta. Every game across the gta timelines. Story mode is great, but was abandoned for the profit incoming from gtao. But now? I have to buy a trash ass playstation or xbox to even see animals? why don't we get gta+?  I suffer through modders every day, to grind and have fun, just to know i'm not getting a whole car club? This is next gen, why is it so hard? Every day its just more disappointment. I thought Rockstar was redeeming itself. I was wrong."
"Main reason why I wanted a gaming PC... still kept playing TF2 before and after getting one, but still."
"good, too much hackers tbh"
This game is for people like me if you know what I mean and no one else.
"In terms of story, it's amazing"
Love this game!! Best open world game ever!!
yoooooooooooooooeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee nihyhhga

i love it and hate it equally

GTA V came out while I was just a silly kid in 6th grade.I was scrolling youtube when I saw a gameplay for it and god it was perfect. I was young but I had played all the GTA franchises up until GTA 4.I wanted it so badly but I did not have a console or a PC that could run it.10 years later I was able to afford a gaming pc and boy the first to do after booting my pc was to download GTA V the cheer happened the joy I was a kid again at 21. I watched 10s of games for the entire game but it felt like it was the first time I have ever played it. Today I completed the game and smiled like a my silly 6th grade self did.
violence is never the answer but it is the way

"played on Xbox for years and decided to get on computer, slightly sad about no cross progression but is a great game 9/10"
"it was once a good game, but, wayy too milked, online is practically unplayable, if you're new, either given money from a modded, or just stuck on a constant grind.   Modding killed the game imo but its been dead forever, just work on a new game.."
"Grand Theft Auto is a masterpiece of a series, and number V is arguably the best one, perhaps being the most fun you can have with your clothes on... Or off maybe?"
"All micro transactions, if they cared about the population they would let you transfer from console to PC. But its a money grab, just spend more $$$. Story is fun if you haven't played it but stay far away from online w/ the death by micro transactions, pay to win."
not getting animals update on pc
"✔ GTA V is the best selling game in the world and it's no wonder it offers the content it does.  I had a lot of fun playing GTA V, both with my friends and by myself.  Most of the time I played online, so I can't evaluate the singleplayer from my own experience, which I only have a peek at on the YouTube platform.  The most interesting game for me.  ❌ Online, it would like more content, something more entertaining.  After a few hours there is nothing to do online.  Few real-world aspects included."

I regret to my self why I started late this master piece
"Great story, fun side quests and amazing map to explore."

"The best game fr, the graphics the open world, and the best part GTA ONLINE infinite activities .. SO FUN , MUST TRY IN MY OPINION"
"Still so many modders you sometimes have to restart the game 4xs just to join a server and play. then when you do find a server where a modder doesnt kick you from game, theres modders killing you while in passive mode. Rockstar really let this game go to s@!t"
i love tes game

Pretty sick with mods but good game with or without.

"Story is very fun. Online [i]was[/i] very fun, now it is unplayable due to modders. Every public session is either filled with chaos and griefers or you get booted off the lobby by some modder. I hope Rockstar improves the online experience in the next game.  I recommend the game for single player, but not the online gameplay."
I love going to the shoe shop!

Ruined by Chinese players.
story fun but online is havoc hahahaha
i can not get to play this game from i buy this game it has not start
funny shooty
hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahah fish
options for online to play with friends is limited i always say rock-star should focus on GTA online more than story one i hope GTA 6 have more options to play with friends some like more hair models neon tattoos ( couple options ) events  more mystery that we discover with friends and .... that Im sure rock star knows better all they just do is they give more attention to online instead of story mode
what have they done to online? campaign is ok 7/10 (ps: Diamond > Cayo)
fuck this game is absolutelyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy cringe
fun you can be free
Play story mode if you haven't I love it much more than online

best game I am playing to everyday I am enjoyed to everyday I am playing to my friend is very good game

This game is one of my favorites. The story alone is a piece of art and had me hooked from day one. I do recommend playing invite only or closed friend sessions in GTA online as there are so many people who will grief you
good job
amazing..................................................................
the greatest game ever made.
"as someone whos highly addicted to the online of this game please take these things into consideration before buying this is not an easy game other players are not going to help you for nothing, It is essential you offer others help in hopes of making friends so that way you can help each other, With that said some player will scam you and lie to you at the end of the day its every man for themselves. Either learn how to survive or learn how suck **** cause you aint getting any hand outs ;-0"
"502 Bad gateway, very cool. I bought this game years ago only for it to require me to log in to play singleplayer. Y'all thought Starfield was bad? Just wait until GTA 6 comes out with a single player battle pass. Fuck you Cockstar."

"Oh my stars and pixelated heavens! GTA 5 is not just a game, it's a euphoric rollercoaster of digital delight that catapults you into a neon-soaked wonderland of crime and chaos! From the adrenaline-pumping heists that make your heart race faster than a turbocharged sports car to the sprawling cityscape that sparkles like a million digital diamonds, GTA 5 is an absolute triumph of gaming brilliance. The characters are more charismatic than a puppy in a bowtie, the storyline is more gripping than a grandma's secret cookie recipe, and the open-world exploration is as liberating as a unicorn on a trampoline. It's a joyous explosion of pixels and possibilities that will leave you grinning like a Cheshire cat who just discovered the cheat codes to happiness. In the world of video games, GTA 5 isn't just a game; it's a virtual symphony of euphoria that'll have you dancing in your gaming chair with glee! If joy had a joystick, it would be GTA 5!"
*Click* Noice! (*-*)
goood game

"This game is one of the best time killers, on top of that there's so much to do. I highly recommend this game for those whom like free roam games!"
It's just full of modders that make it impossible for you to grind. Also Rockstar is just a greedy money pit that doesn't listen to it's audience
great open world game:)
Great game but MAKE GTA VI ALREADY
IMBA🦣
Overall game is still late 2023 very great and fun to play. I recommend this game those who like to play openworld games.
I used to dumpster dive at game stops. I sold them back the controllers they threw out and that's how I preordered GTA5 in highschool
u can drive over people
It is a realy fun game to play with friends but there is alot of heckers :D
i pressed the yes button 10 times
This game SUCKS ever wanted to get a good car maybe a couple how about u grind for 10 hours eh? and while ur doing that you have these people that are kiling u for no reason and u cant kill them why? their modding and rockstar wont do anything also this game still has several bugs but they only patch the ones that could give u 1k more than what ur apost to get from a hiest if you really like to pull the hair from ur scalp daily play this game
"I have played 2 Grand Theft Auto Games (GTA V and GTA IV) and both Red Dead Redemption Games. I have to say this game is beautiful after 10 Years, Mods are Fun on Story, FiveM is very fun, downside is that Rockstar Games has done nothing about Toxic Players and Hackers on the PC who ruin the fun, if you can get past that, the online is good without them. If you are a person who plays GTA V on Console and you recently got a PC, you should definitely get Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC. Lets hope GTA VI tops this and GTA IV. I'd give the game a Solid 9/10."

very fun and cool :0

i hate this game
"Works w/o any tweaks using Proton Experimental on Linux.  The Rockstar launcher will ask for a CD Key which can be found on Steam within one of the the settings menus after purchase.  Even at 10 years old still worth picking up, especially on sale in the $10-20 range"
"Story the game is actually fun playing. Online its a joke the game is only fun online if your playing in private with friends. Outside of playing in private, almost every public game has a modder cheating harassing other online players. When it comes to reporting them rockstar does nothing about this even though they say they do not support modding like that (some modding is ok) Other then that you have to keep rejoining games and pray you dont have a player in game harassing people. For the money we pay for these games rockstar should be controlling this and provide alot better support then they are currently."

mac n cheese

"Grand Theft Auto Online has rampant hacking/modding issues, which Rockstar has done little to address. This includes, among other things, the ability for ""modders"" to tamper with and ban your online account, crash the game outright, obtain your IP address, and even maliciously modify files and execute code on your PC (the latter making the game malware). See the National Vulnerability Database report (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24059), which rates it 7.3 (high severity) and states, ""Grand Theft Auto V for PC allows attackers to achieve partial remote code execution or modify files on a PC, as exploited in the wild in January 2023.""   Rockstar's cyber security practices are laughable. They are aware of the exploits but simply do not care. Be aware that you are essentially downloading malware by purchasing this game and playing online. This game should be taken down until these issues are fully addressed. Feel free to copy the above if you choose to report the game on Steam as I have."
"Its a good game, my rock star games account got hacked so i cant play it anymore"
how do you beat the train in prologue please help i wanna play online
Got killed by a kid with a fully upgraded Oppressor MK.II multiple times when I started playing the game. I enjoy the heists though. Very much money to be gained.
Liked gameplay
this game so cool
"gta 6 es un mito, no le crean a nadie"
great game has tons of fun!
combo with five M and u will feel other taste
you can kill single mothers on the street
"Thought it was a fun little time waster, didn't spend too much time into it, gonna be playing more tho"
The Online mode is what makes this still fun
discord.gg/deltagta
GOOD WITH MODS
One of the best stories ever. 10 years since release and I still love it.
yes gta v good
"Античит топ, бабки можно накрутить через Cheat Engine, даже не надо покупать ПО у других читаков."
the gta V is soooo gooooood i reccomend ittttt
Story mode is pretty good but don't buy if you're planning to play online. It's completely full of hackers that will ruin your experience.
"Every single online match is just full of hackers. There's 0 point to online play in public. Given this games age one would expect a better suite of moderation and reporting tools, but that definitely is lacking as the rampant cheating never ceases"
"Shark Cards go ""Give me your fucking money"""
i've played for 1065 hours and i play it almost everyday and i really recommend this game but in online there are a lot of griefers that are higher level then me (my level is 86-87) but the story mode is amazing Trevor is pure insanity Michael is that one crazy dad and Franklin is just a chill dude so i really love this game and dax in online is more like Trevor then anything PURE INSANITY i really enjoy this game and you will too (maybe)
This game has very good graphics
Story is awesome. Multiplayer too predatory with micro-transactions and full of hackers in free roam to be worth playing.

"Bought for the Steam Deck, only to forget you need a constant internet connection. So I bought it for free somewhere else.   Food for thought, if your anti-piracy trash doesn't stop pirates and makes people want to after already buying the game, maybe don't have one."
i like how yall play in gta 5
i like to kill other players :) very fun 10/10
GTA 5 is kaef kto kupil tot pupsik
I love killing civilians. Great practice for drunk driving! Great teaching game! Learned how to become an assassin for a meth dealer on GTA and now I make millions as a hitman for a meth kingpin IRL! BIG MONEY MOVES PEOPLE. GET YOUR KIDS ON GTA 5 ASAP! 10/10 would recommend. Online has too many hackers (boo). but if you play in a private lobby bing chilling.
i love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
discount - BUY!
The best game ever made.
fuck this stupid dumbass game THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MODDER GRIEFERS AND THEY DONT GET BANNED AND OFC WHEN I FUCKING CRASHED A CHEATER I GET SLAPPED WITH A FUCKING BAN. WHY NIGGA? (i also made a bit money but thats not it) FUCK U ROCKSTAR AND YOUR BITCH ASS ANTI CHEAT
pepole kell die

"I heard a lot about this game, and it truly is a masterpiece. the game is awesome, and the community even so. i preferrably play online, as its a lot of fun. in my opinion, the campaign is also very enjoyable, even tho i only played an hour of it. i advise you buy a premium bundle, as it includes so much for that price. if i were you, i would buy it when its on sale. gta gets discounted a lot, so you dont have to wait a lot. i hope you enjoy the game as much as i do."
hehehe
this game is crazy best
Finally my dream came true now I'm playing GTA V
Very good for 2015 game!

Good and fun with freinds
"i bought this game for benchmarking on old laptop, refund it because the laptop isnt powerful enough and grab the one on epic since i have a pc now (this is irrelevant)  and honestly, the game still holds up even after 10 years, visually and gameplay-wise, performed better as well than most games. 8/10, just dont bother with the online mode"
dont recomend because it is very short game and i litrally complited this game in 23hours and now i am bored.
its good has a good storyline
This Game Good
Super fun and the mods carry the game
v.v
"that game is good for LSPDFR mod, I am want ford crown vic/p71 but at Indonesia dis car not available, now I modded GTA V for dis"
"Stupid social club, my email has been hacked and changed so now i bought the game but i cant play because my steam has unlinked to that email, i wrote ticket but they didnt solve my problem"
"Some guy was dropping money and calling people racial slurs, pretty cool game."
very good other than hardcore sweats
"Played this game through various platforms. Started with ps3, moved to ps4, and then eventually wound up here on PC. Initially when I played this game way back when, it was still frustrating as all hell, but at some level playable. Online was very lacking and tedious, but it kept adding content every now and then. The apartments with ten car garages were the last thing I saw before taking a decade long break from this game. I eventually got it again while it was on sale and came bundled with a ten mil package for online. Cool, I thought, maybe this would help me catch up to what I missed after all these years. .... And today I'm officially rage quitting this nightmare hell hole of a game. I don't even want to touch single player at this point with how bad online has gotten. It may have lacked content back in the day, but now it is just an unbalanced nightmare of a mess. I've never seen the game cheat its way to victory the way I see constantly now. It's like it has a mind of its own and just knows how to irritate the ever living hell out of you. When you combine that factor with the onslaught of modders, it's just unplayable. Whats the point of online if you constantly have to go into a private session? How am I supposed to find friends to play with when everyone is running from the main lobby? My first play was fine, it even seemed better than what I saw on console; but it only took two to three days to see this nonstop pattern. The game itself is alright if you consider the single player aspect of it and how old it is. By all means, get it for that and do whatever. But online? Online just sucks. I don't know when they decided to do it, but the developers have made this game so freaking hard at this point that it's just not enjoyable. Maybe the vets of the game have no idea because they've adjusted to it, but if you haven't played in a long time, it is just not a friendly game at all and doesn't get any better with time. I can't tell you how many times I've been instantly killed with full armor and health, or had a helicopter spawn into mine just to kill me, but it's been enough. I'm done. I'm just done with this nonsense. Headshots hardly ever count anymore and I've literally seen NPCs actually die and then just stand back up and proceed to murder me. No matter how far away I am and at what ever angle, they always hit me. Maybe one shot misses, maybe. Meanwhile I see my shots go straight through them over and over again. The list goes on with this game. We all know what this game does to piss us all off, but now it's just ten times worse than it ever was. Not to mention the fact that I had a modder randomly appear next to me and suddenly my character level went from ten to 100 just like that. Online was never all that great to begin with, but now it is just horrible. I'm tired of getting pissed off whenever I play this game, so I'm done. Most of you are probably much more level headed than I am, so you'll probably be fine. But if you easily get frustrated like I do, then you may find yourself in the same boat as I am. Single player is same as it always was, but online is just a joke now.  P.S. Dear rockstar, when in the hell are you ever going to make these controls actually good? Maybe spend a little more time in that department. I'm not the only one blowing a gasket every time I try to go through a doorway or something similar. More than five games now and my character still feels like a crazed monkey with cement shoes that gains too little or too much momentum. Also, watching my character stand in place every time they open a safe in the nightclub was enough for me to blow a fuse too. EVERY TIME! Every damn one of your games has something like this and in more than one spot. Good God, it's a game. Lets get on with it! I'm dying of old age while my character is waiting for a repetitive task to get started."
This game is fun! i enjoy it a lot! Just a ton of Hackers which i dont enjoy. End of discussion. Perchance.
It's gta 5
one of the best games to play with friends
it is hecka fun
"When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust nobody, least of all each other."

"GTA V is 8 years old game and it has extremely high population of players . You can never be bored of this game,  i did  try online and i didnt play too long , from the videos i have seen on YT, GTA Online has influx of cheaters, people say if devs. can do something about cheating, game will be more enjoyable to play. Everyone  from age 7 to age 77  knows about GTA 5 . Im just here to add my positive comment and some negative . :)"
I played it
must buy real good
this game is great
It's just a great game. Can't wait until GTA 6 arrives.
when i play this game online it feels like i am playing pve that is ment for a full squad but i am playing solo.

Fun game if you learn how to play. But the community is somewhat toxic.
"Don't hate me cause I'm beautiful. Maybe if you got rid of that old yee - yee ass haircut, you'd get some bitches on yo dick. Oh, better yet, maybe Tanisha'll call your dog ass if she stops fuckin' with that brain surgeon or lawyer she fucking with."

"The base game’s story is pretty good even if the multiplayer was hard to get into, but the LSPDFR mod was what really enhanced the game’s replayability."

"I have witness this buggy game becoming more and more buggy. I thought I will get used to it eventually like a ""boiling frog"", but I was wrong. I eventually can not bear it anymore today, right on the Thanksgiving day. The disgusting bugs in this game finally devours all of my thanks to all the time with this game.  So, I will not give any thanks nor likes to this goddaamn buggy game which incite players attacking each other. If GTA VI is also buggy like this, I will definitely spread pirated for revenge on the clumsy game developers."
"yes released since 10 years ago , still unbeatable in graphics"
"Grand Theft Auto V, upon its initial release, set an unprecedented standard for open-world gaming that left an indelible mark on the industry. Rockstar's masterpiece, with its sprawling world, complex characters, and engaging narrative, was the pinnacle of gaming innovation at the time.  The vast and meticulously crafted city of Los Santos, coupled with the seamless transition between the three diverse protagonists, showcased a level of detail and immersion that was revolutionary. The heist missions, in particular, demonstrated Rockstar's ability to blend narrative and gameplay, setting a new bar for what could be achieved in the realm of interactive storytelling.  Graphically, GTA 5 was a marvel, pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible on the then-current generation of gaming consoles. The attention to detail, from the bustling city streets to the sun-soaked landscapes, was unparalleled and contributed to the game's lasting visual appeal.  However, as the years have passed, GTA 5's continued dominance in the gaming landscape feels both a testament to its enduring popularity and a double-edged sword. While the game's initial release undoubtedly deserves its status as a classic, the decision to keep it in circulation across multiple console generations begins to show signs of fatigue.  The game's mechanics, while solid, have started to show their age compared to more recent releases. The multiplayer component, GTA Online, while immensely successful and enjoyable for many, has also faced issues with rampant in-game inflation and a reliance on microtransactions that can hinder the experience for those who prefer a more traditional progression system.  Despite its flaws, GTA 5 still manages to captivate new audiences and entertain loyal fans. Rockstar's commitment to supporting the game with updates and new content is commendable. However, one can't help but wonder if the time has come for the gaming industry to look beyond the enduring shadow of GTA 5 and embrace the next wave of groundbreaking titles that push the boundaries even further.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains a landmark title that undeniably shaped the gaming landscape upon its release. While its continued presence is a testament to its enduring appeal, there's a sense that the gaming community, as well as Rockstar themselves, might benefit from turning their focus toward new horizons and fresh innovations rather than relying on the laurels of a classic that's been in circulation for perhaps a bit too long."
If you like seeing how long you can full-throttle a motorcycle through oncoming highway traffic this game is for you.
niceeeee
I LIKE THIS GAME I PLAY 6 YEAR LATER.

condoms
It's GTA!
fucking gmae
this is gta. no one can say it`s bad game
Best game ever played an awesome graphics
I love niggers in this game :3
For the most part I love this game. It's so fun to just drive around and mess with NPCs. The quests are fun. I don't like the super long loading screen when you launch anything. Multiplayer is just full of hackers and people that blow you up. Story is great.

"""Grand Theft Auto V: Where I Learn Crime Pays, But My Driving Skills Sure Don't"" Howdy, carjackers and aspiring criminals! I recently dove into the wild, crime-infested world of Grand Theft Auto V, and let me tell you, my real-life law-abiding self is questioning some life choices right about now.  First things first, the driving in this game is so realistic that I'm considering sending Rockstar my real driver's license for a proper critique. Forget about following traffic rules; I drive through red lights and run over pedestrians like it's a requirement for the in-game DMV. My character must've learned to drive from a blindfolded squirrel with a lead foot.  Let's talk about the characters. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin – the Three Musketeers of crime. Michael's midlife crisis is so relatable; I'm considering taking up yoga and yelling at my therapist, too. Trevor, on the other hand, is so bat-crap crazy that the Joker would be like, ""Dude, tone it down."" And Franklin? He's just trying to make a name for himself in the criminal underworld while also avoiding traffic accidents caused by his idiotic boss (that's me).  The city of Los Santos is a masterpiece – it's like SimCity, but with more explosions and fewer city council meetings. The attention to detail is insane. You can buy clothes, get haircuts, and even play golf. Who knew that planning heists and improving my virtual golf swing would become my favorite pastimes?  The radio stations are gold. I find myself driving aimlessly just to catch the witty banter and questionable music choices. I never knew I needed a fictional talk show about aliens and government conspiracies in my life, but here we are.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is the perfect game for anyone who's ever dreamed of being a criminal mastermind with terrible driving skills. It's a wild ride, and my therapist says I should stop referring to it as my ""crime therapy."" But hey, at least my virtual criminal empire is thriving, even if my real-world parallel parking skills are not. Time to steal more cars and maybe invest in some driving lessons."
It is very VERY good.
엄청 재밎슴 근데 시설이랑 ㅏ동차 가격이좀....
GOOD GAME RAH
the base game is fun af online can be hit or miss but as of 11/27/23 there are a lot of cheaters!!!

HI GAYS HOW TO ADD SPEEDMETER IN GAME GAYS PLESE HELP ME
haha
i love gta games
it's pretty good. story mode was really good for 2012. fun to fuck around in online
why  is there on mission on tthe map?
fucking bs only retards play this game
"its ok, kinda boring but idk"
"id like to start off by saying that this is a pretty good game a solid 8/10 with a great story featuring 3 protagonists and an online mode that has given me many memories. however, 10 years later with over 5000+ hours put into GTA V between different platforms and having done everything the game has to offer i think im about done with this one. now on to wait for the release of GTA VI."
GTA V has one of the best story's of all time. on top of that this game plays and runs great on PC. online is fun at least imo. but i do happen to like to grind games. Now you may be wondering why am I not recommending this game. Well simply put DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ON PC. This games support on PC is horrible. on top of that rockstar removed cars so people would pay for a subscription too access them. a long side that they removed an update 2 years ago that completely changes the game for driving and removing cool cars ( btw this update is in the files). this update was  promised by devs early this year that they are working on an update for PC players to play the E & E DLC. to be honest just go by game pass ultimate and cloud play the game there if you don't have a next gen console. (btw if you make any progress on here it cant be transferred over to console)
10/10 trevor is rlly hot
If Rockstar would develop a system that would block illegal mods this game would be so much better on line. I hope GTA6 would have something in place that would make this happen.
"Very interesting, abd fun, but it is very innapropriate"
varfey good'
gra
fun + you can run people over!
My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on gta and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a car So im just gonna leave this here.
"good game, drive car, hit many pedestrian"
absolute beast of a game. needs more single player support for the modding community
"It's still worth it, just ignore the modders in the online freeroam. And get a friend, do not play alone."
playy
I love the rockstar launcher

The best open world game ever !
I LUV THIS GAME

The best game i played ever
Fun ass game
"The amount of modders and cheaters have gotten so bad over the past few weeks that it has made this game a waste of time. there isn't a single session that isn't messed up from so called ""modders"" it's one thing to just cheat on your own character or game (scummy but whatever) but when your mess the game up for everyone else in the session you are not cool, your just a douche bag. I don't recommend the game, not because of the turds cheating, but because Rockstar does nothing about it and has allowed the sessions to become corrupt to the point that none of them work do to over-modding and not being cleared. outside of a private session (which suck) nothing works right anymore. An extra 96 hr revision: the online sessions are now so buggy do to the amount of ""modder"" cheaters online changing the environment that none of the public sessions work right anymore, they are all ruined and Rockstar still has done nothing. its pointless to play anymore. private sessions still work flawlessly but who wants to play online alone... six thumbs down."
mooney
got banned 10/10 would get banned again (hopefully the second time is for rcism)
zcvc
my work is really cutting into my GTA 5 time. should i quit?
run over peeps and boom boom peeps too
oh my head this is a very very bad because cheaters every where i can't play game or mission's
"Great game! I really enjoy the Story Mode and how well made it is. Starting the story mode really immerses you in the experience, and I simply love it. However, I believe the online mode could use some improvements. The loading can be quite lengthy, sometimes up to 10 minutes, which is insane in my opinion. Despite this, the game is really enjoyable."
yeah its aight
it is good open world game
very of the funs since 2013
"I did't like it, I litrelly love all of the gta games from childhood"
"enjoyed the story, currently at 80% completion, but collecting all those letter scraps, spaceship pieces, and doing those gun range shit seems too tedious! really wanted to 100% this one, but yeah there are more games to explore. thanks for the good time, gtav."
Very fun if you play online with your friends
best if you play rp

"My perfect body is made only by myself as well I allow to kill anyone who lies they ever helped to made my body perfect specially any Medics no one will miss them anyways like Earth Medics dead in morgue will be know why not to steal my perfect body for darkness needs while I play game version Online they can appear in that way other players specially light ones won`t be able to be slayed by them anymore It is not time to act lonely wolf might be used in game I was play game Call of Duty Mobile I was heard text from Zombie mode game play. Maximum speed Michael drives is some 60 maybe 100mph only never at maximum like Need For Speed game version does. Classics quest games. Good graphics, infinity missions make game interesting. It`s like old teacher homepage GTAInside.de mods for GTAV I was tried use settings even was not worked at all if some of them was speak at I was not listen at all and that she was bring something new settings like in Document folder that not works in settings page at all that` why I won`t take hackers and they good known viruses seriously like Chekists not listened by FBI doing work, is worst to listen hacker to download it`s stuff like mods, representing any damage can be done on Earth smallest car crashes like. It`s like a test with one city Los Santos representing Los Angeles city for future use GTA VI like or something bigger game like."
"I love the driving and the graphics, It can be glitchy sometimes but others than that its great!"
"one of the best games i would recommend it, but for me they are better games like watch dogs 2 or something like that. Overall a very good game"
fanatstic game

good and sexy

You spend more time in from loading time until network error rather than playing.
"Best game for online, story mode and rp just get a 2060 or 1070 i htink and ur good of the lag"
good but no
"i love getting crashed by hackers every time i try to play online, strippers add bonus point +1"
"I play this mostly for online and I really really recommend you just play this on console if you only want the online. Game is full of hackers and consistently without fail they will lock onto you and just grief you because they can. I have a whole compilation recorded of hackers just teleporting to me and destroying my cargo. If it wasn't a hacker I can at least fight back and it makes the sell really intense and fun but when it's a hacker I just drop my controller and say bye to 2M worth of cargo because there is no fighting back. I had another cargo griefer teleport me in the middle of the ocean. I had one today just rush to me on an MK2 Oppressor and I didn't know he was a hacker. He blew up my cargo and he used missions on the map to teleport and I been trying to flag him down on a savage helicopter. Finally after catching up with him 15 minutes later I realized he was a hacker because he was tanking the savage helicopter gun and just casually swatted me out of the sky then he followed me into 7 lobbies constantly spawn killing me. Even the day after he followed me continuing to not let me play the game. I recorded the whole thing, emailed Rockstar and they do nothing about this. I try ignoring them and do just pay phone hits and boom I blow up mid mission, then they teleport to me and it begins all over again. IDK what makes hackers target me but it's gotten to the point where I typed to one of them to just leave me alone I am doing nothing to you. His response was to put my street address on the chat and I actually got the police on my door the same day about a hostage situation. The police thankfully knocked first and de-escalated but had I been unlucky this could of easily been an attempted murder. This is why I am writing this review. Letting the hacker issue get to the point where police show up at my door because a hacker just felt like it. I had seen rampant hacker issues in a lot of games but this one is just out of hand I cannot play the game and now opening up the game and doing nothing but playing it as intended can have the police called on me. Rockstar fix this game or strip the live service away, you are actively updating the game how hard is it to just add an anti-cheat. I intended to 100% the game's achievments before GTA 6 gets announced but I give up, this is not fun it is the most stress a single game has ever put me through. I could play on invite only server but that defeats the whole purpose of even playing it in the first place. I want to relive those moments where I get chased by a griefer and that satisfying sigh of relief when you successfully deliver the cargo owning this griefer because money isn't my concern I am looking for a specific experience. Not start up a sell and oh man I give up because a hacker just teleported to me and maybe if he's feeling extra generous won't leak my actual address on top of it."
"so many bloody hackers, gave me levels tho"
"DO NOT get this game, it makes me want to literally blow my brains out. Go buy a mc chicken from mcdonalds instead. {:"
i love iy
Good Game Buy it
just in small words best enjoying game
"bruh, this game is so addictive and good, but the only bad things are the hackers and the modders. hope rockstar can spend more time on banning them."
wery good

"A Tale of Two Worlds - Story Shines, Online Stumbles  Rating : 3.5  Grand Theft Auto V is a game of contrasts, offering players a captivating story mode while also immersing them in the chaotic playground of GTA Online. Let's break it down:  Story Mode (5/5): GTA V's story mode isn't just a narrative; it's a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together the lives of Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. The character development is stellar, with each protagonist offering a unique perspective on the criminal underbelly of Los Santos. The writing is sharp, filled with humor, satire, and moments of genuine emotion. The missions are not just tasks; they're elaborate heists that require meticulous planning, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay. The attention to detail in the open-world environment is astonishing, creating a living, breathing city that reacts to your actions. From adrenaline-pumping chase sequences to quiet moments of introspection, GTA V's story mode is a testament to Rockstar's storytelling prowess and their ability to craft an immersive, multi-faceted narrative.  Online Mode (2/5): The transition to GTA Online, however, is a mixed bag. On the positive side, the vast open world of Los Santos becomes an ever-evolving sandbox, with countless activities and missions to undertake. The customization options for characters and vehicles add a layer of personalization. However, the experience is marred by a significant issue - cheaters.  Cheater Infestation (1/5): GTA Online's biggest downfall is the rampant presence of cheaters. Whether it's invincibility, spawning unlimited resources, or outright disrupting the experience for others, cheaters can turn what should be a thrilling session into a frustrating ordeal. Rockstar's efforts to combat this issue have been inconsistent at best, leaving many players feeling helpless against the tide of unfair advantages.  Conclusion (3.5/5): Grand Theft Auto V is a tale of two worlds. The story mode is a masterpiece, offering a cinematic and immersive experience that stands the test of time. On the other hand, the online component falls victim to the prevalence of cheaters, detracting from what could be an equally compelling multiplayer experience. If you can look past the online frustrations, GTA V remains a must-play for its exceptional single-player narrative."

this game is just some fun that it.
good plus i just bought it on pc and i finished the game on console next gen which is very better. i bought this game because of fivem and etc.
love this
hated every second of it
"Grant Theft Auto is a great game, a very well designed, very well written, very well balanced game that mark the high point of current gen games in almost every aspect. It pains me to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because one obvious problem which I absolutely can not, and will not overlook no matter how great the game is. And that problem is the misogyny through out the game.  If you want to read about how great the game is, you can read any critic reviews from Polygon, gamespot or any other game sites. And I agree with all them, it's a great game. But I want to talk about women in GTA V, or more precisely, the lack of such.  Character development in GTA V is quite interesting. Every single one of characters you end up playing, meeting, working for, fighting with or against, eventually killing...are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They're selfish, obnoxious, arrogant, stupid, and completely insane. They rob banks and kill people without the slightest remorse, they use other people and set them up to killed while pretend to be peaceful and spiritual. They're the everyday morons you see exaggerated 100 times. People would argue that because everyone in Los Santos is horrible in their own way, it is acceptable to have annoying and despicable women character as well.  Here's the difference though. The main characters: Michael, Trevor and Franklin, as well as some of major supporting characters such as Leslie, Dave, or Lamar... They're horrible people indeed, but they all have some kind of redeeming quality, especially the 3 main characters. They're very well crafted extremely flawed characters with a lot of depth, people you despise yet can't help to sympathize. They're people you can relate to from a certain level. Not from being a psychopath (I hope), but realizing that they're facing the same problem we face everyday.  But the girls in Los Santos are annoying, shallow, pathetic, with no redeeming quality. They're there to be funny, or to create obstacles for the main character to overcome. Most of them have very thin back stories, aren't all that interesting, and overall, they're just very badly written. It's almost as if the writers are so taken away by the dynamics between the 3 main character (The bro-mance between Trevor and Michael, the father/son relationship between Michael and Franklin), they just don't care about add women into the game.  I have a half joking theory that Rockstar writers are probably closet women hating gay guys. They're willing to write a main character who's gay, yet unwilling to write a good female character. It's not that they can't, Bonnie in Red Dead Redemption is actually well written, so is Katie in GTA IV. They're real women with real personality, and strong in their own way. I was quite hopeful to see some real changes in GTA V, especially after all those outcry for better female characters in games over the past few years. Oh how was I bitterly disappointed. It would be so nice to have a strong (homicidal or not) girl in GTA universe.  Eventually, I think the writers just don't care. Why should they? The game is making insane amount of money even as misogyny as it is. There's no incentive for them to write good female character other than it would be nice to write good female characters as decent writers.  I guess I should talk a little bit about the actual game other than whine about misogyny. Like I said, GTA V is great. But what impressed me the most is how well balanced the game is. The world is huge, but never overwhelming; the missions are diverse and fun but never chaotic; the character switching is fun and exciting but never hectic even in the middle of the heated gun battle. All of the heists are very well designed, and very fun to play out (I wish there're more).  Michael is probably my most favorite characters in all Rockstar games. He's such a complex character and so different from your typical game protagonist. His psychotic and almost romantic attachment with Trevor, his mentor/fatherly attitude towards Franklin, while still remain a hard cold selfish killer.  Regardless how I think about their misogyny, GTA V is a great game. You should play it."
made me feel like a cutie patootie
"its fun as far as story and SOME online play, basically if you can play alone do but if not would not recommend but its riddled with modders and cheaters. If GTA6 is anything like this im not buying FIX IT"
Just GTA.
really nice game for something made in 2013 highly recommend it
I really like this game and it is my personal favorite i definitely recomend this game becaus it has every feeling franklin is calm trevor is insane and michel is profesional it also has great special abilitys that match each personality great game
very good buddy

"Trash modders ruined this game. if you are ok with loser modders fkin with you sometimes, this is a dope game"
Common guys you all know.....Its best!!!!!
"The gameplay is really fun and the environmental storytelling is super detailed, so it's a great open world to explore!"
too many hacks into the game and glitches within game
Best game of all time but don't buy the steam version buy the rockstar games launcher version instead. The steam version requires you to always be connected to the internet even for story mode. The rockstar games launcher version you can play the game offline.
the best!
Too many hackers
OnLINE IS FUN
Awesome Game loved it while it lasted got ban for playing Online didn't mod but got ban permanent

I play this game just to listen to the radio shows
The best GTA to date.
"The game is a mixed bag. It has some beautiful environments and you can have a lot of fun with it. It does have some major downsides which prevent me from recommending it.  Game breaking bugs and other issues don't get fixed.  - Whenever you load into GTA online, you get the same spam calls before you get together enough money to make them stop by doing what they ask. These are things that require 3 million, 6 million.... It takes weeks if not months for a new player to get this amount of money. - Online takes 6 minutes to load, on an SSD. - Floating uncontrollable van on the Motorcycle Club resupply mission. - Ammo disappearing in online which requires you to re-buy which is incredibly expensive. - Rapid fire bug that makes NPCs insta-kill a player out of nowhere. Been in the game since launch."
Its fine.
Awesome game. 10 years old but definitely not outdated. Looking forward to GTA VI.

"Nearly a decade after release, Grand Theft Auto V remains an entertaining open world games thanks to its vibrant, densely-packed city of Los Santos and a seemingly endless variety of mayhem to unleash. The shooting, driving, and general gameplay still feels great, allowing both scripted antics in the campaign and emergent chaos in the streets. The story mode delivers an engaging criminal story full of the series’ trademark humor. Where GTA V falls short for some fans is in the map design and online experience. While beautiful, Los Santos lacks the scale, diversity, and exploration of previous games like San Andreas. The online component also feels soulless, with a frustrating grind for money and many aggressive microtransactions pushing ""shark cards"" for fast cash. Red Dead Redemption 2 shows how a more balanced and thoughtful online experience provides better fan service."
I would pay triple just for the story
ALL TIME BETTER

FUN AND ENJOYABLE!
"[h1] This city will eat you alive kid. [/h1]  If you let it. It's a big place, full of big dreamers. Optimistic artists, blind German fashion designers, kids fresh out of college trying to convince themselves that their acting degree is worth a f*ck... you name it. It's a cut-throat free-for-all. Every rat in the maze is gonna try to stab you in the back and clamber over your rotting corpse to reach the top of the pile.  When I rolled in, I was as hopeless as everyone else. I got off that plane with nothin' but a clean change of clothes and a half empty bottle of bourbon in my carry-on. Nothin' to drive, nowhere to stay, and not a dollar to my name. All I had was Lamar Davis' phone number. God bless that man... He taught me something very important: when you're in a maze full of rats, you find yourself a pack.  I signed on with an individual known simply as ""The Kewn."" He had merchandise to move, and I had a commercial driver's license. It was a match made in a crack den. To be honest, it was pretty degrading, but it put paper in my wallet. That paper put my name on a lease, a beautiful '72 Saber Turbo in the garage, and a God-blessed American firearm in my hand. It also bought a tiny little warehouse down on Elysian Island.  Every empire starts somewhere, amigo. Mine started when I was blackout drunk. I sunk the chopper carrying my first ever load of cargo into the harbor, and somehow managed to drag the crate through the door before the law showed up. My assistant found me the next morning passed out in a pool of my own urine.  Bit of a bumpy start, but that one crate laid the foundation for what I am today, baby. I clawed my way up to the one percent the old-fashioned way. I wasn't a hot girl who cozied up to some fat, bald Russian f*ck with a fifty foot yacht in Ibiza, full of ditzy, bikini-clad models. Nor was I a Harvard dropout who's daddy paid bail after I crashed my third Pegassi into a strip club, up to my eyebrows on marching powder.  Those Shark Card scum who inherit generational wealth all wind up the same. The hot girls get cosmetic surgery in their late forties when their looks start to fade, inevitably facing the fact that they're bland, vacant shells of a personalty with nothing but a pair of big, pouty lips and a sub-average IQ. The Harvard dropouts graduate when papa makes a generous donation to the board, and then they use their complimentary finance degree in an attempt to re-enact [i] The Wolf of Wall Street [/i] before they die speedballing.   Point is, unlike them, my hands are good and dirty. I'm out there every day flying the choppers, rippin' eighteen-wheelers down the highway, and having civilized, high-caliber discussions with Merryweather Security. Sure, I could kick back on my Aquarius and pop champagne corks at passing jet-skis every time my account jumps up six figures, but I'd run out of bottles pretty quick. Gets boring after a while.  You see, I don't [i] need [/i] to be bustin' my ass this hard. Anything I could ever want is just a phone call away. At this point, the only reason to keep playin' is for the love of the game.  But hey, that's what works for me. You've got your whole life ahead of you kiddo, and you can waste it however you want. Get into professional street racing. Skydive off of Mount Chiliad. Hunt people for sport. F*ck it, play Arena War if you're some sort of psychopath!  Point is, you can do whatever. You. Want.  Just don't forget that there's a million other little rats like you.  [b] And they're [i] all [/i] hungry. [/b]"
it's fun with other people but the hackers are in every sever

i like shooting people in games
its to tryhard
need I say more
"After seeing this scene many times, I have realized that Lamar's roast is actually incredible. By acting as if he's in a hurry and talking quickly, he eliminates the opportunity for Franklin's counterargument, meaning that he can continue delivering his verbal critique.  The use of the phrase ""yee-yee"" is especially clever as it has very loose meanings and is utilized to further demean Franklin while not being necessarily rude, as well as fitting nicely into the rhythm of Lamar's ""smack-talk"" as the youth say. Since a person's hair is usually one of their most stand-out and noticeable features, by ridiculing his, Lamar makes Franklin's identity feel attacked and being shorter means that he's opened to the perspective of one taller than himself having to look down at it, making him especially self-conscious.  Furthermore, by berating Franklin's female partner, Lamar starts to get very personal with him which makes the insults even harsher, while also making Franklin feel inadequate in romantic relationships. As well as this, feigning uncertainty of her secret partner's occupation and referring to intelligent and respectable vocations such as ""lawyer"" and ""brain surgeon"" Lamar attacks Franklin's lack of a formal education.  Finally, the strange and belittling way that he calls him the funny n word further aims to make Franklin seems foolish and by slightly squatting to make eye contact, Lamar subtly roasts Franklin's stature again, as well as his status, making him feel like an insignificant child.  Truly, a genius in the art of ""roasting"" as the youth say."
I did like. best.
A beautiful game  (totally)
I'll probably need a NASA pc to run GTA 6
I remember the first time i played GTA V in 2017 and i truly fell inlove with it. Thankyou for making such a great game! This is my first time buying it since i was a kid back then.
innacurate. police come faster than a cab.
cause it feels like real life
GTA Online has a severe hacker and cheater problem which Rockstar does nothing about.

"Its OLD! For the prices of money in the game. I only would say if you have 1,000 to spend on a game. The game of Online Grand Theft Auto V. SUCKS!"
"Rockstar games is trash, It is locked to my Steam with an email I haven't used or had access to for nearly 10 years. I finally get logged in and I am immediately logged out due to ""altered game files"" which I have never done. This game and company are dog shit."

KOKOTINA TO JE
this game is amazing it could be a little better but it is perfect.
not boring
"as someone who has played every single gta like every game from the gta franchise this game is good, the campaign is awesome online is good but the thing that really amazes me is the fact that u can change characters lol idk why this amazes me but its  really cool, graphics is also pretty good despite it being vanilla the physics is good but aint really as good as gta 4's  physics but its good enough and it wont really mark the game as down right unrealistic with the default physics so its decent. GTA 5 online is not really as good as the campaign for me becuz im not really interested in playing with other people but the missions and heists in online and the cars is awesome lol, and i dont really encounter that much modders anymore so i think rockstar is actually banning them now and actually doing something, if youre planning on modding the game please mod it on single player otherwise u will ruin other people's experience online. Overall this game is great 11/10 good price for things it offers :))"
One of the best game I have played. Very optimized
nice open world game
Very fun game!
Beautifulji
gta 6 where are you?
nice game dosent piss me off like fortnite
I liked buying some shoes in the game🍆🍆 they were so big!!!
כבכככככ
I love burgers and vodka
rockstar is such a shit developer/publisher because of the fact you have to link the games so there for if you lose access to the account you started it with and have no way to access that account you have no way of playing a single rockstar game so honestly rockstar can go fuck themselves
This game is cool!
ICONIC GAME
I am in love!!!!!
the best game ive ever bought this game offers so many things whenever i play it i feel like its my own second life good graphics and storyline

This game is amazing. I haven't played GTA V properly and this is my first time playing this game doing missions. It is very fun and a very amazing storyline it has. I currently have done 22 missions and boy I tell you it is fun.
-;[;
"the game is engaging and has a lot of missions in it. As i have purchased the premium version of this game, I can ensure you that this is a total game-changer while it was released in 2013. The online version has few hackers in it, but if you make your own private online, you can play alone there and enjoy all of the online exclusives. Totally gotta recommend this game!"
The modders ruin the game as of right now.
Waoew
This game makes me want to kick a kitten with a boot made of legos! Not in game!

Really tired of companies allowing me to buy on one platform but then force me to install and run their propritary platform/software to play a game I already paid for. I bought it on steam. I should be able to press play and play the game I paid for without installing your B.S. bloatware social club.

I can't stop playing this game is so fun and using the graphics mods look amazing
"This game is so good. It made me remember of all crime my parents died from. Nevertheless, this is a perfectly curated game for people to indulge hours of their time into. It is a very insanely good game, even being 10 years old."
THIS IS A BEST GAME FOR EVER
Why does killing people in GTA make me happy? It’s the only time I’m ever wanted

"Fun story, brrt brrt"
ngl the most fun after u get some mulla🤑🤑🤑
best game if yall bored lol
"Interested in the story or modded multiplayer? Go for it!  If you're looking to get into GTA Online, save your sanity. Compared to a decade ago, it's in a horrid state. First off, you're no longer playing GTA when you're in multiplayer... you're playing a sci-fi version of Just Cause 3 on an unholy amount of steroids as you prevent World War 3 essentially. Additionally, everything's gotten far more expensive to encourage micro-transactions if you don't want to deal with the abysmal grind and there's even a subscription service now. The anti-cheat is utterly terrible... can't even join a single session without someone or several people using cheat scripts for the sole purpose of ruining everyone's day. No IP address protection, either. Only time the game gets a ""hotfix"" is to patch money exploits, anything else hardly ever gets touched.  TL;DR: Single-player is good, online is awful."
best game evr
i will end myself

"""GTA V: The Loveable Old Grandpa Still Kickin' While We Wait for GTA 6""  Oh boy, where do I even start with this gem? GTA V is like that beloved old uncle who's been crashing on your couch for way too long—still stealing the spotlight, hogging the TV remote, and making you laugh despite overstaying its welcome.  Let's talk about the game. It's like the eternal loop of chaos and shenanigans. You've got Michael, Trevor, and Franklin—these dudes are like the dysfunctional family members you secretly wish were part of your squad in real life. Michael, the retired bank robber turned family man; Trevor, the dude you wouldn't want to be left alone with your snacks; and Franklin, the guy you'd trust to parallel park your car blindfolded.  The world of Los Santos is still more alive than my houseplants, and trust me, that says a lot. You can be a responsible citizen, driving obeying traffic lights... or you can hijack a blimp, fly over the city, and make a heartfelt speech to the seagulls. Your call.  But let's address the elephant in the room, or should I say the lack thereof? Hey, Rockstar, where's GTA 6? Did you misplace it under a pile of cash or something? We're here, twiddling our thumbs, waiting for the next big thing while you're probably brainstorming ways to make us rob casinos on Mars.  But back to GTA V—despite its age, it's holding up better than my attempts at adulting. The graphics might not be cutting edge anymore, but the storytelling? Still top-notch. The multiplayer? A haven for both chaos and camaraderie. And let's not forget the mods, because turning every car into a screaming flamingo or replacing the cops with angry chickens? Pure gold.  So, here we are, giving this game yet another thumbs-up while simultaneously side-eyeing Rockstar for keeping us in suspense about GTA 6. Come on, guys, spill the beans already! Until then, I'll be in Los Santos, probably doing yoga on top of a moving train or trying to make friends with a gang of wandering llamas."

"Overall, GTA V offers an unparalleled gaming experience, setting a new benchmark for open-world games. Its compelling narrative, stunning visuals, diverse gameplay mechanics, and the sheer scope of its world make it a must-play for any gamer seeking an immersive and thrilling adventure.  Rating: 9.5/10"

"Good game, a little silly goofy-ness occurred. Game does seem to hate Bluetooth headphones a little tho they can still work."
Good way to pass time while waiting for GTA 6
niice game
Greatest Game of all time to exist. Rockstar although makes great games they should keep their passion alive and not let greed consume them.
"Oh man, like I shouldn't beat a level 150 guy with a level 5"
"I've played this game dozens of times, even achieving every trophy on PS4 (yes, including the criminal mastermind). I've invested in this game at least seven times, spanning across platforms such as PS3, PS4, X-360, Series-X, and three times on PC, and I've never regretted a single purchase. Undoubtedly, it stands as the most prestigious game of the last decade, and I sincerely hope its successor will be at least half as impressive. A heartfelt thank you to Rockstar Games for creating this truly greatest of all games!"
don't play in public session
fun lot of hackers tho
"good graphics, good online play"
The grind will hit hard af unless you get mods or sum
The developers that worked on GTA Online are morons that should be ashamed of their garbage creation

[h1]Rockstar Games Does It again![/h1]  Game was ok till they added yet another anti-consumer move to their games on anti-social club and for a huge number of players that could play through this game a bunch of times before it is literally unplayable because after a certain update it will not recognize your given e-mail anymore and it forces people to re-buy the game because the R- support sucks.

"I like how the other reviews sound like Wikipedia articles. Here's an actual review from an actual person. If you said that GTA V is the best game of all time, I wouldn't argue with you. What Rockstar did for gaming with this absolute masterpiece cannot be understated. We're still playing it religiously, 10 years after it came out. One decade. Let that sink in. The use of three protagonists was a great idea and really branched out this game in ways we've never seen before. Getting three different perspectives on the same story is extremely interesting. Each of the protagonists holds their own; Trevor is easily one of my favorite protagonists ever; I love the Al Pacino vibe that Michael gives off; and Franklin's journey is awesome to see. The gameplay is top-notch. I love the gunplay, and the driving is stellar; it's much better than the boat steering from GTA 4. The story is incredible; there isn't much of an emotional attachment, but it's still extremely compelling and can easily last for multiple playthroughs. I replay this game once a year because I love it so much. The map is one of the best out there, and there's a reason it's used when judging the maps of new games. Online is a completely different story; it's toxic and pay-to win. It's fun with friends, but random lobbies are awful. Overall, GTA V is a 5/5. There's really nothing that can bring down the score."
awesome  best game

"""Grand Theft Auto V"" is the absolute kingpin of open-world gaming, and Rockstar Games has truly crafted a timeless epic that's still rocking it.  Los Santos is more than just a city; it's a sprawling playground where every neighborhood has its own story to tell. From the glitz of Vinewood to the streets of Grove, the attention to detail is mind-blowing, making every corner worth exploring.  The trio of main characters is a genius move. Michael, Franklin, and Trevor bring unique vibes to the story, and being able to switch between them seamlessly adds a layer of immersion that keeps things interesting.  The story itself is a wild ride of heists, twists, and Rockstar's trademark satire on society. The writing is sharp, the voice acting is spot-on, and the cinematic presentation gives the whole narrative a blockbuster feel.  And let's not forget GTA Online – it's a whole new world of criminal opportunities. Building your empire, pulling off heists with friends, or just causing chaos, there's always something to do. The regular updates keep the online experience feeling fresh and unpredictable.  The gameplay mechanics are top-notch. The driving feels responsive, the combat is satisfying, and the range of activities, from serious heists to absurd yoga sessions, adds that extra layer of GTA charm. The soundtrack is a mixtape of perfection that sets the mood just right.  Sure, the graphics show a bit of wear and tear considering the game's age, but the overall design and vibe of Los Santos still make it a visual treat.  In a nutshell, ""Grand Theft Auto V"" is a masterpiece of gaming. The massive world, memorable characters, and the freedom to dive into chaos or follow the story make it a must-play. Despite its years, the game's still got that magic touch, making it a timeless classic that stands tall in the gaming hall of fame."
its a good game to play with frinds but you cant play it  alone becuse it boring
"dis gem soo gud, yal mus try"
"I really enjoyed Grand Theft Auto V on release, and I still really like the graphics, soundtrack, and the overall gameplay. I find that the driving in particular is very enjoyable, and I don't normally care about driving in games. The story is weak, and focuses heavily on a funding war between two government agencies despite it being obvious that the interactions between the three main characters are far more interesting.   However, over time, it has become harder to recommend. Rockstar is clearly making an absolute fortune from the online mode, and thus has focused all post-release development on this mode instead of doing any single-player DLCs. Unfortunately, the online mode is predatory in the same way that many mobile games are, and deliberately drags out the progression with long wait timers, big money grinds, and other artificial barriers designed to encourage players to buy in-game money with real currency to speed the process up.   Many features in the online game, such as the ability to insure custom cars and have them delivered to you, are exclusive to online play when they almost feel like basic features which should be present in single-player mode. A lot of content, including literally hundreds of cars and weapons, are exclusive to online play as well. Even worse - as this has gone on, the file size of the install has increased to match it (and you cannot install single player only) - it was around 50GB when I first got it, and now sits at 110GB. This game could be amazing to play offline, but Rockstar are fixated on herding players into their online mode in order to milk them for cash."
Good story Love Trevor Good ending (I choose 3)

"I need help. I have tried to contact steam to no avail. Some random person had hacked into my account and linked their social club account to my steam account. So now, I can not play any of my rockstar games! has anyone else ever had to deal with this? Were you able to actually get any support? Send help!!"
Its A really good Game. Has great Characters. A good story line. ETC.
"you could spend a bit of time on it, nothing special though, still a good game."
play it its fun be be ove rthe age of 15 to understnd the gameplay
游戏有病毒都不许玩😄
"I'm a late bloomer when it comes to trendy games, but I can assure people that being as a player that began playing GTA 5's Adventure Mode since Mid-2023, this game still holds up for what's it worth."
The story mode still holds up even 10 years later.
this game is the best oldest game i have ever played
Amazing overall! Must play game.
Gta is the best game
"pretty cool, i sold drugs, guns, fake id's, banged a couple of hookers in my car, did a lot of heists on banks & on a island, killed alot of civilians, police officers and goverment officials, commited grand theft then went home and played gta 5"
this game is really fun and would really second mend this game to other people kids adults anyone but if it is a kid that doesn't know right from wrong then teach them then let them play
to many hackers until patched its trash game
Great ass ganmw!

"After 8 years and 3,5k hours of playing this bullshit, I bought it on Steam to display this as my fav game, cuz I've never  ""wasted"" so many hours on any video game (except Minecraft and Multi Theft Auto)."

best game on the market

well is grand theft auto what else could be sad
"The prices you've applied to Turkey seem like a joke. As a country, we didn't switch to the dollar; Steam switched to the dollar to keep prices stable in Turkey and prevent constant fluctuations. What you should have done was convert the price you applied to us into dollars. In other words, the price would have remained the same, and we would have purchased it in dollars. This was what Steam communicated to us. Despite knowing our low purchasing power, you would never make sales at these prices. You can't manipulate Turkish gamers in this way. Good luck.  Türkiye'ye uyguladığınız fiyatlar adeta bir şaka gibi. Ülke olarak, biz dolar sistemine geçmedik; Steam, Türkiye'de fiyatları sabit tutmak ve sürekli dalgalanmayı önlemek için dolara geçti. Yapmanız gereken şey, bize uyguladığınız fiyatı dolara çevirmekti. Yani fiyat aynı olacaktı, sadece dolar olarak satın alacaktık. Bu, Steam'in bize ilettiği bilgiydi. Düşük alım gücümüzü bilmenize rağmen, bu fiyatlarla asla satış yapmazsınız. Türk oyuncularını bu şekilde manipüle edemezsiniz. İyi şanslar."

GTA 6 when.
Open world. Nearly unlimited choices. Parallels real life is some ways. Needs an improved economic system.
because no
fur toti bani de la tata salalalalala
used to be a fun sandbox game until rockstar decided sharkcards were more important then having fun adding killboxes during map glitches and vehicles no longer being able to go into ammunation they just want to remove any aspect thats a sandbox like fun thing.
the game is better than playing it on consoles. you can play online for free which i totally like and you can use mods for cars and servers which in certain standards is cool. i recommend this game to many people who love to play gta v online or have not tried online yet and wants to give it a go.
Best game ever fr fr
ENTERTAINING
i liked this cs i get to basically do whatever i want
Single Player: 10/10  Multiplayer (current state): absolute dogshit/10
"wish i could load into online without kicked, game shutting off or hackers"

"Good, but waiting for GTA VI tho"
Man i played this game 70 hours a week bc i bought it new but man this game is EVEN perfect in 2023 rockstar better use their chance to make gta 6 better they have the biggest oppurtunity .
its the best openworld game and my first n last feverate game.
fantastic game i ever played and my fav game
"TLDR: Great game, worth it for $15.  -Graphics 8.2/10  -Story 8/10  -Freedom 9.6/10  -Capitalism 13/10  As always, it's GTA so of course it will be nearly perfect in the realm of RPG/Action/Adventure games. It's a huge AAA title, so it's going to have some bugs, even 10 years or more after release, but that doesn't detract from the perfection that is the GTA series. There's a reason it's one of the most well-known RPG games on the market.   I haven't experienced anything game breaking from playing it on Xbox 360, Xbox One, Series X and now PC. It's well worth it for $15 during the Autumn Steam Sale, but I don't see myself paying $30 or $50 for the game + DLC content/money shark cards. Just buy the ""premium"" edition for $15 and spend a day or two grinding in online mode if you want the $4m from the shark card, save that cash!"
An Icon in the gaming industries.

GOOD ONE...!
"Not going to lie story is very over rated it never sticks to one thing its just a mess of different stories and online so many greffers,modders,the first  time i played online my car catches on fire just 10 seconds after i leave my garage and they had a lot of time to fix it and rockstar released a game and is about to release a other game and still is not fixed so i don’t recommend maybe Consol version is kinda worth it but pc version is just a waste of storage"
ye buddy lightweight <3

Need to connect to a rockstar social account (because why) that's apparently not valid for steam.

this is dubs game (i like killing innocent people)
"Hello, viewers! This is my review of Rockstar Games' [i] Grand Theft Auto V [/i]!  [h1] Table of Contents [/h1] This is the order in which I will go over certain aspects of the game: [list] [*]Story [*]GTA Online [*]Modding Community [*]Final Thoughts [/list]  [h1] Story [/h1] The story of [i] GTA V [/i] is so masterfully crafted, I don't know where to start! The story from start to finish is AMAZING, much like [i] Grand Theft Auto 4's [/i] story. The only thing that makes [i] GTA V's [/i] story a tiny bit better is the fact that the story never really gets repetitive, which was my only gripe with [i] GTA 4's [/i] story. The fact that there's 3 main characters, all with different backstories and fully fleshed out is amazing as well!  [h3] Endings [/h3] In this sub-chapter, I'm going to discuss the endings of the games, so if you don't want spoilers, the rest will be blacked out using the spoilers feature. [spoiler] The 3 endings of the game are all meaningful in their own right. 2 of the 3 endings involving Franklin killing one of the 2 other main characters, Michael or Trevor. The third ending, being the Deathwish ending, sees Franklin save both Michael and Trevor from being killed. The Deathwish ending is personally my favorite ending, as it is the most action-packed ending of the entire game. [/spoiler]  [h1] GTA Online [/h1] [i] GTA Online [/i] on PC is very dangerous to play at the moment due to hackers and IP grabbers, however the console version (Xbox One, PS4, Xbox Series X|S and PS5) is really fun to play with friends. However public lobbies are not worth going into, because in my experience, getting griefed every 10 seconds by a level 1000 gets annoying after a while.  [h1] Modding Community [/h1] The modding community for PC is amazing. There's many fun mods out there to play, my favorite being [i] LSPDFR [/i] which is one of the most popular [i] Grand Theft Auto V [/i] mods of all time. There's another mod named [i] FiveM [/i] which is also popular amongst Twitch streamers. There's multiple ways to mod and manipulate the game and I suggest doing that once you've beat the story mode.  [h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] This game, in my humble and honest opinion, is the SECOND best [i] Grand Theft Auto [/i] game, the first being [i] Grand Theft Auto 4 [/i] (if that wasn't obvious already). However if I were to rate the game on a scale from 1/10, I'd give it a 8.5/10 (due to the Online mode being unplayable on PC and somewhat unpleasant on console). Anyways, if you enjoyed reading this lengthy review, please leave a like saying the review was helpful! Also I hope this review helped you make your decision on whether or not you wanted to buy this game!"

"Its full of cheaters just like RDR2O, I also hate the Character Creation like RDR2O is infinitely better then GTAO, and another issue with it for me is that RS will not do anything new until this thing ends so nobody buy it please."

I was introduced to this game by my law enforcement father. I'm still committing crimes IN THIS GAME 10 years later.

"""The captcha challenge failed to load. Please check your network connection and try again.""  Tried so many methods I could find on the internet but nothing worked. All rockstar games in my steam library turns digital garbage because cannot login."
"Used to be my fav game, but now hackers rule the game. Rockstar is just minting money from game sales and add-ons, they are not interested in making any kind of anti-cheat layer in the game.  I am done with this game."
stuff
"Due to Take Two Interactive the franchise is going down the drain. Take Two Initiative has set down most of the major mods that have supported the game, if you are thinking that you want to play things like zombies for example, it is no longer working with modders leaving and retiring. Rockstar has been putting anti-modding programs together to shut down the modding community while at the same time saying ""we support modding"" while being responsible for shutting down the modding platform for GTA. A lot of people are going to have to be fired because they are actively bringing the company down as shown by their actions contradicting their words."
Hell Yeah

good game but where is gta 6 at i all reday i had time make a whole family lol
im a gay nigger

"your average night in gta online will consist of grinding for real life hours or even days on a 4 million dollar business thing only to lose it all in a second because some 14 year old fuckhead ""thought it would be funny"" to go god mode and blow up your shit"
"This game is good for people who seek for a pleasure of successful and also for strategy, and story enjoyer. I would rate it 8/10."
it is definitely a game
pvp take life over
Awesome possum
"Apart from the negative of Rockstar's notorious greed, GTAO is also absolutely infested with hackers. I've played it since the day it was available on PS3 (to the few who could connect) and I love the game, but this version has a lot of irritating problems that make it hard to recommend to new players."
i like the violence
it is super to play with friends it is a must buy
"Don't recommend, In my own experience, I can barely play the game without people modding, spawn killing and just ruining the game for me. the game is nice though.."
its fun af
CAR VROOM
Dope game. Fun by yourself or with others. Make sure to go crazy when playing it's the best way possible.
GOAT Theft Auto V + oppressor Mk II
10/10 I LOVE IT
"Rockstar likes to randomly disable accounts, accounts you may have spent actual money on, and then not respond to help queries. Literally CAN'T play this game now because it REQUIRES being logged in to their dumbass proprietary launcher (don't you LOVE those???) with an account connected to Steam. I can't log in, can't reset password, and if I try to just create a new account I am told there is already one associated with my Steam. Won't EVER buy a Rockstar game again. Fuck these devs."
Well built game :)
there are ants in my skin i need to get them out help
amazing story
best sandbox game
still fun in 2023
Idk why but I just cant play it any more and I want my money back because they did it for no reason and they keep talking about some activion code and social club or not putting in shit but its so annoying on how hard they tryin to not let me play
it is awesome
"This is a little late but I can't believe how bad this game has become.   Everything's pay-to-play. Shark cards are expensive as hell despite the game originally costing like €50. Even if you have enough money to buy vehicles, you're not allowed to buy them until you fulfill some garbage prerequisite. This game is nothing but a money maker for Rockstar and it's just utter trash.   If you want to just have fun and not get killed by randos you have to play FiveM. Hackers are STILL a rampant issue but god forbid you get money from one cause you'll be punished for it. Trying to join up on friends online the game constantly errors out and kicks you back into single player or different server. While trying to run, if you happen to accidentally go too near to a mission or whatever, it'll take you into the mission without you wanting to and leaving it trying to get out of it kicks you out of the server sometimes.   Thanks for turning this game into absolute garbage, Rockstar. I've always loved the series but you have officially made this entirely unplayable.   GTA6 is going to look great and seem like a good idea but I know it's going to the same nonsense but more expensive. I hate this game with every fiber in my being."
i love the grafix
really good game but there is bad laguge do recomend!
Time
modderss make the game fun if u talk to the 10/10
I have played this game for almost 7 years and it's amazing
"Story mode is great obviously, but online is a sh*t show. Cheaters in literally every single lobby, multiple cheaters, who will go out of their way to ruin your day, terrorize you until you're forced to leave. Cheaters will also disconnect you from online, crash your game, etc. There is almost no reason to grind for cash as you can just have some skank ass modder give you money, or you could just buy a mod menu. You literally cannot report people who are cheating, as the cheaters can intercept these reports and even see who filed a report and then subsequently crash your game. Screw R* for allowing this cheating epidemic to just run rampant. It just baffles me how R* can neglect such a large portion of their player base, what a sh*tty developer. Shame on you R*."

It was a good game at first now its pay to have fun things in the game or have no life meh not worth it

"You can not import your GTA Online Character from console. BUT, they USED TO support being able to do that, but not anymore.  So if you're thinking of transferring from any console, just know you can't."

AMAZING A lot of experiences to cover a lot of different things you could do OVERALL I give it a 10/10 but I would say 15+ 18+ seems a bit extreme
"I don't really have alot to say about GTA V. In short, it's a good game to get when on sale, just be weary when you go online"

"The last good GTA game was GTA4, now we have GTA5 the cash cow for the sheeples. and GTA 6 you will be paying real cash by the hour yo be able to play it. The shine is gone, Take Two as many other AAA companies have become perverted by greed."
very fun khamala khan
story is amazing but them load times online kinda suck. AI is more accurate than an abusive father on meth sometimes but still fun
i dont really play the missions that much I just like mass murder
Loved this game.  Worth the money.
Good Game With A Decent Story

Great Game with awesome Graphics
"Grand Theft Auto is a series of action-adventure games created by David Jones and Mike Dailly.[2] Later titles were developed under the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by British development house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by its American parent company, Rockstar Games. The name of the series is a term for motor vehicle theft in the United States.  Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can complete missions to progress an overall story, as well as engage in various side activities. Most of the gameplay revolves around driving and shooting, with occasional role-playing and stealth elements. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The games in the Grand Theft Auto series are set in fictional locales modelled after real-life cities, at various points in time from the early 1960s to the 2010s. The original game's map encompassed three cities—Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco),[a] and Vice City (based on Miami)—but later titles tend to focus on a single setting and expand upon the original three locales. Each game in the series centres on different respective protagonist who attempts to rise through the criminal underworld due to various motives, often accompanying themes of betrayal. Several film and music veterans have voiced characters in the games, including Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, William Fichtner, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda.[3]  DMA Design began the series in 1997, with the release of the Grand Theft Auto. As of 2020, the series consists of seven standalone titles and four expansion packs. The third main title, Grand Theft Auto III, released in 2001, is considered a landmark game, and brought the series into a three-dimensional environment for the first time. Subsequent titles have followed and built upon the format established by Grand Theft Auto III, receiving significant acclaim. The games influenced other open-world games, and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar titles.[4]  The series has been critically acclaimed, with all the main 3D entries in the franchise frequently ranked among the greatest and best-selling video games;[5] it has shipped more than 405 million units, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises. In 2006, Grand Theft Auto was featured in a list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum.[6] In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britain's most successful exports.[7] The series has also been controversial for its adult nature and violent themes, as well as for cut content."
best pc game.
Single player is a decent campaign. Online has serious issues with hackers.
"bad launcher, i lost 2 of my account already because its says email is invalid, i even put it on my notes is not that i forgot the account. I lost my money cause of this."

Rockstar refuses to deal with the state of online and modders. Public lobbies are basically unplayable. Spend more time loading the game than you can in a session.

Love everything about this game so far. i haven't played since Vice City either.
i was not Intrested in this game firstly but when i did start t play its  awsome!!!!!
It's GTA V.

"However many years after release and this game still has a bug related to sound output. After the first 10 second intro there is no sound in the game. Related, why does this game require access to my microphone to play single-player?"
I've play  GTA 5 on the Xbox a lot and when i finally get to PC I've seen a lot of hackers and them being around me got my new account on PC ban and I've been trying to play more but cant so its not even worth this bull. The 28 hours is me trying to load the game. I've only played for like 5 hours.

Yo we got gta v before gta vi💀💀🤯
"Man, this is one of the best games ever man. Literally spent 1000+ hrs on this and I still feel I haven't seen all it has to offer. World building together with the awesome story and *addictive* online mode really make this game really great. I'm actually playing this on my crappy Intel HD 620 laptop and having a blast! Mind you this came out in 2013 when I was 11 yrs old and now having it for myself feels like a fever dream to me. Could not recommend this game enough to everyone. Funny thing is when GTA VI finally comes out, I'll be the one buying it for myself XD. (also help me get a better PC pls?)"
GTA 6 give me loto in real life
i lave
boy best game
this is a video game
the modders make me wanna inhale illegal amouts of cholorform then touch elmo like hes a minor

Need friends.
Only story mode is recommended

I have been playing this for ten years. Please drop a new Grand Theft Auto..... Please....
"crap that i pay money for this game and someone can come along and hack my email and cause it so i cant play the game and the lack of help the rockstar support does to resolve this issue. The CD key is another one too, like WTF for a one time use for social club like how is that right? Especially when you account gets hacked/ someone changes your email!!!!!!"

"Campaign is just amazing including the Graphics ! I dont play Multiplayer in Any Game as I cant be bothered with encountering dumb kids  and seeing Idiots in call of Duty running around, jumping out of 5 story windows and shooting everybody they encounter! Idiotic  But I  assume that Multiplayer is great too !"
If you like GTA then... play it
gee tee ay five
"rockstar is more interested in having their own bloatware to get in the way of people playing their games, cant get into my own account because some hacker got into it and now i cant play this or rdr2 because i cant just change my password."
Criminality
GTA 6 is wayyyy better
Amzing game facinating storyline
"DO NOT BUY GAMES FROM ROCKSTAR. A hacker recently stole my Social Club account for GTA V. And you need this account to even play the single player game because of their horrible DRM. And so I contacted their support and they refused to help me get my Social Club account back. So now I can never play this game ever again with this Steam account. What a waste of money. Yeah, GTA V is a good game but that doesn't matter if anytime a hacker can steal the game from you because Rockstar doesn't care about their customers."
Amazing story
good game lots of story to play through
i need steam point :)
is good game yes
peak of gaming

"English:  Homemade Landjäger Sausage  Ingredients: - 500 g beef - 500 g pork - 20 g curing salt (nitrite curing salt) - 5 g coarse ground pepper - 5 g sweet paprika - 3 g garlic powder - 2 g ginger powder - 2 g dried marjoram - 1 g ground coriander - 1 g grated nutmeg - 1 g ground cardamom - Pork casings for stuffing - Kitchen twine  Instructions: 1. Cut the beef and pork into small pieces and pass them through a meat grinder with a coarse plate. 2. Place the ground meat in a large bowl and add all the spices (curing salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, ginger powder, marjoram, coriander, nutmeg, and cardamom). Mix well until the spices are evenly distributed. 3. Cover the meat mixture and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours to allow the flavors to develop. 4. Thoroughly clean the pork casings and soak them in cold water to soften. 5. Remove the meat mixture from the refrigerator and knead it again to ensure proper blending. 6. Stuff the meat mixture into the prepared pork casings, ensuring there are no air pockets and that the casings are evenly filled. 7. Cut the filled casings into approximately 10 cm long pieces and tie the ends with kitchen twine. 8. Hang the Landjäger sausages in a cool place to dry for about 2-3 weeks. The ideal temperature is around 15-18 degrees Celsius. 9. After the drying period, the Landjäger sausages are ready to be consumed. They can be enjoyed raw or lightly pan-fried.  Note: When making sausage, it is important to maintain proper hygiene. Ensure all utensils are thoroughly cleaned, and use fresh meat. It is also recommended to familiarize yourself with basic sausage-making principles and consider employing specific sausage-making techniques.    German:  Selbstgemachte Landjäger Wurst  Zutaten: - 500 g Rindfleisch - 500 g Schweinefleisch - 20 g Nitritpökelsalz - 5 g Pfeffer, grob gemahlen - 5 g Paprika, edelsüß - 3 g Knoblauchpulver - 2 g Ingwerpulver - 2 g Majoran, getrocknet - 1 g Koriander, gemahlen - 1 g Muskatnuss, gerieben - 1 g Kardamom, gemahlen - Schweinedärme zum Abfüllen - Küchengarn  Zubereitung: 1. Das Rind- und Schweinefleisch in kleine Stücke schneiden und anschließend durch den Fleischwolf mit grober Scheibe drehen. 2. Das gewolfte Fleisch in eine große Schüssel geben und alle Gewürze (Nitritpökelsalz, Pfeffer, Paprika, Knoblauchpulver, Ingwerpulver, Majoran, Koriander, Muskatnuss und Kardamom) hinzufügen. Gut vermengen, bis die Gewürze gleichmäßig verteilt sind. 3. Die Fleischmasse abgedeckt für mindestens 24 Stunden im Kühlschrank ruhen lassen, damit sich die Aromen entfalten können. 4. Die Schweinedärme gründlich reinigen und in kaltem Wasser einweichen, um sie geschmeidig zu machen. 5. Die Fleischmasse aus dem Kühlschrank nehmen und erneut gut durchkneten. 6. Nun den Fleischteig in die vorbereiteten Schweinedärme füllen. Dabei darauf achten, dass keine Luftblasen entstehen und der Darm gut gefüllt ist. 7. Die gefüllten Därme in etwa 10 cm lange Stücke schneiden und die Enden mit Küchengarn verschließen. 8. Die Landjäger für ca. 2-3 Wochen an einem kühlen Ort zum Trocknen aufhängen. Die ideale Temperatur liegt bei etwa 15-18 Grad Celsius. 9. Nach der Trocknungszeit sind die Landjäger bereit zum Verzehr. Sie können roh gegessen werden oder kurz in einer Pfanne gebraten werden.  Hinweis: Bei der Herstellung von Wurst ist es wichtig, auf hygienische Standards zu achten. Sämtliche Utensilien sollten gründlich gereinigt und das Fleisch frisch sein. Es empfiehlt sich außerdem, sich mit den Grundlagen der Wurstherstellung vertraut zu machen und gegebenenfalls auf spezielle Wurstherstellungstechniken zurückzugreifen.   Chinese:  自制兰德亚格香肠  材料： - 500克牛肉 - 500克猪肉 - 20克食盐（亚硝酸盐食盐） - 5克粗磨黑胡椒 - 5克甜辣椒粉 - 3克大蒜粉 - 2克姜粉 - 2克干马郁兰 - 1克芫荽粉 - 1克磨碎肉豆蔻 - 1克磨碎草果 - 猪肠衣（用于填充） - 厨房绳  制作方法： 1. 将牛肉和猪肉切成小块，然后通过带有粗孔板的绞肉机绞碎。 2. 将绞碎的肉放入一个大碗中，加入所有的香料（食盐、黑胡椒、甜辣椒粉、大蒜粉、姜粉、马郁兰、芫荽粉、肉豆蔻和草果）。充分搅拌，使香料均匀分布。 3. 盖上碗，放入冰箱中静置至少24小时，使香味融合。 4. 彻底清洁猪肠衣，并将其浸泡在冷水中软化。 5. 从冰箱中取出肉馅，再次揉捏均匀。 6. 将肉馅填入准备好的猪肠衣中，确保没有气泡并且填充均匀。 7. 将填充好的猪肠衣切成约10厘米长的小段，用厨房绳扎紧两端。 8. 将兰德亚格香肠挂在凉爽的地方晾干约2-3周，理想温度为摄氏15-18度。 9. 干燥期结束后，兰德亚格香肠即可食用。可以生食或轻微煎炒。  注意：制作香肠时，保持良好的卫生非常重要。确保所有器具彻底清洁，并使用新鲜的肉类。还建议熟悉基本的制香肠原则，并考虑采用特定的制香肠技巧。"

"Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. Their appearance as a common plant was in the mid-Cretaceous period. There are 12,000 species now.[3]  A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. That is because they are wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, so they do not have to attract insects. Green is the best colour for photosynthesis.  Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant cover 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, except Greenland and Antarctica.[4]  Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants. They include the ""grass"" of the family Poaceae, which are called grass by ordinary people. This family is also called the Gramineae, and includes some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[5] These three families are not very closely related, though all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a similar life-style.  With about 780 genera and about 12,000 species,[3] the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family. Only the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae have more species.[6]  The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.  Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow tall, such as bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very arid or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such, but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.  Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[7] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion)."

Can’t even play the game because I’m unable to login into my R* account. Tried to contact the support several times but they won’t help you at all. Utterly garbage!
"this shit goood, ngl"
"Hell Yes, even if you are not the biggest fan of action games, the story and music will keep you coming back for more, GTA V is what you make of it. Enjoy it to the max."
"I don't think you understand, so let me enlighten you. This game made me like women. I have seen more boobs in this game than in real life. Am I sweaty neck beard? No. But do I like boobs. Eeeeeeeeyup"
...yes.
"One of the most wholesome communities i've ever enjoyed, they only sometimes say the n word!"

"The game is esentially good, however Rockstars ""security"" is outrageous, why do we have to suffer at the start?"
very good very fascitnating and interesting
Played mostly on PS before PC. If it was moderated and hacker problem sorted I would still be playing as used to love it before the hackers. Unplayable now.
"RIP GTA5. This poor thing has been flogged to absolute oblivion and wrung of every cent. What was once a fun game to fluff around on quickly became a grind just to be able to upgrade a car, weapon or house within a few years.   It's now that bad, boring and unplayable thanks to stupid updates and content add-on's. Flying motorcycles?! F*****g pleeeease.  Franklin/Michael/Trevor storyline was a B-grade sit-com in 2013. 10 years later its just insufferable."
I shoot the fat people
To be honest everyone has to play this game at least once this game is the best game ive ever played the graphics are beautiful. gameplay is so fun. and if you have friends youre going a have a blast every time you play with friend or alone this game is perfection

"Do you like having things stolen? Like all of the hard earned money you were trying to cash out? What about your entire account? Better yet, what about your private IP address?  Well with GTA V, you can put all of these things at risk of being taken, just by playing the game!  No but seriously, don't touch this shit. I do not care about the quality of their games. Stop supporting this company. People around the world are having major parts of their privacy stolen just by trying to play this game, because Rockstar can't be bothered to spend money on having any kind of working network security."
cars go fast and there is drugs 10/10
murdering NPC's is fun
This piece of shit game is possibly the most retarded piece of code ever to be put on the internet.
"I've been playing this game since it came out. Throughout the years it has been fun. Every once in a while you would get an update to make the game more fun. but since 2020 the game has gone down hill. You got the sense that rockstar was beating a dead horse to get more income for minimal work. In the last year i would give it a 1 out of 100. I have played the online mode for the last couple months averaging about 50 hours a week. EVERY SINGLE LOBBY has a modder that is unregulated that kills you, transports you, griefs you and literally makes the game unplayable. I WOULD NOT recommend this game to anyone anymore."
It's GTA don't wait

Loved the game though im alone. Looking for other people to play with especially filipinos i want my own kind and others aswell.
Dog shit
"Really disappointed with GTA V on PC in 2023. It started as a console port where all the design elements were still focused around controlling the game with a console controller. Eight years later, none of the problems caused by the console port have been fixed. There are also still extremely long loading times for every load screen no matter the PC's performance. On top of this, multiplayer is near impossible because of the number of people who are able to run scripts and cheats in multiplayer without penalty. As I said these have been issues since the game's release on PC but never fixed. Instead they keep pumping out more and more boring missions and game modes and ever more ridiculous vehicles and weapons to try sell the game to new players or so existing players will buy RP. It's evident this company is not interested in retaining players long-term, it's just a pump-and-dump strategy. I'm done."
قبابف غهغهرغه
they banned me for no reason
I know it's 10 years old  but I play for the online. it's really fun till today
It is the most fun realistic robbery game that i play and i play it when i get frustrated and you can't go to jail for shooting people and blowing up buildings
its GTA 5 i dont think i have to say why the game is good
THIS IS IS KINDA LIKE THE MOST REALISTC GAME EVER!
"Error with Rockstar Game Launcher, I already have steam I don t need another launcher that crashes"
shit is fire
arman123

It's fun even in 2028..
frickin gnarly dude

GTA is GTA. It cannot be compared to anyone.
"Its fun with friends, solo in public is horrible, alot of weirdos"
tr gv
That s the best game
great!
Best game I've played
"I love the realism in the game, sooo true to life. If this had stars, I would put 10/10."
really good game i def recommend its so fun in online
"Very toxic game and a lot of cheaters,"
"Let it be clear that I was NOT offered $15,000,000,000 GTA dollaps by a guy named Sanz on discord and I do NOT recommend taking that ALLEGED deal if you happen to come across it"
"Simple 0/10 for their shitty malfunctioning and incredibly annoying ""Rockstar games launcher"""
"good game, not in bad sport tho"
dddddddddddddd
real fun game where you can just chill or rob banks and stores etc
Best gta
story mode is really good online is only fun with friends
"Five-M the game (or asset pack)  Big Psa :  Do NOT play on the official gta online servers UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES because it is full of ip-pullers/ddosers and hackers that can seriously mess your pc/R* account up. R* keeps pushing monetisation practices and all sorts of non-sense grind while never addressing the hacker problems.. leaving everyone exposed to all sorts of trouble due to low security.  However as it stands now, if you really want to play gta in multiplayer then stick to using Five-M to play."
AWESOME GAME
hey good game
"haven't played in 4 years, driving around in a very old flying motorcycle or w/e the hell its called and got orbital cannoned. I guess I grew up, thanx for the 109gb of storage space back."

Gta.

"The entire rockstar launcher program that goes with the game ruins the game. I cant even get my account back because it magically linked to another account. Plus if I wanted to make a new one they don't let you. If you unlink your steam with the rockstar launcher you can never play online again. There's also no way to look up what email you used to connect your steam to rockstar launcher. Bruh this game came out 8 years ago, I was a kid when I setup this rockstar bs. Atleast let me update my info so I can play online again. Once they allow you to relink your steam to the launcher this game is unplayable for me."
fucking pixels on the texture
DONT GET IT
Gta is the happiest game eva!!! I brought this game for my son and he went to the shoe store!!! i honestly think this is the best game imginable!
i need update ples
this game is worth the money i would buy it again
"Decent game overall, despite having at times long loading screens."
WORLD'S BEST GAME
this is the best game ever made
"ngl Amanda's got that 'down-bad' effect on me, SMASH!"

just a normal day in tondo
Wow I learned so much from this game!
pica dms
I don't really like GaaS and I'm not a fan of GTA Online so I understand that reviewing this game as a singleplayer experience doesn't make much sense BUT... This game is not very far away from perfection.
legal

CAR VROOM VROOM
koso sher
so many cheaters it's annoying and no way to report it!
Really fun game especially for mods such as LSDPFR
buggy as hell but somehow the fun factor outweighs the inconvinience
Story line Is THE best
I LOVE GTA SO MUCH
to much modders
very good game gta5
greate game best grand theft auto beside gta san andreas and IV
Really enjoying Online version with friends....
worst game for missions if u cant complete the gruesome time taking mission (like 30+ mins ) but still cant complete due to glitches like the yellow marker not working or not taking you in to complete the task......happens to me every day now this glitch makes me not to play the game again.
absolute greatness
Totally Marvellous
worth buying
神作，不用解释
"The story is so good, singleplayer campaign is excellent. GTA Online tho skip if you can, not much is really worth as you can only grind so many things that ACTUALLY make you enough money to run heists. Also, rockstar milking GTA duh along with the number of cooldowns that are in this mode make it more of a slog to play.   Basegame is fair and touching, online is filled with hackers (yes you will be autobooted into a PUBLIC lobby after any activity, even if in an invite only session) and has a far slower pace that makes you wish it was just a co op version of the singleplayer campaign."
it's decent gta iv is the goat still
bikini girl in loading screen hot
Best open world game ever
PC online mode is full of cheaters.  Rockstar just can't handle it.  I need go to Invite Only Session.  Hopefully in GTA 6 it will be better.
Fun game since the orginal first came out
"Very good game, played it forwards, backwards and upside down back on PS3, online is great but it is getting a bit tired in my opinion. Hyped for my grand kids to be able to play GTA6 tho."
Wow! Gta 6 is finally gonna have a trailer!!!!
go play go play
mmmm crime
babies are in here it's very good I got sent a free copy since I won a bet
hot lady styff :0-:
Yes :)
"This game for me was very laggy, glitchy, and freezing. It was like this without mods and like this with mods. I was no able to play the game. I have downloaded this on different steam accounts and it was the same issue."
Everytime I buy cash cards I always try to use them but they never work how do I make them work on pc
Maybe someday we'll get another one.

I would say this is the best GTA game so far. However they seriously need to chill with the nudity and stuff like that since there is no need for it.

"If you're thinking about picking this up to have some fun with GTA Online, DON'T. Get it for console, if you really have an itch to play. Online is currently next to unplayable for any normal gamer due to the rampant cheaters, which the community calls 'modders' for some stupid reason. What's worse is that Rockstar does next to nothing about it.   98% of the time you will run into a cheater in your server, or whatever game modes you like to play. The only question will be whether they just like to mess with server config stuff like making all NPC's aggressive, or making any nearby vehicles despawn, or more malicious stuff like insta killing you for no reason, teleporting you to an inescapable room, so they can kill you. One thing is for sure, even the good natured 'modders' will kill you if you try for an objective, or to do anything, really.  They use invincibility, fly around, can blow you up out of nowhere, pop the tires on your car repeatedly, spawn vehicles on top of you, bombard you with invisible semi trucks, send you to a menu that is only leavable by alt+f4'ing which tries to download god-knows-what.  I have not had a single session where I was able to just enjoy the game, get fair fights, or even have a chance to accomplish anything. If you do it is just by the good graces of the hackers that literally run the game, and most of the time they will ruin your experience just to be cancerous.   Also worth noting that almost all of my online achievements were forced on me by a hacker I upset, so he found all of the packages, movie probs, easter eggs etc on my account and instantly boosted me. Again... game ruined by hacking low-lifes that just want to ruin this game for people.   TLDR: Online is unplayable because Rockstar doesn't care about the PC community and let's cheaters run the game however they want. The cheaters main goal is to make the game entirely unplayable for any normal gamer (someone not using cheats)."
Nice Game. Good
"No, not recommended. If your connection sucks, pls dont play this game. You will be frustrated with the bugs and glitch in the game. Moreover, There are a lots of hackers. Thus, connections problem, it is the worst problem here. i have played a while and i have stuck with connection problem. It is causing my game to crash, glitching and bugging."
"If you buying this game just play story mode, online mode are sh*t"
okok
W GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
one of the best games of decades. it's fun to play with group of friends online with all heist and stuffs.
VERRY GOOOOGD
i give revaing
v.GOOD ABB
this is not just a game ....this is emotion :)
ddddddd
"Well I m playing in 2024 but the game was my dream from 7th grade and I even don't know about the story line I just need to drive cars and crash it but as a mature person Michael character was a good character in my thought because he tries to be a family person in a best way the previous rockstar games like vice City,san Andreas and gta 4 are focused on gangster but these game has a little bit reality of a person so anyways I m eagerly waiting for GTA 6 all ways a fan for rockstar 🙌"
many bug nice
made me erect alots
its soo good and doesent crash
DONT BUY MAKE YOU WANNA KILL YOURSELF

"GTA 5 is an unparalleled open-world experience that has absorbed me for over 2000 hours. Rockstar Games has created a masterpiece that continues to captivate players with its expansive world, diverse gameplay, and engaging narrative.  The sheer scale of Los Santos is mind-boggling; every corner brims with life, from bustling city streets to the serene countryside. The attention to detail is impeccable, making exploration a constant delight. Whether engaging in high-speed chases, completing intricate heists, or simply soaking in the vibrant environment, there's always something new to discover.  The trio of protagonists adds depth and variety to the gameplay, each with their own distinct personality and storyline. The missions are diverse, offering a perfect balance of action, strategy, and adrenaline-pumping moments.  The multiplayer mode, GTA Online, is a world in itself. The ever-expanding content, ranging from heists to races and businesses, ensures that boredom is a foreign concept. The community aspect, coupled with the constant updates, makes for an evolving and dynamic online experience.  However, despite its brilliance, GTA 5 isn't without flaws. Occasionally, certain missions might feel repetitive, and the online experience can be affected by occasional glitches or connectivity issues. Yet, these minor setbacks are overshadowed by the game's overall brilliance.  After thousands of hours, GTA 5 remains a pinnacle of gaming excellence. Its immersive world, engaging gameplay, and limitless possibilities make it a timeless classic that continues to draw me back for more."
when i first played it was the best 5 was good but online is better but the toxic people is bad
I love running over the elderly!
BEST GAME WITH AWESOME GRAPHICS AND GAMEPLAY
its really good but gta 6 has bin  announced
Easily one of the best made games over the last decade. IMO
yez
"Game has great graphics,story and activities to do."
Feels like home!
this is a nice game
"I mean what's there to describe, this game is an absolute beauty providing an never ending thrilling and a fun experience. However the only Demerit is that there are still a load of cheaters in GTA online will ruin the overall raw experience of the online version of the game."
This game is SO addicting. I had other games which I played for 12 hours a day but then GTA5 went above them! I have been playing GTA5 for so long. I reccomend to thers.
"goood, next one better hopefully"
"So much to do and discover, I usually forget about the main questlines. Its great!"
bhvb
Gta5 is fun with or without friends.
Amazing Game Exceptional Quality For A 2013 game
"Anti-cheat doesn't work properly. Game incentivizes buying shark cards to gain an advantage, promotes griefing, and is very frustrating to play."
Needs more Rick grimes.
i keep trying to go out for ONE SINGLE ARRANT and end up doing tens of thousands of property damage  Greatest open world game ever  F**k Tears of the Kingdom

brrrrrrrrrrrrt
"''you forget a thousand things everyday pal, make sure this is one of them''"
I love
i love the game its awesam you cam put mods
Still an amazing open world the best one but the online optimisation sucks
"In the grandiose tapestry of interactive entertainment, one gem gleams with a brilliance that transcends mere virtual escapades – Grand Theft Auto V, a magnum opus that encapsulates the epitome of digital storytelling and open-world immersion. This opulent masterpiece, birthed from the creative crucible of Rockstar Games, is nothing short of a symphony of pixels, orchestrating an exquisite ballet of chaos and consequence in the sprawling, sun-kissed canvas of Los Santos.  From the very moment one steps into the ethereal realm of GTA V, the senses are immediately ensnared by a sensory feast of visual grandeur. The opulent sunsets that bathe the cityscape in hues so vivid they seem painted by the celestial brushstrokes of a digital deity. The meticulous attention to detail, a testament to the virtuosity of the game's artisans, crafts a metropolis that breathes with a life uncannily mirroring reality.  Yet, it is not merely the aesthetic allure that propels GTA V into the echelons of gaming grandeur; it is the opulent tapestry of narrative finesse that truly sets it apart. The trio of protagonists, Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, form a trinity of diverse tales intricately interwoven, each narrative strand a sublime sonnet in the cacophonous ballad of crime and consequence. The dialogue, a linguistic ballet, is a marriage of wit and grit, a melange that elevates the narrative to operatic heights.  The open-world dynamism of GTA V is nothing short of a technological marvel, an expansive sandbox where every alley conceals a clandestine narrative and every street corner harbors the potential for mayhem. The vehicular symphony, a cacophony of roaring engines and screeching tires, becomes a visceral heartbeat pulsating through the veins of Los Santos.  Amidst this digitized ballet of chaos, the satirical genius of Rockstar Games unfurls like a velvet cloak of wit. The radio stations, an eclectic mosaic of musical genres and comedic satire, mirror the vibrant tapestry of Los Angeles, seamlessly blending the surreal with the uncomfortably familiar.  In the annals of gaming history, GTA V stands as an impenetrable colossus, a testament to the boundless potential of interactive storytelling. It is not merely a game; it is a transcendent experience, a symphony of chaos, consequence, and digital virtuosity that resonates with an indelible imprint upon the soul of the gaming connoisseur. Grand Theft Auto V is not just a title; it is a magnum opus, an opulent crown jewel in the diadem of interactive artistry.  Bad game."
"Best GTA series, I've played <3"
i like shooting bikini people
this is good gameeeee i recomend it
SPILLE FOR 3 DAGER STERIT
So much fun! yes it can get dramadic but amazing world!
"someone linked their social club account to my steam account and now i am not able to play any games made by rockstar...., how am i not protected from someone linking their account to my steam?? everytime i try to launch a rocstar game it literally refuses to let me use my own email and tries to force me to log in to that random guys email, but how can i when i dont know the password to a random persons email and i cant even see the full email becasue it is censored...."
I have been playing this game since a long time and I am still playing it. one of the best game to play. never bores you.

GREAT MASTERPIECE BY ROCKSTAR .
"ITS BEEN LONG TIME  I AM PLAYING THIS GAME. IT IS FABULOUSLY DESIGNED GAME WITH HIGH GRAPHICS AND REALISM. IT IS WORTH TO PLAY THIS GAME. FROM CHILDHOOD GTA IS ONE OF THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE. ITS CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT AND ADDED NEW FEATURES , MISSIONS, MAPS, ACTIVITIES WITH TRUE REALISM MAKES ME FEEL EXCITED EVERY TIME. EVERY ONE SHOULD PLAY THIS FABULOUS GAME. I LOVE GTA."
try this gta v game one time
Play GTA before you talk to me.
dont even let me play the game
VERY GOOOOOOOD #FIVEM
this is the first time i see the high heel shop this excited
good grapihcs
THIS GAME SUCKS I SPENT SO MUCH ON IT FOR IT TO NOT EVEN OPEN
It's fun to play
"So, what to say? I LOVE THIS GAME, its like playing three games in one Game. First, there is GTA 5 online: You can chat with players and complete Heists, Missions and Robberies. You can play in an open World, big as two cities.  Then, there is Gta Story Mode. The varied Stories of the three different characters are breathtaking and adventurous. I have only got 38 hours in, but im excited to play more, as I am only at 19 percent. At last, there are different Events, like Haunted Halloween or In-Game-Events, like Junk-Energy Motorcycle Events. So you have like Racing, Shooting, Robbing, and multiplayer in just one game. I highly recommend this Game for people, who dont know where to spend their money next, and who cant decide on Ego-Shooter, Racing, and Action Heists or Robberies. So, feel free to buy it. THX"
ts cold af
sexy game'
"I had this on Epic Games already, but I bought it again on steam because steam is better."

made me racist
"if you didn't play this game on the 360/ps3 as a kid and are thinking about using your newly acquired adult money to try it out then by all means please do so. i've put about 300 hrs both on a non-steam version and console versions combined, online is p shit on pc but honestly its worth it. genuinely a good game with a good development of the characters within it and it's still on par with gta iv and gta san andreas for me"
well made game i just like it.
controls still clunky as hell. literally just had a property mission become unavailable the second i showed up on site after having the taxi drop me off at the wrong spot and trying to use the clunky controls trying to drive up to the spot. why is the taxi an option if it doesn't do what it's supposed to do? i get its an old game but come on
IT IS A GOOD GAME
I have never played a game so completely infested with hackers as GTA. It is absolutely inexcusable for a game to be this popular and put such little effort into curbing the rampant hacking. I don't understand how they can continue to sell the product and shark cards while providing such a horrible user experience.  Do not play this game on PC unless you plan to play in a private lobby with just your friends. Do not listen to the people claiming you can just kill the hackers until they leave as they have multiple ways to hide who they are.   Play the game on console where they actually curb the cheating.
gta6gta6gta6gta6gta6gta6gta6gta6gta6 like this so that when you come back to this 9 years from now it'll seem like gta6 went by like a flash
"At some point, my social club got linked to the wrong email address. Anyway, I tried resetting it and tried everything to allow my social club to log in but because it never would, I couldn't play the game. So stupid. It won't even let you play normal GTA."
great game i love how the consoole skills transfer over to pc and i poop on wanna be modder tryuhards
ITS VERY VERY GOOD GAME IN GAME INDUSTERY
Play it. It's worth the investment
I love this game. Trevor is so hot
"Good game aside from all the modders and hackers, occasionally get banned for nothing like i did"
"war crimes are allowed, i recommend"
amazing game but gta online is mid
online modders
YES.
"Rockstar... please don't let us down with GTA VI. This game is a solid 9/10, it itches every single thing a GTA player could ever ask for.  Fast paced action around every corner if you so wish. Shoot up everyone with any weapon you could imagine, get yourself wanted, take any car you could dream of and drive around like a maniac, go to the stripclup and enjoy the *cough* or, you know... just take a walk and enjoy the sceneries. Up to you."
For the deal they are throwing out there if you don't have it buy it immediately. just bought to start playing on modded servers
Been out for damn near a decade and still has bugs that completely break missions come on rockstar.
Open World
good game since 2013
yes im best
"prostitutes, good stuff."

"well, pretty much coding sux for gta 5, dev's don't know how to run game, get me in there as mod/admin  On the bright side of things, 999 slot servers now thanks to fivem, only took about 16 years /   can't wait for gta 6 ? right guys ? go joe !   hope better coding next time    - nostradomas"
188+++ fps and random stuttering with top high end PC

"I personally like the single player story, but online is just a wasteland. Everything takes 2000 years to grind for and it is just a time sink. And there are SO many microtransactions. Also RDR2 made me realized how overrated this game is. That game has a far better developed story imo and it does not get a fraction of the attention that GTA V does. GTA V is not bad by any means and this game was a milestone at the time it was made, but I still feel that this game gets far too much praise. I will likely finish the story campaign but that is about all I will likely do in this game. The reason I am giving this a negative review is because most of the content in this game is on GTA online and you already know my opinion on that. Feel free to disagree with me on all of this, but this game is just not for me. I am not saying the game is bad, but online needs to seriously be fixed with all of the hacking, excessive grinding, etc."
it really really good
the theft of autos was V grand idk
Recommend the game to people
"The game works well on the Steam Deck, whoever wants to play this on the Steam Deck will be suprised with how you can ramp the settings up to high and still have 30 fps or higher"
Remove hackers and modders and this game is good
i am 68 years old and have been playing GTA since it 1st came out. I usually play with friends my age and we have many ways of playing the game but always in the INVITE ONLY as we were tired of dealing with younger players that only wanted to kill other players. We take turns doing missions together and do all the deliveries as a team.
poo poo stinky fart
yeaaaaaaaaaa
"Pretty fun i guess story is fun, online is pretty unplayable in the modern age but fun i guess"
The game is fantastic. I think everything should be accessible from the start. The buildings should be accessible at least.
Let me get those h0()k3r$
"The only thing that's missing is the smell of gunpowder, blood and burning flesh."
this game has the best strip club
"I played the game since it came out on all platforms by now, Waiting for gta six!!"
there is a reason this is one of the best selling games of all time
"A damn car fell from the sky right into my leg, i had to go to a hospital i had to pay 5000 dollars to the hospital then i walked to the road in front of the hospital when i saw a truck coming it was to late, the dude ran over me then got to hospital again!!! This infernal cicle kept going for like 5 days. After all that i went home and i got GTA 5 to play. Anyways cool game."
its a good and cool game but not a game for kids
just love
enjoy like an a reallife
I went to buy some jordans i ended up getting two womens
awesomeee noice great game
i have thefted the grand auto
Its worth the money and the six hours it takes to download
most game of all time
"Diverse missions, very fun to play heists, many vehicles, but the game is sometimes glitchy"
Entertaining game once you have the ryan gosling car.
its cool boobies
"Great game even after all these years. 100%  recommend, hands done one of the Greats."
Absolutely my childhood
hey its may help you to get relax...
not start
sukses
I love having sex on FiveM
Master piece.
i would recommend. Always good to play some GTA 5.
this is a very good the best thing is the graphics and the bad thing is that when i don't want to do missions it just force to do and that realy annoys me
"yes, because im enjoying the game and i love it and i recommend this game to the other players/streamers i promise you gonna have fun thats all. :>>"
hard to get board and very fun playing online or story
Pirated the base game 6 months ago and it worked like a charm. Bought it for the first time and crashes after 10 mins.  10/10 True Rockstar Games Experience.
for you

"its a blur of login, get in a session with a modder, get 1 million for free, modder leaves, a level 3000 incel with his mk2 comes and deletes you, rinse and repeat"
"Genuinely baffling that this game makes any money at this point. I am grateful that it doesn't launch for me anymore. Any criticism I can give has been said already. If you want to get into this game, do heroin instead. Literally do heroin or start gambling if you want the GTA online experience. You will gain more from doing doing heroin than playing GTA online. I would rather have both my arms and legs blown off by an IED in Ukraine than play this game again. Can't wait for GTA VI baby"
NICE GAME I REALLY LOVE THIS ONE.
"God awful, I hate how grindy GTA online and story mode is. Point A to Point B all the time.  Anyways, I recommend."
this game is very good
"I love this game but the hackers are sometime so irritating, if I ignored those hackers then this is the best open world game and also the most playing game in my library."
guchi
orayt
"no- this is due to my single player getting randomly corrupted, other than that its alright"
Just recommended game and bought so many copies of the game. Will buy more 6 copies when Gta 6 comes out
"Best piece of advice?   Kosatka.   Grind as much as you can to get one, then watch speedruns on how to do the heist. Then watch the mulah come in like a tranny on onlyfans. ""Ehh its hard to grind 2 million bucks"" Do odd jobs, join other heists, do whatever promo Rockstar has just get that Submarine. Trust me its worth it.   Review-wise, there's alotta cheaters/modders with mod menus but just go into passive mode or change server they won't bother you. Some modders will even help you out in heists or events so I can't complain. Dont take PVP seriously you won't gain anything from it. Take note, purchasing a car is GRINDY AF.   For reference. Average Low Level Heist Payout: 300k-500k Bootleg Toyota Supra: Around 790k"
very good game ever  i play this game ever
I am at peace every times i ignite the NPCs that honked at me :')
amazng
Hackers are out of control right now. Makes a lot of sessions almost unplayable.
I mean.... how many times have you bought it? i don't think i need to recommend it.
"no shit its good, its gta 5 lol"
this game balls
Rags to riches
everything great about  this game
ainda irei jogar com a bibi
MMKR
I love this game 😍
been addicted to this game since release
i bash my head into a wall when i die. I love it.
IF THE INVITES WORKED LIKE THEY DID LAST YEAR BEFORE ALL THE UPDATES.SO OTHER PEOPLE CAN JOIN GAMES OTHER CREATORS MAKE TO PLAY AND HAVE FUN I WAS MORE FUN BACK THEN NOW JUST MODDERS IN EVERY LOBBY NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY ANYMORE..BECAUSE OF MODDERS...SAD.......
rather splendid if i do say so myself.

Cheater/hackers everywhere. Having to deal with other people who can actually attack your game and make it crash or unable to start is horrible. Don't waste your time with this.

"Absolutely abysmal/nonexistant customer service.   I cannot play my own, legally purchased game because I once was forced to sign up for the ""social club"" years ago on an email address that no longer exists. There is no customer service phone number (there is, but it's literally a recording to tell you to go through the website).   There is no live chat. You have to go through these categories to even let it let you contact customer support via email. They did finally respond to my request about a day and a half later, then asked me to confirm I wanted to proceed, and now it's been 2 more days and I still haven't heard back.   I just want to play a single player game. That I own. I don't want anything to do with any online anything with this game. I just wanted to run over some hookers in 4k on my day off.   This is the most cowardly customer service system I have ever seen."
iam like it    its fun like good

Great game it kinda makes me wanna nut in a but for a buck and loose all luck then call tuck to get the truck so i can fuck a latina in the butt then i use my crutch to get a bunch of lunch to sponge

"GTA 5 is the game of all times. Me personally with 515 hours can say that it is one of, if not the best game i have played it resembles real life so much yet it is so fun that it is mind blowing to say such a masterpiece is bad i recommend this game to everyone. And i cant wait to play even more, so if you are thinking about playing it u dont have to think any longer u should 100% play it. The online mode is full of fun missions and heists that are very fun solo and even funner with friends. in one word the game is just amazing."
"good game, thats all i have to say!"
"Screaming ten year olds with flying missile machines ruined the game. Oh, and it makes you install a rockstar launcher on your computer. Hard pass, steam or nothing."
"This is GTA, everyone knows about it."
erm its not good everybody is bad

I like it beacase it gives you a nice feeling when you play
No Words ( THE BEST GAME EVER ! )

THIS GAME IS EXCELLENYT

great game with drugos
"Honestly, it's a fun game. I find GTA Online enjoyable. I've spent enough time to rack up millions and still have fun without getting bored, friends are fun to have and coordinate heists with. don't want to deal with griefers? just go into invite-only, Do need money and a new car? complete Dax's story hell you even get a business that you can start with the money you make. I'm honestly skimming over so much but that's just because of how much content there is to do and see, it might get boring after being poor but do not for the love of god spend real money on this game besides buying it just watch Rags To Riches from TGG. I hope this helped you make an educated purchase on the GTA Online aspect.  As far as story goes its a must play, like all Rockstar games stories the story is well crafted and made worth playing with multiple endings."
BESTEST GAME OF ALL TYM

Best Game For Me And Alot More Pepoel

"meh.  -if you played any previous gta, you'll find nothing new or interesting here except for graphical fidelity. -It has the absolutely worst  cast in any gta. They are nothing but a bunch of morons constantly yelling at each other. -gta online is  loading screen simulator. -f*ck rockstar social club."
"Very fun, many hackor, bad anitcheat, i like gta :D gta 6 going to being fun :)"

"What can you say, it's GTA5!   It's so easy to get immersed in this world.  Hours go by and you don't even realize it.  Not other game like it to date."
"I bought this game twice, TWICE and I am still getting the ""Rockstar Activation Code already in use"" error message. Such bullshit 🤬👎"
this game is poorly optimised
Honestly one of the most iconic games of all time. It does take up a lot of storage buts its a hell lot of fun. Penis.
Online of GTA V is amazing offline is good too but not as much good as online is
this game is really realistic and fun to play with friends
wear GTA 6 ?
very good shot drive fly
cool game 100 stars
waited 10 yrs to play it
"its good, but full of modders for online mode"
What in the actual FUCK ROCKSTAR. I bought this game and YOU logged me out of my social club account and now I CAN'T play it. What the fuck is wrong with companies that think this shit is O FUCKING KAY.
XoFF
Family Friendly fun for everyone!
Played 7 days worth of this game on PS4 just to find out they got rid of the ability to transfer your online character from console to PC... Rock Star just loves money more than its players I guess.
i got agirl in mycar and she is what bobbing head no music playying  what ?

There are two sides to Grand Theft Auto Five/V  1. FiveM very strict roleplay servers where even breathing at anything but x³+y³+z³=k will get you banned  2. Grand Theft Auto V

good sotory
"awesome game, i love it."
its fun and you can shoot old people in the head with guns.  not just old people though. everyone.  i recommend the owners add kids and babies to the game so i can shoot them with an rpg or kidnap them
fun and nice people :)
GTA 6 TRAILER IN 1 MONTH LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Fucking great game!!!
"its GTA, we all know it. it has a fun and interest campain and a fun and stupid online mode."
LIKE
This is a really good game but needs to add more police cars only  one type of police car there is
I found the controls difficult. There is some coarse language but story seems intriguing. I will be trying the game at a later date.
very good game but sadly gta6 is coming out annd no one will play the gta 5 anyome
Can't wait for GTA 6
Just play online in closed friend session or invite only.
this game has given me one of the best memories
it`s fun?

"Fun and really well made, but the cayo nerfs suck"
no new gen
best game for open world and really fun like 100 games combined
the game was awsm
I like the game itself however playing online is risky lots of  moders online and the social club bugs it can't establish connection which is driving me crazy however the rest is amazing
"Love playing Grand Theft Auto games. especially Grand Theft Auto 5. This game is by far the best game I've actually played on PC yet. It runs on my ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 without any issues. The only problem I have with this game is that how overwhelmingly difficult the missions are. But overall, from a scale from 1/10.. I'll rate this game a 10/10.. This game has awesome graphics and is has very realistic game play than any other Grand Theft Auto game I played yet. This is such a improvement from Grand Theft Auto 4. Thank you Rockstar games for bring this game to the table and offering more fun ways to play. I recommend this game 100%....."
giggity
Best  game i have ever playuerd
vvvvvvvv
one of the best games ever played man i tell you the custom mods are fukin AWESOME
i like the shoes store
its a fun and good game im probly gonna play it a lot more so yeah i recomend your play this game
"this needs so much updating. needing more than two players for a heist or mission is ridiculous because it takes longer than 20 minutes to get random players to join which makes the game frustrating as fuck. when you do get matched, it's somebody hacking and killing teammates for no reason. thanks rockstar! you can suck my big fat hairy balls for that one. there's no option to choose a switch controller (really awesome when you can't figure out controls for flying), third person controls are beyond fucked up (trying to use a ladder? go fuck yourself), and taking away the cows was a massive punch in the dick. WAA WAA WE DON'T WANT PLAYERS PUNCHING COWS TO MAX OUT STRENGTH WAAA WE HATE OUR PLAYERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - rockstar. thanks for coming to my ted talk. fuck this game imma keep playing until i kill myself tho"
ITS GOOD WITH MODS
This is the most best game in the World GOAT. I belive this game doest need any reviews just go for it. Waiting for GTA 6
"Although not my favorite in the series but a solid entry which can easily bring you hours on end of enjoy be it on custom servers, modded, or just a regular singleplayer playthrough."
Good Game..
i love this game so fun
Best gta game ive played now to Trry GTA VI
"90% of the buildings are not enter-able, the cars are not realistic enough, bullets go through car door metal this game isn't realistic enough. As for online, if I wanted to play forklift driving simulator I'd just go get a forklift job. GTA 4 had better car physics and rag doll physics, the modding community is toxic and the rp players are nitpicks that never seem to go outside. Other than that OK game. The good thing about this game is the story. Online just sucks."

Great stress relief!
It is a very fun game. It is one of the most realistic video games I have ever played.

"Absolutely phenomenal story. Amazing characters and character development and the greatest sense of humor from the developers, 10/10 greatest game I've ever played. Can't wait for GTA6."

No  need  any  coment .. is  a  GTA  series ..  4 real  a  GAME
"The game is great and all, but their support (Rockstar Support) is absolute shit. Horrible customer service all together."
half of my hours in this game were spent loading into it
on gilbert
its fun vary fun
I hate myself 100000/10
best part is the free murders!!!
single player
Bully innocent civilians  Downside lots of modders/hackers
VERY COOL
ghbfhtrfyjhtyhtytyt6t65tyu
Sadism.
"It's a really nice game with good graphics. Community isn't that ""toxic"" as they say it is. Yeah there are some cheaters but it's fine u can always go to another server. ""GTA 6"" trailer just got announced im so excited for it."
"It's GTA 5, who doesn't like it."
modern day age pew pew haha
Its a cool classic game that everyone knows and loves.
"game is unplayable if you're looking to play public online, it's ruined by a bunch of lifeless nerds that call themselves ""modders"" cus cheater sounds too bad for them. game has been out for a decade and to this day rockstar has done completely nothing about it. for a game that's been out for this long the content is pretty lacking and updates very minimal. they only care about profit which is why they nerf the shit out of certain heists so you can't gain as much and increase the prices on cars by millions just so the stupid people support this horrible company and buy the overpriced shark cards that are not worth the money in the slightest. the only way i find this game fun is playing story or only in private lobbies with friends since online is pretty boring solo and rockstar pretty much is against solo since there's barely any solo content."
this game ******* sucks
THE GAME WON'T START
I don't understand the hype around this game. After 4 hours I feel like I've seen most of what's to offer in this game and it's sad. Vice City was a better game and it was over a decade ago. The character swap feature is lost on me as I'd rather have a character who better represents me than swapping between all these annoying characters
Still one of the best games ever
What an incredible game! I grew up with it and definitely blown away by how far its all come.
gta online is the thing i play
"Its full of hackers, almost unplayable. for those who play the game legit, and have purchased money in the game it show the lack of care by rockstar not  to crackdown on hacking."
"So many bug, i hope rockstar can fixed!"
nostalgic game
uyddfghjklkjhgfds
"This game is a petri dish for toxic players. Rockstar had a good idea behind the game, but their developers let it evolve into a sess pool of modders/cheaters. Instead of fixing the backdoors and exploits or addressing the blatant issues, the developers--at most--""ban"" the players. Then the banned players can simply buy another account for like $10 US and do it all over again. The fact that modders/cheaters can block your in-game reporting (and get a notification that YOU tried to do so) speaks for itself... pathetic"
yeahhhhhhhhh ts pretty good
its very good but i edge to trevor
".,xybhfšioDSŠNglsšWD<"
the game wont launch on my pc
Kifflom
w game much like
i made money hack on online my dad is proud of me
Wonderful game!
story mode is awsome.  but online on a other hand. it is difficult to be in a public lobby. it is but it is fun. specially with friends
smridljivkoooo
Plane go kaboom
"This Game is Amazingly Good with mods in story mode , I REALLY RECOMMEND IT"
highest replay value ever for a game.  amazing
it is one of the best games i ever palyed you should buy this game
"Where is story mode dlc ☹️ Glad  I never spent a cent on shark cards, even though most of the vehicles require copius amounts of grinding, which is why I stopped playing online. Yet the story mode is good, not perfect, but good, and memorable. Just wish Rockstar put some effort in single player dlc rather than packaging it with gta online, like the The Contract where you got to see Franklin and Lamar years in the future."
They have deleted my account and now i can not log in. I wasn't even modding just casual play but they fucked it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"It says i have 20 hrs, but really 6 of them are me trying to get it to work. It worked the first few days and then ive spent the past year just trying to get it to launch. Ive tried every solution available including formatting my pc and reinstalling windows. no help."
Still great after all these years!
only good to run RP servers on pc tbh
Rockstar launcher says my steam is linked to another social account and that I can't play without signing into rockstar launcher. This alone deserves a negative review. Can't play a game I paid for because of your **** launcher.
good game. make things explode. 10/10 would recommend.

Hello There
good game fantastic graphics and realistic experiences like it!
rockstar milks the shit out of this game online is fucking bugged infested with cockroach griefers and now gta+ wtf
ONE-OF-A-KIND
"Hell no, fucking trash. I don't know who was in charge of UX/UI design for this game but they are a MASSIVE FUCKING RETARD. Like seriously they must share brain cells with a chimpanzee, the UX in this game is so ass. Why tf do I need to double-click every fucking button to confirm my selection? Are these devs retarded, like yes I clicked the fucking button just do the fucking thing... why tf do I need to use the arrow keys to select different options? why tf does it use a custom mouse pointer that's so fucking sluggish it's gay? WHY TF DID IT MAKE ME DO THE TRASH TUTORIAL BEFORE I COULD PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS AND IT DOESN'T LET YOU QUIT THE TUTORIAL AFTER STARTING IT?? REALLY??? And fuck me every time I want to quit a mission I have to go through 3 layers of dialog boxes... like nigga... just let me quit the fucking mission already... Controls are wack af, like really?... 'Q' is the default for hiding behind cover? what kind of retarded shit is that? Scroll opens up a goddamn wheel menu? what the cock?!? Walking/Sprinting feels weird, I don't know why, but somehow they managed to fuck that up. Driving is retarded, I briefly hit the spacebar and my car goes flying off like some turd in the wind. I could go on and on with all the retardisms in this game. I ended up uninstalling it after an hour and a half before I could discover any more. I just can't deal with its stupidity. If I knew they would set the bar as low as hiring complete RETARDS for the UX design I would've taken the job myself and done a better job goddamn. Hope whoever was UX lead for this game chokes on a walnut, and the hats off to the product owner for allowing this shit to go through. Enjoy my fucking $20 wasted you dumb hoes."
!!!
sheesh
"Runs faster than Minecraft. Keep in mind, this game hardly runs at all. My PC sucks."

"I can't play the game (story mode) bcz it wants me to authenticate somewhere, while my internet connection is dead. I connected to someone's wifi to just write this review and try to authenticate, but anyways the game is not working! It failed to connect to rockstar games launcher but launched the game itself after few minutes, got into story mode and said that I need to join their social club for god knows what fkn reason. Can't wait to get internet  back and play something online. GTA V single mod sucks BCZ IT NEEDS INTERNET!!!!"
great games
this game is so much fun i rate this a 10/10 dont think the game is bad because the missions are hard but when u finish u get to do what ever u want u finnaly get sandbox but sandbox u still have the cops
closed the game but i could still hear gunshots  10/10
"Gta V is an amazing game. Excellent game to play with friends or family  However !!! -> Since day one peoples are cheating and still do on every online server there are alot of those players that use scripts & hacking tools and they don't get banned ( They use god mode, They can spawn random explosions around the map, teleporting into your car and out or teleporting you to places, they never get banned or kicked off the game, you can see them on every online session or a mission. they will ruin your missions and fun and cause you to get banned like they did to me and if ""you"" interrupt them in their stuff they just hack/mod your character to get banned.  So you can actually only play online in a closed session limited to so little content you can do but missions require most of the time 4 peoples so get your friends or don't enjoy any of that content or risk on getting banned.  It's not that the game is stable, it crashes every now and then to desktop when you try to do a mission or other activity than just roaming around doing the same things in the world.  So while going to lobby it pop you out of online mode sometimes you end in desktop for no reason, so let's accuse the lobbies :D but nope this is rockstar to be blamed for bad servicing...  Well logging in and out of sessions is taking like 2-4 min on a high speed broadband without using a proxy to improve connection issues... like what the hell this is not a dial up service ??? and eventualy you sometimes get an error message that you cannot join your friend or the session cannot be found. if you are lucky it just load forever - look at your screen for minutes and nothing happens. okey let's try again lol.  Well i'm not sad Rockstar is banning legit players, they already lost most of their playerbase. So i'm happy because they just save us a lot of time trying to play a broken game... It's hard to change bad habits of players and us the casual gamers - we are sick and tired of it.  Let's least hope GTA 6 does it different (Trailer in December)...  Rockstar i'm not blaming you but seriously after 10 years you could have made a change and done ""us"" players a better service and not this horrible mess!  It's a fact that there's hardly any mission running open on online sessions + all the spam messages coming in your ""HOME"" online service menu proves that YOU are the one that should be Frustrated and not US. So goodluck working on that and thanks for saving me time o/ see ya, probably not because All Decisions and Reviews are Final."
Is gta 5 gta 5 good is yes
thanks for the best game ever

"yes, wish I could figure out the online character transfer tho."
"This game is the essential lyric meaning of art, it’s over the known of whatever you’ve played before, making the conjecture of the graphics, text, narrative, critics and ideas unique and perfect to every human being whose allow themselves to embrace such work of art. I’m commenting it today because of the trailer announcement of the next GTA, this will remind me of all the feelings and impressions that I had of this game that was with me since released. Salute to all of this grate passionate community of gta. I hope we all know what this is about… F ck you"
Game is large and immersive.  Plenty of action and things to accomplish.  Multiplayer could use some adult supervision.
Unbelievable achievement in game-making. Industry defining game for the decade that followed its release. Buy it.
"game is always crashing on me. can you fix my problem please, i don't feel like i'm the only one with this situation"
grand theft auto v is good
"gta online sucks, the rest of the gta 5 is amazing but rockstar puts no effort into making gta online a good experience."
This game is very fun with friends as long as your friends arnt ignorant and anoying

W game but i'll be dead before the 6th one comes out

"A True Masterpiece, but Player Behavior Can Be a Challenge  Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  Grand Theft Auto V is nothing short of a gaming masterpiece. Rockstar has crafted an open-world experience like no other, with a sprawling, vibrant city to explore, an engaging story to follow, and endless opportunities for mayhem and adventure. The attention to detail and the sheer scale of the game world are truly remarkable.  However, the only downside I've encountered in my time with GTA V is the behavior of some players in the online mode. While the game itself is a work of art, the online community can sometimes be a bit challenging. You might encounter griefers, trolls, or hackers from time to time, which can be frustrating when you're trying to enjoy the game.  That being said, I don't think this issue should detract from the game's overall rating. It's more a reflection of the online gaming environment in general, rather than a fault of GTA V itself. Rockstar has implemented various measures to combat these issues, and there are many fantastic players and communities within the game as well.  If you can look past the occasional troublesome player and focus on the incredible content and experiences GTA V offers, you're in for an unforgettable gaming journey. Whether you're into the story mode or the vast online world, GTA V has something for everyone. It's a game that continues to stand the test of time, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an immersive, action-packed adventure."
godddddddddddddd
THEY PUT INFLATION INTO A VIDEO GAME!  PYROCYNICAL NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this game is fun with friends and u can laugh all day long
hackers ruin this game
"Graphics are not spectacular, amazing story, fun to play 4/5"
"If you were like me, (a PC user whom used to play GTA V online on PS/Xbox), and kinda wanted to hop online to see some of the neat cool vehicles the online game has added, while visiting your garage full of awesome rides you used to enjoy... DON'T waste your money!  For whatever reason, Rockstar STOPPED supporting online character transfers apparently sometime in 2017.  Fuck you, Rockstar."
corrupted government
10 years later and still outshines a lot of what's coming out now

What can I say about the game that hasn't already been said?
Its good but the opressor is annoying but its fun a bit offensive and ALOT of blood

TAKES AGES TO LOAD BUT WHEN IT DOES LOAD ITS FUN
Best game ever(2023)
IT Grand Theft Auto what are you thinking about
"unless you're willing to spend money on a mod menu from some undisclosed source this game is unplayable online. If you just want it to fuck around in the story mode then I can maybe recommend it but it is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY GTA ONLINE WITHOUT CHEATING. every single lobby you will join will have at least 10 cheaters and probably more, so good luck trying to do something like sell stocks from your businesses because you'll probably get killed by some 15 year old with god mode or some schmuck on a flying bike. absolute shit"
when i play this game it gives me a sensation running through my entire body. its like fucking a lesbian and making her turn straight!
Ladies and gentlemen.. GTA VI has been announced.

"Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is nothing short of a modern gaming masterpiece. Released in 2013, it has continued to captivate players with its vast open world, immersive storyline, and an unprecedented level of detail that has set a benchmark for the industry.  The most striking aspect of GTA V is its sprawling, fictional city of Los Santos, a stunning and meticulously crafted representation of a modern metropolis. It's teeming with life, from the busy streets to the serene countryside, and you'll find yourself getting lost in the sheer size and detail of the game world. Whether it's a leisurely drive along the scenic coast, an adrenaline-pumping chase through downtown, or an unexpected encounter with the local wildlife in the wilderness, every moment in Los Santos feels like an adventure.  The game's narrative is equally compelling, with three distinct protagonists, Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, each offering a unique perspective and personality. The storytelling is top-notch, weaving a tale of crime, betrayal, and redemption, and it keeps you engaged from start to finish. The characters are well-developed, and the voice acting is superb, enhancing the overall experience.  GTA V's gameplay is a testament to Rockstar's commitment to excellence. It seamlessly blends action, exploration, and driving mechanics, offering a wide variety of activities, from heists to tennis matches, ensuring there's always something to do. The game's gunplay and driving mechanics are polished and satisfying, providing an enjoyable experience for both casual and hardcore gamers.  Moreover, GTA Online, the multiplayer component of the game, extends the fun beyond the single-player campaign. It allows you to explore Los Santos with friends, engage in various missions, or simply create chaos in the sandbox environment. The constant updates and additions have kept the online community engaged for years.  Graphically, GTA V was groundbreaking when it first came out, and it still holds up well today. The attention to detail in the world design, character models, and vehicle physics is outstanding. With the option to play in first-person view, you can immerse yourself even further into the world of Los Santos.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a timeless classic in the world of gaming. It's a game that's not just about entertainment; it's an experience. Even years after its release, it continues to attract new players and retains a dedicated fan base. If you haven't experienced the magic of Los Santos and the engaging narrative of GTA V, you're missing out on one of the most iconic and enjoyable gaming experiences of this generation. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the franchise, GTA V is a must-play title that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on you."
"""Grand Theft Auto: Where Mayhem Meets Satirical Brilliance""  Introduction: Ah, Grand Theft Auto (GTA), the virtual playground where chaos and satire hold hands, skip down the street, and then promptly steal a car. This iconic video game series has been a source of endless entertainment and controversy, offering players a morally questionable, yet undeniably captivating sandbox to explore. So, let's take a joyride through the twisted streets of GTA and examine what makes it a modern gaming legend.  Graphics: The graphics in GTA are so realistic that if you stare at the screen long enough, you'll start to wonder if you should pay rent for your in-game apartment. From the meticulously detailed urban landscapes to the awe-inspiring sunsets, GTA's graphics are so beautiful that even Mother Nature would be a little envious. Just don't be surprised if you end up admiring the virtual world more than your actual surroundings.  Gameplay: GTA's gameplay is like a bizarre mix of a circus act and a Choose Your Own Adventure novel. You can drive a tank through a shopping mall, steal a jet, or just cruise around listening to some funky radio tunes while evading the police. The game's open-world environment is a never-ending amusement park, where you're free to choose your own wild ride. It's like Disney World, except with more guns and fewer mouse ears.  Storyline: While GTA's narrative isn't exactly Shakespearean in its depth, it's like a cheesy B-movie script that you can't help but love. You play as a character who is almost always morally ambiguous, and you'll find yourself embroiled in various criminal activities that would make even Tony Montana blush. The plot twists are often about as subtle as a sledgehammer, but they are so over-the-top that you can't help but be entertained. It's a bit like watching a soap opera, but with more explosions and fewer evil twins.  Characters: GTA has given us some of the most memorable characters in the gaming world. From the lovable psychopath Trevor Phillips to the suave and stylish Nico Bellic, you'll encounter a cast of characters who are as diverse as they are entertaining. The game excels at creating antiheroes you can't help but root for, despite their many, many flaws. It's like a gathering of your weirdest, wildest, and most unhinged friends at a never-ending house party.  Satire: One of the defining features of GTA is its biting social commentary and satirical humor. The in-game radio stations and commercials offer a hilarious, exaggerated take on American culture, politics, and consumerism. It's like a Saturday Night Live skit on steroids, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all. GTA's satire doesn't just poke fun at society; it skewers it, roasts it, and serves it with a side of chaos.  Conclusion: Grand Theft Auto is not just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon. It's a virtual playground where you can unleash your inner anarchist, all while poking fun at the absurdities of the real world. Sure, it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're looking for an irreverent, action-packed, and often hilarious gaming experience, GTA is the ride you've been waiting for. Just remember to leave your moral compass at the door and your inhibitions in the real world. In GTA, anything goes, and that's precisely what makes it so outrageously, addictively fun."
alot of hackers
We're in the endgame now  GTA VI was announced today

gta 6 trailer coming out in a month hype fr cyperpunk trash
"The cheating problem is completely out of hand to the point where I want a console just so I can play without someone ruining my game. It's obvious Rockstar doesn't care about PC GTA at all because any amount of effort would be an improvement over the current state of this game. Today I played for about 4 hours and got crashed or kicked on 14 different occasions, including 2 different times when I was selling special cargo, which resulted in almost 2 million GTA$ lost. I won't bother contacting Rockstar support again for reimbursement or reporting as they are completely clueless as to what their job is and copy-paste generic answers for every inquiry I've had with them over the past 8 or so years of playing GTA. The in-game report and vote-to-kick system is completely useless because the troublemakers are ALWAYS cheating, and they can just block reports and vote-kicks (not that they work in the first place.) The ratio of cheaters to normal players has to be somewhere around 1 in 4. On top of all this, the game very frequently refuses to load into Online the first, second, or maybe even third time, and I get infinite black screens or loading screens so often that even if I wasn't getting messed with constantly, I'd still have to reload the entire game about once an hour.  Now, onto the (intended) gameplay experience.  Earlier this year, Rockstar removed almost 200 vehicles from the in-game catalogue, under the guise of ""streamlining the shopping experience"" or some bullshit like that. On next-gen console, they added some sort of car club that you have to pay a monthly subscription for (yes, monthly) to get ONE free car a month and the mere opportunity to purchase some of those vehicles they took away for so-called simplicity. Of course, that hasn't been added to PC (because, again, Rockstar doesn't give a fuck about PC players) so our only option is to either cheat, which kind of ruins the game, or pray that in the next few years the car we want will finally pop up on the podium of the Diamond Casino AND we can somehow win it, or Simeon's dealership will at some point have it in stock.  Vehicle prices have also become outrageous. After modifications, I ended up paying almost 2 million dollars for some dogshit hatchback that doesn't even go fast in a straight line and doesn't turn without losing control. Most of the good affordable cars in the game of course got removed with Rockstar's cleansing efforts so unless you're willing to grind for hours upon hours for a single good car or cheat, you need to pay real money.  Shark cards are also priced the same as when they were released, and still give you the same amount of GTA$ as when they were released, which was way back in 2013. To put that in perspective, if you want the Oppressor Mk2, you'll need to shell out $100 for the bike alone. This doesn't include the price of the Nightclub AND Terrorbyte truck, the Terrorbyte vehicle workshop addon, and the price of all the modifications to the bike that make it worth using.  Solo grinding has become slightly easier over the past year or 2, especially with the addition to warehouse assistants that you pay to source things like cargo, but it's still a nightmare to make money solo, especially when you're first starting out. For things like special cargo and MC businesses, if you don't sell your stock while you have less, you'll be forced to make multiple trips in different delivery vehicles while the other ones play sitting duck and ping themselves on the map for everyone to destroy. Alternatively, you can hire associates or MC members, which sucks because as I said before, a majority of players cheat, and cheaters tend to entertain themselves with griefing. Or you'll hire someone that either leaves the session, destroys your cargo on purpose, or just doesn't help.  In short, my favorite game to absolutely fucking hate."

Still waiting for GTA6
Every lobby is infested with hackers. Rockstar is just a poor indie company that doesn't have enough income provide a decent anti-cheat. Doesn't help that their scummy in-game economy all but forces people to hack(money) if they want to be able to buy anything.

good old game
Such a good game

hhththt
"Story is kinda fun, and the multiplayer is hilarious, but it gets old fast. It's also stupid how long it takes to earn money in the game, because they want you to buy shark cards. That and the rampant cheating make this game tedious to me personally. My friend got perma banned because he was in the same server as someone using hacks, so we both removed the game from our Steam lilbraries. Tired of this crap."
good for fivm
"I'm in an endless loop, please send help."
Playing it gave me more excitement
FUCK THIS SHIT GTA 6 IS COMING OUT NEXT MONTH

this game is very good and i prefer you to buy this game from stream only
best multiplayer plus single player open world game ever .
Rockstar is a laughably bad publisher. They have for some reason decided that PC isn't worth supporting and have made features that are only available to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Mainly the 4 million they give you at the start of the game and an explanation of all the newer content. Don't play this on PC if you have a console. It is far better there and isn't overrun with mod menus and DOSsing

"Boring as hell, many modder/cheater/hacker, not worth to buy, better to wait for GTA VI"
"Aids in a bottle -  e.i crashes on startup, cant get past the ""R""  play red dead"
great game would love real life cars in here
can finally commit tax fraud legally
Multiplayer fun as hell
"SIMPLY YES, I would recommend though that you play with a friend or group of friends. There is no small amount of bullsh*ttery that can be done. It's simply peak fun."
5stars
Damn good. I like to drive around the map

One of the best game of all time. The good part is that you can do everything in this game. There is nothing bad about this everything is perfectly fine. It's kind of relaxing game. Highly recommended for all type of players.
"nice game for people who want to play this game, my favorite part is when lamar says ""Ooh he lied to me"""
"cmon now, its gta v"

this mid ash
y'all already know how it is. just play it. so good
finished it in 4 days love this game
"Immersive  and intricate story. Attention to detail. Easily one of the best games of it's time and still to date. Are there things I would change, sure. Does it fall victim to repetitive online gameplay, sometimes. HOWEVER, the sheer influence and addicting gameplay options provided by this title make it stand alone."
where the mustard at
Love running people over with me car

The best game ever!
"Absolute hollowed out swearing trash.   GTA 4 is a better game, GTA 6 will be trash just like taking a number 5."
"It's GTA and the online can be played privately. Aside from money making being extremely tedious and quite repetitive online, it's amazing. Play it now."
This game older than dust
"fuck this shit game nigga, fucking gay ass rockstar games, where the fuck is grand theft auto 6 at?? niggas making me wait since 2001, like holy shit"

"A great single player story.  I prefer GTA4's story, but not for lack of quality on GTA5.  Three protagonists were a pretty risky gamble on Rockstar's part, but it has a distinct immersion advantage over previous entries.  Trevor is right at home being the agent of chaos; feels great to rack up the wanted level as him.  Franklin embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of your typical early game and Michael acts as the unfulfilled have-it-all where all GTA protagonists end up (it's a lot like a player picking up an old save with a bunch of money, but no direction because most of the missions are done).  I had never really noticed how disjointed the main char of a GTA game was depending on my mood.  The heist structure took the best of the story missions of 4 and created fun variations of heists throughout.  Also, following a crew was a breath of fresh air in the franchise, even if in-crew relationships were not always golden throughout the story.  Weapons feel good and differentiate themselves from each other well.  Gunplay is the best it's been in the series.  Driving has the needle ever-so-slightly dialed back towards arcade-y from the weighty driving of GTA4; a good change, IMO.  Visuals have aged well.  The layout, size and diversity of San Andreas hasn't been matched in a game of this type since.  Tone is well-balanced between classic GTA absurdity, while not taking you out of the story at hand.  Money-making side content is ho-hum; par for the course.  I did enjoy the golf and tennis, which was a pleasant surprise.  I would not advise engaging meaningfully in online, even if you typically enjoy multiplayer.  It feels like it started as one big joke at the expense of pay-to-win ""modern gaming"" that became the most successful example of the same ever.  Convenient outcome for Rockstar stockholders, I'm sure.   It's a huge money sink and a quintessential griefer's paradise.  Don't pay for the privilege of being a puffer to some whale. </sermon>"
Khub Nabood Dozdi Tarvij Yaft!
my game is not opening it will stuck and crash
vgjvhvhj
can no longer play this or gta iv because of rockstar launcher.
VERY GOOD GAME MADAFAKA BUY NOW
the only fun thing in this game is whenever u join public session 100% u found a modders
itss really good!!
nice...
"I tried to come back to GTA again in November 2023. Fresh character level 1. I played for a few hours. At some point I'm sitting in my car waiting for this magnificent game to put me in any job available. Hacker spawns beside me. Fools around for a mintue and then smashes a huge pile of action figures boosting my level from 5 -> 70.  Absoultely disgusting. I dont even blame him because he is obviously a special ed kid who thinks he is giving a charity by dropping 200k and 70 levels in the process.  Anyways, I will just calmly say the same thing I said to Poopstar in my RDR2 review. DIE YOU DISGUSTING INCAPABLE THIEVEING GOBLINS! I WOULD RATHER CALL MY HOMIES AND PLAY IN A SANDBOX IN THE PARK THAN EVEN THINK OF WASTING MY TIME ON A BETA PRODUCT THAT EVEN you DONT CARE ABOUT!"
a good game and i like it with mods very good
i like running over the highway thingys
doesnt work to log into launcher on steam deck.  refunded since as of right now my pc wouldnt be able to run it.
"Always a problem, not the story but the launcher"
"So stopped playing for a while, and I guess rockstar would think it was funny or something to make my code non functional. which was a jerk move so now I cant play this stupid game good job rockstar how much are you worth? 8 BILLION DOLLARS and scamming your fans.... good on you 80 bucks btw 2 days of hard work down the drain."
"Story mode is very fun and is a good first GTA game for someone new to them, online needs work with hackers and general progression."
i got for 20 buck for premium
ihyi
Havent played GTA since Vice City... I am in love all over again GAME IS AMAZING
Valla oyun cok sıkıcı 2 saat oynadıktan sonra sıkılıyosun
game is good but need to improve grphics
DUB
The game is top but why are there so many cheats? I ask the developers to make anti-cheat normal and the game will be just bomb
Gta 5 is so fun with LSPDFR!
Recommended if you feel you like a gankster
nvgchvhgf
i recomed this game for my family and friends becuse its a good game :)
"CAYO PERICO IS BROKEN AF, NOT THE SAME AS YEAR AGO"
its good tbh
great for lspdfr
100 percent recommended
no word can describe this game
gta online 20th anniversary edition incoming
Grand theft auto v is a great game to play with friends. Always have lots of shit to do.
"Pretty good, thats about it."
very glitchy nowadays but still somehow the most fun
its good and fun
I killed a family of four.
Yes i member
Nothing to say … Just buy and Enjoy 😌
i lov eit
cmon man
a lot of grinding but oddly enjoyable
My Favourite game of all Time! >:D
game glitiched so it wont appear in the steam library now i cant delete it
You already know X-D
crime is cool and so is this game
Nothing short of the best.
"Purchased on Steam for my Deck, but can’t play cause they didn’t send me the activation code!!!!!"
"Had to start all over, not for kids, fun shooting and blowing things that could get me life in jail in real life"
nothing much to say ... download it you wont never regret it
"Realistic, almost too realistic. Ich liebe Gta5 das videospiele ist sehr gut und lebensecht."
its kinda mid
story mode yes online has hackers/modders that trap you or annoy you
"This game is decent. I especially like the part where you play as a former bank robber turned rich family man to-be-movie writer who takes a young buck under his wing and teaches him his ways, only for my uncle to discover he's still alive and comes to LA to yell at him but they rob more banks and eventually end happily and stuff. -story gets boring after a while P.S i never completed the story, too boring"
WORTH EVERY SECOND
Car
"One of the greatest video game stories of all time. Complex, layered and while at times slow, has many big payoffs in terms of story and character development."
im a pimp and have sex
liked the graphics
Everything is ridiculously overpriced and game locks up on the regular. Game has been out for ten plus years and you still can't get it right Rockstar. If this is how GT6 is (if it's ever released) you can count me out.
"Used to be a great game, came back in 2023 to play some new online content, hacker grabbed me from the casino to torture me within minutes of logging in, not worth the effort to find private servers."
graet
This game is great and well worth the purchase. Like this game highly recommend.
for sure
real hooman bin
Very fun and addicting.
bets game EVER
very good shooter game shoe store is 10/10 u get free shoe from it every kid should go tehre with there mother
we all love this game
its very fun def no ppl on g mode
y es
its a w game even better if u hack but i dont ;)
"Game wants to crash any chance it wants to especially on GTA online. if you want to do heist with friends then you'll probably have 6 out of 10 times of the game not loading the heist on all accounts, some accounts will load in but the host won't so instant reset or the assets on one account will not load and the heist will not be completed. A lot of the updates the game has mostly limit the amount of money a player can acquire in regards with the Cayo Perico heist. No bug fixes or adjustment with other heist to make players want to play everything else instead of doing the Cayo Perico heist which to date is the most efficient way to money in the game. everything else like business and bunker assignments has to be build up months in advance make a fraction of what you make in this heist. so  long story short i wouldn't,t want to recommend a game focused on making every update become more tedium then fun like it was years ago. but then again its a ten year old game and it seems all games are going this cringe direction of making more money instead of delivering a genuine fun experience to the consumer."
My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on gta v and it gets 150 likes and 50 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.
Very cool
"Interesting game to play with your girl for couple days.  Too little things to do, waiting for updates and advise you to do the same.  Graphic - 7/10 Gameplay - 8/10 Sarcasm def not in this text xD"
mod a ble
"SUPER FUN, HAS A LOT OF THINGS TO DO IN GAME! AND ITS VERY DYNAMIC"
"""u forget a thousand things everyday how about u make sure this is one of em"""
its gta lmao
I LIKE THE GAME
not work
this game is great i have been edicted
idk idk idk idk its alright i mean its good
GTA 5 online sucks. I will not be getting GTA 6
hors grenad shoe dogg
fakonmainiga
Freedom.
Not worth the trouble with resolving Social Club issues.
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  if you really want to play GTA5 buy it off the rockstar launcher. rockstars company is run by a staff with the combined iq of a fucking boulder and theyll tell you you need a ""R* activation code"" to play the game. THEY WILL NOT SUPPLY YOU WITH THIS CODE. I have been waiting 8 days for an email back just so i can play GTAO for christsakes. In short, buy this game off R* launcher or when the game FORCIBLY INSTALLS R* LAUNCHER to run, you cant play."
Classic at this point haha
"bought this just play online, I'm already rich in GTA:Online story mode I watch on youtube"
"The pinnacle of open world, with amazing gameplay and storyline along with a fantastic HUD to follow. Would recommend this game any time. Let's hope GTA 6 is announced soon enough, can't wait to see how it betters this game."
great graphic
its gta v enneh
shit game mother fuckers
grand 6 were ????
THIS SHIT ASS
it has a good gameplay i love it sadly i just finish it btw its so good
F....king Epic. Played this game a little too late. But it was still a lot of fun.. Definitely would recommend in 2023..
Played this back in 2013 on the PS4.. Playing it now on PC feels fresh!
i love clash royal levvvvvvv
"bought it for the story mode, stayed for the story mode"
i goon to gta 5.....
SUCH A NICE GAME
SUNNY LIKES IT.
very boom game play
best game to enjoy
This is probably the best game I've ever played in my entire life
amazing open world game
this game is too good
only for 18+
wonderful realistic just love it
NICE GAME DEFINATELY MADE FOR KIDS :))

"i can,t play"
Majja Agyaa
Beat game
sej
sometimes boring
"fun game, except for when the flying bikes with lock-on missiles are after you, when you're just trying to get some cash yk. Otherwise it okay i guess."
"My kids will play this game before GTA 6 gets announced.  [edit] never mind they fucking announced it a day after i made this review, why wouldn't that be the case."
Very Fun Great Online Great modding community
never get boring play
MONEY BOKARA HATHE VARE GAME HADUKO NETAMU NENU CHEPATHE CHEPA
I mean.... its aight.
I would like it if they allowed FiveM players to still play online instead of reinstalling it for the fresh copy
This game is really....  Then the skrip club....
stunt races ftw
the social club is the literal worst thing. every couple months i'll get the desire to play this game and it ends up blocking me because of the stupid social club not recognizing my email and password
"this game will west your time,but this game is good for penganguran,pengganguran"
"i rather shove steamy hot metal balls in my urethra than playing online. you're putting your personal data and your whole pc at risk for what? just to get killed by some dude with fetal alcohol syndrome with zero skill, but its able to blow you up with a pistol cause he rubbed the nipples of another 3rd world country unloved child for some cheats. for a game that makes Rockstar millions they are more useless than Mojang developers when it comes to keeping their game playable. fuck this game im gonna jack off"
GTAV is not free and if you wanted to know its about 100 GB because the map is ginormous you can go in private sessions and do singleplayer and multiplayer also the game is about idk 56 dollars
"I am the problem. I have bought this game three times on three platforms. I am delaying GTA VI, and my sorrow knows no bounds. But a game I buy three times is pretty fun, so I guess that speaks for itself."
i fucked my game lmao
"Gta is Brutallll now, borderline unplayable with the amount of modders in the lobbys. theres literally atleast one griefing modder in a lobby unless its a ghost-town. its gone in the exact same direction as the 360 version of the game, allz i wanna do is drive undisturbed and have communial interactions but its just an all out warzone with everybody on edge. edit/ uninstalled it today im done getting on to drive and people messing with my time constantly. ill play some other game where they care about their players, its honestly disgusting the state the game is in and they are tryin to hype up 6 like it wont end up with the same exact problems unless they fix it, it aint really hard for rockstar to demod gta"
It's an addiction.
i like it lot of things to do
"You forget a thousand things every day, pal. Make sure this game isn't one of them."
"never thought I'd appreciate this game as much as i do now, in 2023. Yea the grind is one of the worst... but the campaign is not a 4/10. <3"

HOLA
pls fix cocaine lockup issue
great play on laptop relatviely low graphics its non gaming works well enough 60 fps
Great game overall
Kind of fun playing single player but online is run by cheaters who teleport onto you with godmode and just 1 shot you.   This game is like 10 years old so at this point its a game feature not a bug.  Unfortunately all DLC is for gta online only and not usable in story mode.  This optimizes the amount of money they can milk off you.  The story mode is easily worth the 20$ it cost but I wouldn't pay much more than that.
"""Mom i promise, i thought it was just a shoe store!"""
"Fun, nice and friendly people except a few hackers who are annoying but still fun"
i like the shoe store big b00bies
pay to win game
"I have played this game since 2013, from xbox 360 to xbox one to PC, overall I enjoy the game, at least enough to play it for 10 years, can't say that with many games, the one big downside is GTA Online, I play online regularly on console but PC it is almost impossible to have a normal game without a modder coming and ruining everything, overall I would highly recommend the story mode of this game but if you want to play online avoid the PC version and play the online mode on console otherwise you will have people with small pps trying to over compensate with their mod menus"
i love but for goodness sake release gta 6 already.
it works good on pc
kjhgfvbnjkoiuytrfghjkouytfc
good ggame
rat poison
WAS A great game but what's the point of paying for Shark Cash when every server has people cheating so much you can't do anything unless your on a server alone. You can report cheaters all day Rockstar doesn't care. single player is fun but everything online has become nothing more then a cash grab.
BIG SEX
I love that im able to do almost everything in the game.
the cars are cool
Driving and Shooting
good because LSPD:FR bad because too many toxic kids
vroom gun sexz
what i like about the game is that there is no ads
i need to play
bloody brilliant!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My friend who I play CS:GO with said if I post a review on this game and it gets 200 likes and 200 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 3060 and 2 Kilos of canned ham . So I'm just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha

"Open world, You can download mods like, lspdfr to be a cop to make it more immersive and etc. Very kool"
one of the best game i loved it.
Simply put.... The BEST video game ever made in my opinion. Hours and hours of adventures and hell raising fun. This should be a must have game for all. The only video game that I feel that I have received above and beyond what I paid for.
this is best game ever i liked
"The game world itself is fun. It's very entertaining to just drive around and shoot stuff and get into chases and crash frequently, you know, just regular old open world fun. The story itself is full of edgy adult content that doesn't really do anything enjoyable. And online is... well, it's just not that great. Hackers and MTX abound, the game doesn't respect your time, and the networking is god-awful. I mean, you want to fire it up and play a bit and it will make you wait. for. five. entire. minutes. just to load into a server. Once you're on it's mostly serviceable. I don't think it's worth your time investment. And heaven help you if you need anything from Rockstar Support, perhaps the most useless people in the whole industry. There's also a launcher, and it sucks."

"Gta V: Online, which is the part of GTA that you would come back to after being bored of singleplayer, is trash. You either do jobs in a lone, or coop setting which is boring, or get blasted by a flying bike, by someone who paid 50$ dollars for it. GJ Rockstar, you made all your additions to multiplayer totally unnecessary."
it is not bad
"once you play GTA V, you'll never leave the house 💯"
"Very good. I played it on xbox for like over 4-5 years just in story mode and I didn't get bored. Now I bought a PC and wanted to play RP, but I have a problem with fivem so I can't play RP. My friends bought it and now we play online togather. Even they have more levels bc of grinding, I am the one who is a veteran, know the map,shortcuts and many more. I really recommend it."
This game is so cool and have very realistic graphics
gdggghdfcdytcfdytgvgthyjd
sucks because they dont do anything to the hackers that sit there and grief lobbies to unplayable levels. or how they can just push everyone from servers at once is pretty cool too. not to mention trying to get into server in general is a full time job
w game!!
Remarkably Mid
kinda sucks bought the game only for the given key for rock stars social account to cock block me and not accept the key steam game me.  just wanted to play it on PC because i really missed it when i had a ps4.  this shit is stupid as hell.

"This game is amazing, worth the money. If you want a quick start to the game, get the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack with the Whale Shark Card. Worth the 60$. Amazing quality for a older game."
The game is a decade old and still a lot of fun.
Best graphics ever in any game ive seen
it is one of the best game iv ever played
great visuals
This is a great game for me to let out my pent up aggression from a stressful day.

Great game of the century
"Great concept terrible execution and exploitation of consumer. I've had the game for I don't know, a year or so. I've only been able to play it 50% of the time due to bugs and really long load times. Support really evasive. One-sided value system that benefits the company at the expense of consumer. For example, whatever the in-game currency is, people pay real money for that so in situations where a bug or crashed server cost you in-game money, one just loses that unless they're willing to submit to the evasive support program each time. However they are suspending, banning and etc,,, to yes customers for exploiting the third party mod-menus that may reward in-game money.  Let's just look at the subject of modders. I think it's safe to say all modders aren't alike. On one hand you have the griever who goes around heckling any and everybody. On the other hand you have the modder who became a modder to defend against the griever. lastly , the modder who only wants to experience his purchase in a re-imagined way that's not dictated by the game's producer. At any rate the producer should be concerned with what the consumer demand is not with a strict dictatorship of what they wanted the experience to be like. Let's keep it real. Software companies think total emersion is key, when in fact it isn't. All that is needed is just enough realism to fool the surface senses and then the fantasy. For example: Most people lives suck. They don't play video games to remind them how much their lives suck they play to escape. Each time Rockstar releases a version of GTA the public responds with they think the product should be instead of what is presented (mod-menus). Instead of Rockstar taking it as constructive criticism they look at it almost as if you stole or destroyed something. Remember modders are consumers too, and might arguably constitute the majority of Rockstar's clientele base. At the end of the day, it's not what you do but how you do it. Recently, my GTA V account was suspended and online character reset with no explanation. To treat a customer in such a way was shocking, so me knowing such companies live and die off the constant reinvestment of consumers I'm just bidding my time waiting for the release of CTA 6 and I'll pass. I'll pass on anything Rockstar. One for their hubris. Two for the disrespect of the money I invested into the company in comparison to what was gain in actual game play and time. And I'm sure I'm not the only one. I know this was written very poorly but it's early, I'm annoyed and really didn't want to have to write this in the first place, so please forgive my poor grammar."

This game is as broken as their hour-long load screens.  Pay to play since the new consoles came out. Plus they removed all the activities and cars that were worth playing.

"Modders and grieffers have destroyed this game and made it unplayable.  You spend days grinding to buy something, you upgrade it the way you want it, spending nearly $2million. You take your new vehicle out to drive, and some modder changes everything about your vehicle, then blows you up for 2 hours straight for complaining, then call you ungrateful.  This game use to be awesome, but modders and grieffers ruined it. Oh and Rockstar, you better get on to fixing this or no one will be interested in GTA 6 if this shit will be allowed to continue. As it is, I want my money back for GTA V"

its fine for the story mode but other than that its shit because there is absolutly no attention to detail and theres nothin to do like if you want to play online theres always a hacker or sweat thats spawn killing you and the only thing to do in online is make gta money THATS IT  plus on story mode still same thing nothing else to do other than the story and this game never and i mean NEVER gets actual updates they only ever change the whether in online mode and some items get a different skin never fixing and glitches or banning hackers no just pay to win usless crap. dont get it its fun at first but then it gets boring as shit and the AI is dumber then a deep fried hamburger dipped in sweet and sour sauce

"Played for 99 hours, about to get my first achievement 10/10"
its a really cool and fun game!
This game made me lose my mind more than 20 times
ma boy its the best one yet..... i recomend you look in vannila unicory you feal me
I was just playing gta online but then i got banned for killing a cheater thinking that I cheat it exist so many cheaters but i get banned  i farmed years only for money and its getting reset and i got suspended i worked years and you guys are just suspending me ike i cheated otherwise the real cheaters still cheart.
This game is Really Good i Recomemded that other people play GTA 5 online and GTA 5 Storyline mode
same gaame many years later
the best in the west
"It is a truly a good game, there are som hacks in some lobbeys but it aint bad. You should try it"
i like it but why no entering the airport :(
GTA V is one of my favorite games. Glad I can carry it everywhere with me
Really fun
This game makes my skin crawl!
one of a kind
"Only leaving a negative review because all the online updates have bloated the install to over 109 GB at the time of this writing. That's absolutely insane. I just wanted to reinstall to revisit an OLD game for a little single player goofing around. Didn't this used to be like a 17 GB install back in the day? I don't care at all about GTAO. Can't that be separated into a different install?   Rockstar, you've been milking this old game for over a decade now. Give it a rest, and give us a classic GTAV install to use if we just want to play single player. Make GTAO it's own thing. And where is GTA6 already."
Hands down still one of my favorite games Easily
nicer game
yes if you have a good computed with i7 and a RTX 3060
I like how owerpowerd you can get if you play like as long as possible
Good game with good graphics.
everting is fun add me
"it's alright so far, haven't played enough to decide for sure"
"I thought it was cool, but today I was suspended from Online for no reason AND my character is erased. I can't do anything about it, so in my opinion it's not worth it because you can lose all your progress and can't even write to them."
"Its a great game don't get me wrong but, it gets somewhat repetetive if you singleplayer, you should play gta with more friends or something the story for single is good and if you finished it there is only left then gta online, and its filled with hackers or bugs i just think you should play gta 5 only with friends honestly."
this game is one of the best games i played
sabko pta hai iske bare main no need to tell anything
"gta v has been one of my og games that made me addicted to gaming. dont just play gta v online ok??? u have to play the storymode as it is one of the best story-driven games i have ever played and would def play the game again. gta v online is pretty cool too but nothing beats storymode if u have no clue what it is about. cos gta v online has some cool gta v easter eggs and even gta iv easter eggs and its pretty cool once u get the reference. srsly play storymode  in terms of actually loading in the game, there were times id get dc-ed a bunch of times in online but what can u say???? what do u expect from a pc game lol better try playing this on ur console if u have one cos its much better for sure and so u can play it nonstop :)"
this is the best game! thx steam for let me donwload this Legendary Game
purchased the game got a prostitute got a private dance in a strip club killed a man robbed a store then the games loading screen was finished and did it all over again.10 /10 would do again
"Don't get me wrong, the game itself can be fun. I have a good number of hours into it over the years. The single player was also quite good. Truthfully there are quite a few reasons to recommend or buy this game if you never have, but given the company behind it and the way they treat their patrons and players, handle their business, communicate things, etc I just can't recommend anyone support this. I firmly believe that we vote with our wallets, and the only way to really impact the bottom line of these greedy corporations is to not buy the shit they are selling if we don't like it. That's how we make them wake up, and that's how we get the changes we want. At the time of release, we didn't know what we know now. The game is what, nearly a decade old at this point? No new game, no real new content, just rehashed things for online. Egregious actions such as removing items from the game that people paid for, and removing the anti-cheat system to prevent it from being a cesspool in public online lobbies. These are just core things that you should not do, and yet, they do them. The price of things use to be somewhat reasonable, it was a nice balance of grind vs reward upon launch. Now, everything is so overpriced its not worth it to grind for, and this was done solely with the malicious intentions to force players to buy shark cards for real money to acquire in game items. The only thing we are missing at this point is a battle pass, then we really will be at the peak of modern games. Anyway, if you already own this game, by all means enjoy it. I implore you not to buy their shark cards, and if you don't already own this game, just pass on this. Save your money or take it elsewhere, preferably to a company/developer that doesn't choose to do the most despicable things at every turn."
I like this game so much that ii buyed new computer just for gta.
just buy the damn game and stop looking at the comments
best online game ever
"There is only one thing, that i would love if Rockstar made hunting possible and selling meat of animals for dollars and i know T can do hunting but I would like to play free play like taxi driver, that would be awesome to do in game Although, i would not do that in real life though, just to be clear, i am a gta fan also waiting for gta 6."

"Online play is absolute garbage. Playing this online puts you at risk for getting dossed CONSTANTLY, among other MAJOR security risks. Modders make the game unplayable. Harassment is a huge issue, and the general population of the game seems to consist entirely of psychopathic teenagers and low-life human beings. The only purpose that this game serves in a useful capacity would be for the FBI to build profiles on the mentally unstable people that play this, and imprison them before they hurt someone or themselves."
un juego con mas de 10 años que es mejor que los nuevos
got my cock wet then killed a bitch.
"Great story mode, lots to do, constant updates. Can't wait to get GTA6"
I've just killed 2 police officers and i am wanted in several states for tax evasion. I think this might be it.
I PLAY WITH MYSELF TO THIS GAME
Great game the best part is the strip club

"Very good game with lots of cool mechanics and features, pretty good graphics compared to previous gta games. The story is really good and fun with good characters but rockstar needs to make this game cross platform in online mode and same with gta 6 when it comes out. However do not buy shark cards they are not worth it. i love starting illegal businesses (in gta of course)"
ok yes this is bussin
you can blow people up
5th time buying this goddamn game
killing ppl
This game is Pretty decent but when it comes to the shooting system or glitches it is either full of them or just trash system. If you dont have a problem with getting stuck in walls mid heists and die or just pure glitches of not being able to shoot while in a mission (heist or mid fight) or seeing the UI then sure go for it and try it.
end
"Slow loading times, lots of modders, glitches and bugs, slow grind for money, it can be quite fun/entertaining at times or with friends but its just not a good overall experience,"
its great (BUT)it have a lot of dark joke and bad things that i do not wanna talk about so it make the game unfunny and bornig
get roasted in a mission for a terrible cut
"too many hackers, almost nothing in place to catch or reprimand them. Rockstar does not care about their players, just the money. doubt VI will be any better."
Bsuhwaaa
willy wonka is a child guy nice couck

ok. but need GTA VI
"This game is my one of the favourite game. After 3 years finally I am able to play this is game, and I recommend everyone to try once. After you try, you will become fan of this game.

Yes definitly its really funny and cool and you can get mods :)
"What can you say about this game now? It's GTA5, it is what it is. I've been playing on my ROG Ally and it works great."
its amazing game playong it for 9+ years never got bored but u havr to play it with mod
Fun 👍
BEST GAME EVER MADE HANDS DOWN I JUST WISH WE CAN BUY REAL POLICE CARS AND BE ABLE TO SAVE THEM.
VERY GOOD GAMEEEE
Waiting for GTA VI
"This action adventure real life rpg is like nothing else on the market, I have already made deep investments in this game."
Its hell being a low level but it sure is fun
it's so good and so fun to play
"Played the singleplayer 6 times on ps 8 years ago, yes, its amazing."
No words. One of the Best game of all time
i lost my mental health on this game.(0-0)
impresive story
Not for me - The one and only GTA IS SAN ANDREAS
Excellent.
gta 5 supre  stream superb
gen win
"do i really need to say much? Of course it's great, this game is a classic in history."
Amazing game highly recommend to other users
GAME IS SHIT
"yeah its good very good actually, but i would like to suggest to have a room or server that for normal player and aggresive player hahahaha, its to hard to play around with aggresive player :3."
"Rockstar Game Launcher kinda sucks, so here's how you can play gta 5 without it!  https://github.com/onajlikezz/Nightlight-Game-Launcher/releases/tag/NLLauncherV1"
"Too many hackers, its out of control!!!"
"GTA V is an absolute masterpiece. But Rockstar should’ve stuck to updating RDR2, GTA V brings nostalgia but it feels like you have o’ yeller on the stretcher hooked to IVs and wires to stay alive. The mods for this game are amazing, but there’s so much trouble trying to keep them. As long as they’re for story mod it should be fine. I just wanna mod singleplayer. Would buy again just to mod gta v singleplayer."
epic game. me like
makes me want to kms (keep myself safe)
gta VI??
"whole lots of hackers, someone got my ip address pulled, then I got booted."
they should make a game about stealing motarcicles and car
game if fun and i love it
save game hilang pepekkkkkkkkkkk
ton o fun
its a gta
fuck you old ass game
nuh uh
"Micheal: I'm going to break those fucking fingers if you don't knock that shit off!  Trevor: Well, please, alright. You'd alleviate the boredom."

I have not been able to access steam games for years. I'll never buy another steam game again! Waste of money!
Best game of the generation.

I LIKE THIS GAME CASE YOU SO MUCH FREEDOMB
gay sex
its cool i guess
You cant have sex with daddy lester
I love gta 5
po pici fasa hra oooooo
Bought the game and the key doesn't work.  RockStar support never responded to my ticket.  Steam support never responded to my ticket.  Scammed.
i will play this game for ever!!!!!
good. aprooved
extreme fun
dick suckk pussy get me banned steam u bunch of niggers
One of the best grand theft auto series
amazing game 10/10 would recommend
good game but gta 6 aint out so idk
reeeel
"After 10 years this game is still a great play, and switching from console to PC has been fun. I have to say this game is a bit dated though and we definitely need more content from rock star to be released soon."
ههخاه
123456789
really nice
Amazing game play it
i lost my gta account and i cant get it back  Gta 5:Bad
very fantaastic
"W game, not voilent though, should be 3+ in  my opinion."
Good stuff
dadsdsa
it sool fun i like it
I have played a fair bit! good fun with friends!
some of the conversations feels illegal to hear 😭💀
"Amazing game, stable above 150 fps on Ultra settings with RTX 4070Ti"
"top tier game, when gta VI"
this game is really good because of the cool cars and planes and detail
"Storymode- Best 50hr B-movie with unforgettable characters and blood pumping heists .....and more attention to detail than my parents ever gave me .  Online- just enough content to keep you roaming Los Santos for 300 more hours ,with even better heists to do with friends (the grind is real) truly one of the games of all time ...KIFLOM"
Social Club has the worst launcher and support ever.
BEST GAME FOR EVER
"I don't recommend. I recently tried to go onto GTA to find out I've been permanently banned for literally no reason. Never purchasing another Rockstar Product again.  Literally have done nothing, I only play storymode but I tried to go online for the first time and I just see ""permanently banned""."
"It's been 8 years since I've been playing this game online and Rockstar hasn't been able to fix the goddamm online, fucking 7 years old have access to mod menus that make them invincible, rockstar doesn't punish players that play with cheats, as long as you don't touch their sharkcards, shame on you rockstar, I'm afraid to think what will happen to the online of GTA VI, but I'm sure that I won't be there because you don't deserve my time with this bullshit."
i cant play because i tried to danlowedn
good game but got grounded when helping that one guy with the virus on the pc
exellet game .must play
idk its lilke really old but its goood ig
NHUBUYB
lovely played the story 3 times over by now.
"Boring gameplay, weird inputs, long loading times. Not worth your time or your money."
this game very good
is my favorit game
gg!
"Sold my expensive csgo agent to experience GTA ONLINE and I would say it was worth it. Idc how aggressively this game is milked I just love it. Its like a never ending journey. DONE FROM GRINDING? well you can join hundreds of car meet crews and enjoy, BORED FROM CAR MEETS? , try dominating in pvp, DESTROYED ALL THE TRYHARDS?, well you can have fun in all the small and big missions with your friends which pay less but are intresting, YOU DONT HAVE FRIENDS? well thats a skill issue........"
BULLSHIT i just want to sit and play but the rockstar launcher keep having trouble and ask me to relogin reconfuse and stuff
"i like taking a truck and running people over for ""fun"" :>"
my mc just snorted a gonk load of diverse drugs and hightailed it to rob blonde johnny depp on his island
play then u will undertand how good it is
"What can I say, obviously one of the best"
"In my Opinion, the 2nd best GTA game out there and my 3rd personal favorite gta game. Map is very beautiful compared to GTA IV and has a lot more explorations and Easter Eggs. Gunplay is very good however melee can get very boring and repetitive overtime compared to GTA IV and San Andreas that has multiple hand to hand/melee combat. I like how they handle the 3 protagonist swapping and their uses on the Story Missions. Only Issue i can say about the game is it's boring online gameplay and lastly wish it has new game plus where we can replay the story with all our money/stats."
real fun. You should try it :)
dxhdtktkdjrj
More than words can express. You just gotta play it to experience it first-hand. Amazing title.
"The first 1000 hours or so are pretty good, but after that, the games gets a little repetitive."
good game?
Nur liebe für dieses Spiel.
Im horny with thus game

"Can't play without internet, fuck rockstar, eat shit and die"
Disgusting pay pig game may all your wealth be cursed sons of harlots
VERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERY GOOO GAME
Best game ever..PERIOD. GTA VI is coming!
vary fun but hackers are not
"For players looking to play online, with friends:   You'll spend more than half your time loading in, crashing, re-loading in, experiencing errors, and timeouts but the glorious 15 minutes of actual game play with your friends will almost make it worth it...aside from the infinite mission restarts. It's a real love-hate/abusive relationship, be warned.   And why is it always raining? Single-player works fine though."
my lack of reading comprehension doesnt stop me from committing crimes in this game  10/10
shooting up a strip club is fun
Its Alright
Might be the perfect game made yet
VERY GOOD'
this game is very fun and with friends its way more friends
fuck ton of modders that mess with you for no reason. that really made me wanna stop playing. but if you can look past that its alright i guess
excellent addition to the legacy and its like 7-9 years old you should already have it
nothing that i dont like
pretty fun man
its gta V what can i say
This game is pretty fun

W game would be good if all the building were accessible for players in story mod and online

this game is so fun!!!

the best game out in other platforms
A buggy infested game for the online game play. Story mode still holds up in 2023 and worth at least playing once. 7 out of 10 rubber chickens for my rating.

"great game but requires way too much disk space, has a cheater problem, and you need a rockstar games account to play (you also need to install the ""social club"" and the rockstar games launcher to your computer)"
fun to drive into people

Been playing GTA Online for many years with friends and family both on console and PC. There is a lot to do now compared to years ago and is definitely worth picking up while waiting for VI to come out.
this very nice
"i can go to strip club, therefor good"

very good game if your are +18
"Game is really good but maybe you do ukrainian localization I don't talk about voice localization but I wanna see ukrainian text localization. You didn't it in gta 5 so I want see ukrainian text localization in gta 6.""Please"""

My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on GTA V and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.
do u really want review?
very nice games with nice story
"This game is old, but it is still fun, but there are some saboteurs and hackers in the online mode. I give it a 9/10."
love it with all my hirt
"L game. Can't get a girlfriend (like in GTA IV) so it's too realistic, I thought this was meant to be fiction."

game như  con cặc toàn hack
"I absolutely love this game... Unfortunately, due to the fact that its developers FORCE you to use their garbage piece of crap launcher, I cannot recommend this game to anyone unless I tell them to just crack it. Buy it on steam for all I care and then crack it... but for your own sanity PLEASE DO NOT USE ROCKSTAR GAMES SOCIAL CLUB!!!! My account on the social club has been hacked 3 times and I'm not the only one. Many people have had this same issue and it seems that Rockstar could not be bothered about it. They take 3 weeks minimum to fix the issue (I have heard of people waiting months without a solution) and then you just have to hope that nobody targets your account to hack into it. Rockstar just sends you an email that says ""Your account email address has been updated. Emails will now be sent to h38es@fivesense.site instead. (That would be the account that the hacker used I would assume).  Rockstar you suck. 0/10"
Very Fun Of course
very good game w niggas
modrs
just keeps crashing
i will die before the next gta game comes out and so will you
one of the best games i have played
good game! Waiting for gta 6
yes this the game i want so buy them
All I do is log on and drive maybe rob a gas station 10/10
My favorite game <3
RockStar allow cross play progression.
Enjoyable game
"Grand Theft Auto 5, one of my favourite games ever. The best Grand Theft Auto game in my opinion. Overall great game, massive open world,  fun and great multiplayer and an amazing experience. Next-gen versions with first person mode switching and first person mode is so good, if you prefer that way of playing and so many options and settings to change to give you the ultimate GTA V experience in first or third person. This is just an absolute masterpiece the heists in online mode and story mode are so good. Very highly recommend buying this game the best GTA in the series it will never get old. It's just so good the story mode and everything I have nothing else to say it's just the best👍❤"
its okay i guess
niceyf
i like the watur
more hackers than actual players on PC...
i like the chaos
Modding GTA 5 is funny as all get up! Still is one of the games of all time and has done a way of gaming where only a few games have replicated since.
open  world
very fun with friends wish i has some
"mao to no, ganahan lng ko 😂"

Make sure this is one of 'em."

"what is love, baby dont hurt me, dont hurt me no more"
"if you like playing against others, then online is worth  myself? I don't like online and I do 100% games.... except this game is an absolute joke. Online, everything is extremely expensive so you will waste a lot of real life, just to afford things, after all, this is how they want to manipulate and make you ""out of your free will"" use the codes called bank details and purchases the shark rip off add ons, oh sorry, since it's legal rip off, it's called: Marketing  so anyway, because of the legal rip-off, called marketing, you will waste a lot of real-life hours playing this. After all, they did not introduce a lot of stuff in story mode, and you can only ever play with many such vehicles in story mode if you use 3rd party programs... of course, this means a risk of ban on your account.  so again, if you want 100%, avoid this game. And if you want to play with some of the vehicles, that are online exclusive, well, you sadly will not be able, to unless of course, you use 3rd party which is not allowed, after all, they are allowed to legally rip you off, make you spend hours and hours and hours, ""play"" this game, to encourage you to use real money to access stuff, but you using a 3rd party program is not allowed. oh and did I already mention? whoever makes the requirements for the achievements are trolls. That person/s most likely never did the achievements themself or have a gruge against people who love doing 100%. Just look at the requirements. including maps that show you collectables on a map, just for an idea."

One of my favorite games of all time. Enjoy yourself!
"Tryhards are annoying, but if you get good you can make them cry, they find enjoyment out of griefing low levels, then you grief them, the throw a hissy fit"
wont let me sign in because it says my steam acc is linked to a different rock star acc but it wont let me see what account that is so it just locked me out indefently. 50 dollers and 250 hours down the drain.
this game is increadiblee

The most fun part is blowing up cars on the highway.
Best Game But i think that steam must give some $$$ money to all players because some of them cant buy SHARKS
Thought that Gta VI is coming so why not play Gta V ?
"One of the best game on PC, This game has amazing graphics and the best part is you can run this game in a low spec pc  The story line is awesome, good character design"

"This game has the most infuriating MP of all the games I've played throughout my life. Full of cheaters, which makes public lobbies unplayable. If you lose connection you automatically get connected to SP where you must try to reconnect yourself because the game drops you and you should continue playing SP? Does that even make sense? Exactly. Initial heist missions require you to have 1-3 people in your team, which even at lv 100+ ruin you games and you're forced to make THE SIMPLEST TASKS with 3 brainless players that shoot civilians instead of playing."
fun and boobies
great gme
Very good Graphics and i like missions
its gta. big dubs
W game on everything i love
makes me want to die in real life
"missions are way too hard, movement mechanics suck ASS, police get on me for now reason and its impossible to lose stars quickly, wayy too complicated to join and STAY in friends sessions, vehicles too expensive, no fast travel, pay to win a bunch of this are terrible about this game dont play just wait for gta 6"

GTA V is best game on steam
very nice game and has good driving mechanics
It’s GTA I don’t know what to say it’s the best f***ing game ever.

"its cool edit: very very very cool. one of the best games ive played, its a must buy."
yes i love it
i liked the titties in the strip club they made me hard
great game easy to play
"Story mode is great, online is an okay experience as long as you have some friends to play it with. Stick to invite only sessions, every public session has modders who will most certainly ruin your online experience."
yesss join
عالی
If you are looking for a fun game.  Pick this one!
"xbox version is much better, pc version is absolute garbage."
Mommy caught me at the club :(
"you can never run out of stuff to do, would recommend online mode with friends"
ROCKSTAR GAMES SOCIAL CLUB     Not more to say.
tthis game is best
"I do recommend GTA 5, tho a few have been using mods online aka ""God Mode"" so getting into a poop server does occasionally happen 45 percent of the time. IF ya cant level up to get the game done proper and have to use cheats to horn boost accel fine- Don't make the game dumb for everyone else and port into peoples cars with settings to disallow passengers!"
shoot kill and maybe get head by lester once or twice higly reccommend

Great variety of gaming modes and all are top notch. 10/10
CAYO PERICO MI VICIO
its hella fun
"paid for this game, played it a lot. suddenly one day i cant play anymore because ""rockstar games launcher failed to initialize"" tried every video on yt to try and fix but nothing works (and the only videos i didnt follow were ones that needed you to install mods to fix it) so ig i just have to wait for a random day where they patch their broken launcher !! so fun !! rockstar is just a small indie company guys!! :')"

"I dont know why I keep coming back to GTA every once in a while, I think its the updates thinking maybe the game is better.  Every time I play for multiple hours I just feel dead after playing.  I think it all starts from wanting to go to the strip club, have sex in a car, and it turns into doing random things and shooting.    Some of the multiplayer stunt missions have been absolutely hilarious fun, but GTA does have a terrible way of setting up or gathering players for a game, that ends up having everyone leaving.  Remember when the game first came out and there is absolute huge hype.  I've already heard rumors of GTA 6 coming and literally youtube videos saying the rapture is going to happen when the game is out, that its going to be super photo realistic and everyone is going to be playing the game.  Jesus coming back to take us, really all we want is peace and love.  I need a relationship with Jesus and to go be with him in heaven one day, I need to pray and read the bible.  I just feel dead after playing and time wasted.  At least after 8 hours constantly playing all day, you can get closer to the end point of quitting than if you played casually for years."
boring af
it's a game!
It will enjoy it for quite a long time.

loading screen gave me boner
if your account gets hacked good luck playing the game ever again :D
Bom dmais
"Paid for the game. Own the game. Can't play the game anymore because of the Rockstar launcher being needlessly baked in to the download, and the mandatory social club account requirement locking me out because I previously made an account that I can not log into. An account I know the username for, an account I know the password for, an account I know full well I registered under my main email address, I can even find the old verification emails proving this, yet the cockstar launcher claims that the social club account linked to my Steam account uses an email address I have no memory of ever using, and it doesn't help that most of this email address is censored in the ""we couldn't log you in automatically"" prompt. Not going to bother chasing up cockstar support for this, gonna attempt to get a refund, and regardless of how that goes, I will not pay for another cockstar game again."
on top
I'm new at this game. And I played it for like 5 hours only. But I had so much fun driving like a psycho (it ended up in hell) with my friend.
this game is terrible and nothing ever works and glitches are everywhere but i cant stop playing it whenever i get on my computer i catch myself running to this awful ass game

"The game itself? Great, it's GTA, what did you expect. However... I can't even play it anymore.  I bought this game waaay back, but never had the time to complete it. Now that I finally could, I installed it and tried to log back into my old Rockstar account... only to discover that it got broken into and even email changed without any notification on my old email address... Now I can't log in, can't play and can't even register a new account as this email address which I've never seen is now locked onto my steam account. Great job Rockstar... make your own, useless launcher and than don't protect it properly from hackers. It's a joke... you're a joke.  I opened a customer support ticket, but I'll be sure not to buy anything from Rockstar ever again. Great job protecting our accounts and data!"
after I downloaded it the game is stuck o a black screen after clicking on the Game app icon and I don't know what to do ... so
BERYY BERYY NICE
"They banned me for being black, they fr racist af. i didn't do shit but then these mf's decided to post my dox and say the n word and stuff like that bro. it messed me tf up. these mf really be letting me dictate what happens in my life. dem niggas needa die fr"
i brutally kill my friends when they don't blow up the strip club with me
that raning theme is very irretating me.
"GTA Online is very fun if you have friends. The grinding in this game is on one hand very satisfying because you see some progress made if you choose the right businesses. But on the other hand it can be very boring and frustrating if you get the same missions on a row or do the same business multiple times.  The missions and rewards overall became better from update to update. New content is being released regularly. While some of these updates are quite horrible (why tf do you remove most of the cars from the sites where you can buy them?), most of them give you a few hours of fun. Replayability is not guaranteed though.  Thumbs up, because its fun."
One of the Best Game I ever Played in Life
"i have a sh*tty gaming laptop, i purchased it with the knowledge i need too much disk space i runned the game putted on the lowest grpahics setting possible and... it fricking works! every setting on low resolution on 1080x720 im running this game minumaly 50 fps to maximum 80 fps and im soooo happy that i can play gta nomrally !!! love this game!!!!"
what a great game
Still a good game even after 10 years. Just need to fix the servers.
tooo many hackers in game
"This game, really cannot be well described in a review, but i'll try my best.   The Single-Player and Story are very good, lots of activities, quite a sizeable amount of overall variety interms of vehicles, weapons, businesses. However, for those coming from GTA IV, this is a more ""light"" sided story, rather than the grim from the GTA IV, so don't expect another emotional ride about how war is horrible and it screws people over.  This is more of a cynical reality of what USA is, and wants to be, dumb fun simply said.   Now, the Online section(which is controversial for many).  The Online pretty much is a whole seperate game, and i'd treat it as a MMORPG Sandbox than a open world, this is one of it's biggest flaws and upsides. For those that like to grind their games, this is one of the best mixed genres if you ask me, there is content suited for most likely anyone.   Concluding this whole jumbo-mumbo, buy it, you will definitely get your value from this game(especially on sale, 14 euros?!)"
Massive

"I'm approaching eighteen thousand hours played, and there are still parts of this game I've never seen.  The content added over the years in online is staggering."
Goated game 10 out of 10 would recommend
"Grand Theft Auto V is a highly engaging and immersive open-world game that offers an intense and exhilarating experience. It boasts a vast and diverse world filled with activities and missions that keep players immersed for hours on end. The game's storyline is engaging and the characters are well-realized, allowing players to get emotionally invested in the game's plot. The graphics and sound are top-notch, and the game’s mechanics are intuitive and fun to learn. Despite some minor glitches and occasional frustrations, Grand Theft Auto V remains a classic and highly recommended game."
"este juego es el mejor, te explicare porque, es viejo lo jugaban todos, y si lo jugaste en xbox 360 o ps3, ya sea en la de tu amigo primo o tuya, o simplemente fuiste a unas maquinitas, compralo este es un juego de los que si o si deberias tener tiene historia muy entretenida y para mi es el mejor juego que tengo ahorita :D  compralo"

very good game but the modders are annoying and fiveM is ass i get banned for every rp i go to
good game.. love
stuck in endless tutorial loop. no fun at all. Delete character and start again to skip tutorial at least puts an end to the introductory misery but would have preferred to not waste several hours going in circles to start with.

"its stupid as hell when you equip a knife or baseball bat and when you're about to swing, your idiotic character decides to kick ??? remove that stupid mechanic !!! allow us to stab some npc to death. AND ALSO when you swing your bat, golf club, wrench or whatever, make it a higher swing ! so its not at a low elevation hit. i enjoy destroying cars and i hate when it swings at the same leveled area and not windows and stuff. another stupid thing .. when youre driving and whip out your gun .. why the hell are you destroying the window for ?"
Must have

"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! Hackers have the ability to crash your game and remove you from any lobby, even if your playing solo. Rockstar will not ban them and Steam will not give you a refund. I have tried to complain to both and received a giant go F**k yourself in return. Plus the entire community protects them and calls them ""modders"" not hackers! DO NOT BUY A GAME THAT OTHER PLAYERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TURN OFF YOUR GAME FROM THEIR COMPUTER! AVOID AT ALL COST!"

"Really good game. Especially with friends. There are alot of thing you can do such as: Mission, Tuning Cars, Heists and just having fun. I recommend this game for those people who like shooting and driving. There may be some cheaters but you can report them. I have played the game for almost 200 hours and it never gets boring to me."
Hello How a u im under the water PHM!
cyka
i like the game and the graphic
Overall a good game but i am really pissed of right know and i can fuck anyone from rockstar. They are a million dollar game maker and they don't even care about players. The game take to long to open and in the game it has to connect with the rockstar server for online playing.. And the launcher fail most of the time. In the game when i am in a friend's session it automatically kick all players and i had to complete my fucking mission again. And i am not even talking about those fucking mission icons in online map.. They sucks everytime.. And the game is full with hackers and when my teammate drive in missions it seems the car is teleporting because of lag issues..   My pc spec is decent so dont tell me it is my pc problem  Core i5-9600k AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (8GB) 16 GB Ram 3200
I lost my rockstar social account and now it won't let me play the game what so ever.

"yeah uh game is solid, rockstar kinda prioritized fun over realism this time comparing to gta4  story mode is good, fun, replayed it like 6 times. normal rockstar stuff  online? it's... complicated... it is kinda fun, but it also shows rockstar's greed.  the game is good, but the company right now is so sh*t it almost can't be believed"
Beat up random npc: police doesnt care Police car rams me: 3 Stars wanted Great game

Old but still fun
i am playing rp servers but on my ps4 i played gta and i got to say that if you did not play this game you can not have a complete live
"Mostly Positive. I didn't like the main story because I don't relate with psychopaths so I didn't finish it. But, there is enough to do in the online game for PVE with some friends in a closed session. I generally avoided PVP since there are too many hackers that have ruined open sessions. You can solo play most of the online game in a closed session and I tried that for a while but ultimately got bored quickly. If you buy a military vehicle, you generally can't use it in the heists (except the setup missions), but you can use them for cargo, nightclub and moto-club. The humor in newer updates (such as drug wars) has become more crass/annoying and less tongue-in-cheek. They still haven't fixed the slow player controls after all these years. The only reason I have so many hours in the game is because there was a time when I could go AFK while the nightclub accumulated, but they changed that. I recommend buying this on sale if you're looking for something different to play, but don't expect too much. Once you get to the endgame, there's nothing to do other than collect expensive useless vehicles. Don't hesitate to move on to a different game at that point."
very entertaining...!!!
very good exitment
love the fiveM roleplay
the game is not working
"as amazing as always, bought it to play it on my steam deck"

i mean gta
Dont really like this game its kind of violent
"Ah, Grand Theft Auto V, the game that proves crime can be a family affair! From the moment I first stepped into Los Santos, I knew I was in for one wild ride. You see, this game has it all - action, mayhem, and a touch of good ol' family drama.  The city itself is stunning, and it's like a virtual playground for chaos. I mean, I've stolen planes, jumped out of helicopters, and even robbed a few stores with my pals Franklin and Trevor. It's like a never-ending vacation, except with more gunfights and fewer piña coladas.  Franklin is the man when it comes to driving. He's got a need for speed that's just as crazy as mine, but with fewer traffic accidents. Trevor, on the other hand, is well... let's just say he's a unique character. He's the kind of guy you don't want to cross, but he's also the kind of guy you can't help but laugh at. His explosive personality matches the explosive action in the game.  And don't get me started on the missions! From heists to drug deals gone wrong, it's like a never-ending rollercoaster of adrenaline. There's something truly satisfying about pulling off a perfectly executed heist, and then escaping from the cops like a bunch of pros.  But it's not all about crime. You can play tennis, go for a round of golf, or just chill out by the beach. Los Santos is the perfect place for a getaway, as long as you don't mind the occasional gang shootout or police chase.  In a nutshell, GTA V is like a Hollywood blockbuster that you get to star in. So grab your virtual sunglasses, hop in a stolen car, and get ready for a wild ride. Just remember, crime doesn't pay...unless you're playing this game!"
Worth it
I mean who doesn't know GTAV
Cool game.

when is gta VI coming out this is getting old
非常好玩的游戏
Story mode - 10/10 GTA online - trash
"For £14 i would buy it. I would not buy it if its goes up any more lets be honest the game it not what it used to be. It is full of hackers and sweats. Gta online is awful, with people spawn killing you as you load in and worse. If i were you i would just wait for gta 6 because this is a waist of your money. Rockstar just want your money with DLC after DLC. I would rate this game a score of.  5.5/10"
They need to add skibidi toilet to the game it would make it 10x better plssssss
"ITA AO FUN! but the only things that bothers me is online when other players kill you every 6 seconds.....but overall amazing game, definitely recommend it to people who like to create characters and murder people :)"

"After 10 years, I would expect security on online servers to be decent at least. I almost got dox'd today because people on GTA Online are malice. This is by far the worst game I have ever played. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU VALUE ANY TYPE OF CYBER SECURITY!"
This game died early 2019 no one besides bots actually play this no one cares about spooky events on a 10+ year game stop jerkinf eachother off and get gta 6 out already!!!@Rockstar games   finished all achievements still hate the game btw.
"Its a thumbs up...  NB. I don't touch online, never will.  Characters are great, the story is nice enough, the heists make the missions a bit more meaningful and connected, the radio is interesting/funny and has some good atmospheric tracks, the open world is really nicely done.  I bought this game twice on Xbox but never finished it because first one disc got trashed, then when I got a second my xbox was trashed. So I picked this up in a sale on pc to finally finish it.  The bad points: - The open world is great, but,.... often meaningless. This was a criticism of mine for San Andreas (albeit one of the greatest games of all time). You can go somewhere and it looks nice, but is there any purpose, or meaning? If you want to shoot beachgoers yes but not a lot else. It reminded me of Fallout IV, where you can build a base with a pool table, but why, when no one interact with you? - They really need to put manual gearchanges in to their next GTA. I know lots of US vehicles are auto but the driving is boring, in that there is no satisfaction of dropping a gear to get up a hill or overtake. - the speed is restricted/unrealistic: watching the speedometer I think it goes up to 100mph for pretty much all cars,.. really, a Ferrari or whatever doing 100mph max? You should be able to push it to 155,... and be punished for doing so by wrapping yourself around a tree. It makes driving (half the game really) quite timid) - Most missions are still just drive,... bang,...shoot,...drive..... crash,... drive,... finish. Look I know it is 'GTA', but still, the missions are quite repetitive and feel quite dumb in the great environment that there is - Controls when walking are awkward. I think this is much better in RDR2, hopefully it will be for any future GTA because the number of missions I messed up because the controls are clanky is huge. I never finished GTA IV because the controls were clanky (and I got sick of being called for dates to go bowling etc.) - all the money houses, businesses, side games don't seem to matter as you can finish tthe story quite early. After the first couple of missions I never went to an Ammunation again... I tried to use the stock market but didn't have enough to invest, then when I did, it was pretty much the end of the game. The golf and tennis is nice, but after a while you think what is the point, might as well get a golf or tennis game! And I totally forgot until now there was hunting. - They spent WAY too much time on doing the whole strip club thing, - Collectables were a bit meh, the whole underwater thing, way too time consuming compared to tagging in San Andreas which was fun.  So many criticisms yet still a thumbs up?  Because if you play through the story, just have a laugh, it is great fun and recommended and ultimately I am glad I played it. I think years ago the side elements of GTA were as good as even full games, but now GTA feels a bit of a jack of all trades, master of none; refining the driving and nicely fluid foot/combat controls in future might help.  Love the characters though just wish there had been twice the story."
ooohh forgot the email of your social club? well fuck you then you can't play the game. i just want to play the story mode :(
Oppressor MK-II is all u need ;p

"Single player is worth the money. GTA Online is literally only grinding for money to spend on vehicles and properties. I personally like the grinding, but if you don't, you should still buy because single player is exceedingly good."
".,,."
"great game. I absolutely hate it and it has taken away so many hours of my life, please help. I finally have enough money to buy some cars and now I cant cause they all got taken off the websites."
This game just has endless choice of what you can do and the replay ability is perfect as you can keep playing this game for so long and possibly end up never getting bored.
BUSS?

"Online is dead.  Speaking from a strictly online perspective there is no reason to play the game. Those with paid mod menus have eclipsed any level of cheat detection and are in every public lobby you join. It's boring to try and do missions when you just get killed by immortals, so you get a mod menu and then what? You're just being shot at for no reason while shooting back for no reason. This is advanced warfare. If GTA 6 has the same problem I don't want one joke about capitalism in it in GTA 6."
Obviously a great story mode Online is only really fun occasionally with friends these days FiveM servers are a good option if you want an new/alternative fun online experience
too many modders raockstar aint doin shit about. just got crashed for example.

No one should ever expect perfection but the glitches that still exist in gta online frustrate the hell out of me to the point of wanting to abandon this game. Fuck modders.

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is an outstanding open-world game. Its three-character storyline and detailed Los Santos world provide an immersive experience. Gameplay is diverse, and the online mode offers tons of additional content. However, the mature themes may not be suitable for all players. Overall, it's a must-play for fans of open-world action games. You can be whoever you want in this game."

I feel like Rockstar should give out GTA 6 for free if you purchased GTA 5 on three platforms.
Very funny with friends (def snag if on sale)
"Single player is ok, standard GTA story of steal cars and murder prostitutes etc.  Online has huge potential, if you enjoy modders/hackers (Who are most likely virgins living in their mothers basement.) killing you without any form of reason or sporting chance then you'll really enjoy this out of control game.  GTA online is clearly set in a free-for-all war-torn version of the US where nobody cares about anything other then money (A bit like Rockstar themselves). This is possibly where the inspiration came from as the game developers don't seem to care about anything as long as the game continues to make them money. Who cares if people mod, scam or cheat, it doesn't matter, its profitable.  If all that sounds like a good time, then this is the game for you!"

"On pc the gameplay consists of; being hacked, being griefed by hackers, being abused by hackers and your homeadress being leaked by hackers. So keep this in mind before buying this game on pc at full price."

"Awesome game, shitty community. Amazing story, amazing online. The online mode is a grind tho and kinda p2w, but everything else is extremely good. The open world is fun especially with friends, and the events are just amazing."
THE GAME
one the best masterpiece by rockstar
"This game is a timeless gem that sets the bar high for open-world gaming. Its complete and unique world, diverse characters, and engaging narrative make it an unparalleled experience. From the bustling streets of Los Santos to the stunning landscapes of Blaine County, the game's immersion is unmatched. The ability to switch between protagonists adds depth, humor, and satire to the storytelling. GTA Online's endless activities and heists provide countless hours of fun, but the only drawback is the persistent issue of hackers. Despite this, GTA 5 remains a must-play, a game that no other in its genre has yet to surpass."
really cool game
"gra, tata ta, gratatata"
good but it dosnt allow me to join online whilst the lspdfr mod is in the folder wich is very sad
IT is good
very bad game
goofy heist music :) :()
"thousands of hours of game play, replayable and enjoyable story, and fun experiences with friends"
It makes me feel like trevor
"The story mode is good, but the online mode is a superficial rigid waste of time in comparison, it's just about grinding and making money, not so much about having fun it seems. I would have enjoyed a decent story DLC much more and would have paid for it. The physics and some other details are less realistic than GTA IV, but the pc port works much better."

very ery good game
"Amazing story. I would recommend playing the story, I played through the story for like 7 times and I still found it great.  I've started playing this game since 2014 on ps3 and had my fun during all these years. The Online mode gets boring after a time once you have everything in the game, theres not much to do in Online except making money. Its def worth a try if you haven't already!"

I lost my email address which was linked to rockstar club and now I cannot play the game even when I have paid for it! It's also linked yo your steam account so you cannot make another Rock star club email and link to your steam.  Foolish Support by Rockstar club! They don't even care. You are basically screwed and they don't give a DUCK!

Only issue with this game is the prices on some things dont add up for example 600k for a railgun okay thats reasonable 400k for a gatling laser gun okay thats strange 400k for a laser rifle its nearly the same price as the gun that has one weakness the position you hold it that means you cant go in cover

"A heavily pregnant Rarity modeling some maternity outfits for Older!Spike in a private little fashion show. Rarity is pregnant with septuplets, and she’s showing off her ten-month-pregnant body for Spike, who is the father. Spike is looking on with great interest, leaning back and leisurely jerking off while he enjoys the show. Before he can cum, Rarity climbs down and mounts him cowgirl, letting him orgasm inside her. Spike has a ridged dick with a tapered point, along with a thick, bulbous knot at the end. Rarity is modeling a navy and violet dress with a silver hem.Rarity is pregnant again, this time with twelve foals. The compatibility and fertility of dragons and ponies is no longer in question, and the effects of which have been having an interesting effect on Rarity’s body. Dragon magic has started to intermingle with her own, bonding her to Spike and allowing him to be of equal size to mate with him no matter how big he grows. Which is good, because Spike has started growing more and more as days past, the power of the Elements starting to affect him as well. Now with both of them growing larger by the day with no sign of stopping, they have one last romp on their old bed before they both outgrow it.A few years have passed. Rarity and Spike have continued to grow bigger and stronger, continuing to have more children as the Elements of Harmony infuse them with divine power. Here, Rarity is once more ten months pregnant with more foals than ever, but even as a giant in a state of advanced hyper pregnancy, she still like to go hunting for gems. Spike still helps with her gem hunting endeavors, mostly to make sure she’s safe, but also as a bonding activity.   However, being alone in such a beautiful and nostalgic place often leads to them feeling frisky… although considering their sex drives these days, they’re pretty much always frisky.It was now clear destiny had something in mind for Spike and Rarity. The combination of the Elements and ancient dragon magic couldn’t be ‘blamed’ for their continually growing magic, size, and fecundity. Even their consciousnesses had begun to expand to new and greater heights, leaving many to speculate they were ascending into gods. Spike and Rarity didn’t know themselves, but the new abilities they discovered and demonstrated allowed them to not only provide for their growing family, but expand it even more.   Here, Rarity is implementing a new form of magic allowing her to be impregnated while already pregnant. In moments, her packed-full womb will be swelling even bigger with freshly-conceived lives; all rapidly gestating to catch up with their ‘older’ siblings. Spike’s orgasms are copious, but she won’t be wasting a drop of his thick, virile seed–it’s all going inside for maximum results.   Spike, who’d intended to watch the process, can hardly contain himself. He can sense the spell working, and is now about two seconds from plunging back inside Rarity and knocking her up even more. His massive nuts are filled to the brim and aching, his cock is harder than ever, and he fully intends to knot her and pump her full; first doubling the baby count… then quadrupling… then octupling…Spike and Rarity, now ascended into gods, are in the midst of creating new planets to raise their ever-growing family. Spike does the “heavy lifting” of the process, meaning the creation of the planet core and mantle, the planet’s crust and mountain ranges, the oceans, etc. Dragon magic is primal and more closely attuned to the building blocks of reality, so this task is easier for him. Once he’s done, Rarity comes in and does the “finer details” such as the atmosphere and weather, the flora and ecosystems, and more. Rarity can’t help but admire Spike as he works. He certainly does make for an impressive and powerful figure, and he only becomes more so with time. Perhaps Spike doesn’t realize he’s accidentally putting on a show for her, but then again, perhaps he does. It certainly wouldn’t be the first time they’d shown off to each other… like when Rarity had shown him a new maternity dress, oh so very long ago. As a dragon god, Spike is rather proud of his achievements and knows Rarity loves him with all her heart. He definitely intends to keep her close to his side for the rest of eternity, immortalizing her within his very domain… because of the children they created.  About ten years have passed since they’ve created the universe. Both Spike and Rarity have had their fair share of friskiness, impregnating more magical beings while their magic ages them even more. Spike is usually impregnated while wearing a more elaborate outfit, such as his extremely long leather skirt and hot pink pussycat sweater combo. Rarity still enjoys using sex as a way to infuse more magical life into her body, which is clearly evident when Spike’s enormous, thick, giant cock thrusts inside her while she wears her light brown, frilly robe. For these ten years, Spike’s sex life has been non-stop, with his lust for Rarity never having been quenched…or at least the lust was somewhat used up, until now.  It’s been months since Spike’s semen made its way into Rarity’s womb, but the magic is still able to grow new baby flesh in both of their wombs. The two of them are still quite young, only three or four years on the grand scale, so the magic of children is not necessary. But the magical still allows Spike’s enormous cock to expand and grow more fully, and once again Spike’s teeth and beard are not long enough to enclose his mouth and give him full control of his breathing. Rarity, though, has grown into an even more beautiful and charming woman. Her hair is more lustrous than ever, and has been magically tamed so it follows her, dancing on top of her head in an endlessly fascinating pattern, each lock shimmering like diamond dust. Rarity’s eyes are still silver and sharp, although they’re a little more round than they used to be. She’s gained a few less pigtails over the years, as well.  Spike is still in a lustful, permanent “man-lust” state, since Rarity’s womb produces impregnable offspring.        i saw this from someone else so i copy their homework and made this using ai"

Mother****ers are earning billion a month and the f***ing game is still full of bugs
"Very fun game, the story mode is incredibly fun in my opinion, and playing online is incredible too, even if its only in private lobbies or with friends.  The game has basically near infinite replay value in the SINGE PLAYER mods.  so yea, i like the game."
this game is just amazing there is nothing else to say
i can not mod it
This game would be 5/5 but cheating problem is still quite visible.

FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME ROCKSTAR

hackers make it hard to enjoy online but overall an  interesting game to play with your friends.

"Still amazing, even after all those years...   now, where is at least a trailer for VI huh?  XD"

"Dont like the pc version too many modders in lobby, money milking org ; Rockstar dont do shit about it, and bans innocent player for no reason."
best game around i have it for pc playstation 5 and 3 and 4
This game has the most amounts of modders in every game. This game isnt a free map game but a 50/50 coin flip to see if the modders are nice or not.
saya tidak bisa bermain roleplay kontollllllllllll
This is good for your mental health.
"as a modder, I still enjoy the game, I enjoy doing cayo perico and casino heists with people, etc. also riding with people on Mount Chilliad, simply the best game for the money, it's worth"
game trash as hell

a level 20 absolutely bombed me for 20 hours straight then i got mods and got banned for 20 years. when i came back i became the level 20 tryhard 10/10 very nice and respectfull gta online community

"Requires rockstar social account, lost access to said account, R* support is of no help, I can no longer play GTAV, will no longer purchase from R*."
i personally felt very satisfied coz i waiting for a long time to play this and since i wasn't having a good system to play a heavy game like this but when i got a good one and played this ..the moment was on another level and having patience for this was the best decision i've ever made. The game is full of adventures and entertainment ..would recommend this to everyone out there and those haven't played this yet ..go give it a try i'm damn sure you'll love it and will get addicted to this just like me ..

"slip inside the eye of your mind, dont you know you might find, a better place to play"
"Following recent updates and poor management of content I will no longer be playing this game, if it was even possible to refund the game at this stage I would, don't buy this game now it has everything it used to, and even less after they removed vehicles from the shops and changed the grind of the game to be more painful than actually time consuming, in every money making strategy there is that one mission that ""might"" come up that wastes time and is difficult to complete, in addition to being very buggy, I'd recommend going elsewhere to play around with cars and shoot cops, other games do it better."

i got a smol pp and when i wach this i becom the rock
very adicting
(talking about online) played 144 hours and its a really fun game but the only thing to do when you have everything is just to get mods or grief so i recommend it for your spare time as its a pretty long game and story mode is good too but online is just better in my opinion but overall loved it
i would differently recommend this game its awesome.
All time best game for me
"So, the story mode in this game? It's a real joy. You can just cruise around, have fun, and get lost in the game world. But let's talk about the online mode, where things take a frustrating turn due to those pesky modders.  Trying to get a simple Heist prep done becomes an ordeal when modders are lurking around. They can blow you up or take you out as soon as you're about to reach your destination. It feels like they're everywhere, on almost every server. Even if you try to report them, it's often futile because they can crash your game and erase any trace of your report from Rockstar's system, leaving them scot-free.  These modders aren't just satisfied with ruining gameplay; they also spam the in-game chat with ads, making it beyond annoying. What's worse, their activities can make the servers lag due to the sheer volume of their antics. Today, I ran into a modder who, at first, seemed like a savior by freeing me from a submarine another modder had trapped me in. But then, they turned the tables by making my character no-clip, sending me soaring into the sky, and then plummeting me to my death. They also teleported me away from my destination just when I was about to reach it. All in all, the online experience on these servers is nothing short of a disaster.  To sum it up, while the story mode is all fun and games, the online mode is marred by these modders who take the fun out of it and create a pretty frustrating environment for players."

"Great story, and the heist are actually pretty fun and the game, and you have a lot of freedom, highly recommend it."
"An actual amazing game lying beneath a thick coat of broken gameplay and horrible updates.  This game is like the most abusive partner you could ever have.  And though i still have an unexplainable fondness of the game. I seriously cant stomach how unplayable every session has become. Plagued with the same issues repeating themselves, everytime you load up the game. From the horribly laced servers, terrible game stability/crashes, Horrible framerate/peformance drops, Graphical Glitches, and last but not least, getting stuck in a fucking loading screen. And even if you manage to fight through all that, with you sanity left. Then comes the Recycled content/Removal Of Beloved Content, Uninspiring Updates, Constant Phone Calls, and last but not least, modders.  I really love this game. But it definetly has much to come back for, and so much enjoyability. But with all the issues stated above, its simply impossibly for me to have fun playing this game. I just feel iritated.   I recommend you buy this game, because it is with no do doubt a classic, and the story mode is phenomenal (and actually pretty replayable imo) But beaware of the journey of Love, and Rage ahead of you."
this game has boobies
We do quite a considerable amount of mental trickery and mockery of those who are unfortunate enough to fall victim to our clever little trap of social teasing. *laughs in upper class*
NOT GOOD FOR KIDS but good for adults  lot guns cars i would give an 8/10
my auto has been grand thefted  just don't play online unless you're fine with hackers giving you cash and unlocking literally every collectible for you out of nowhere
Perfection

"This game is no longer deserving of my respect, i simply cant enjoy it anymore. I just want a new rockstar game"
Best Open World Game.
this game runs like dog shit on mid to high level pcs and im sick and tired of getting 40 fps and the digital security rockstar offers is next to nothing i have been kicked out of this game so many times dont buy this poop and if you would like to have some major pc truble then buy it if you come from xbox or ps 4-5 you cant and i say cant get data from there to your pc i lost 3000 hours of game play to this data bs

I GOT KILLED BY A HACKER good game recommend nothing happened with my experience 10\10
"Very nice game with very nice story mode. Online is also decent, but would've been better off without these futuristic stuff. Recommended!"
"Single player is great as long as you don't get hacked and your ip address revealed on the internet. Multiplayer is absolute trash on pc with nothing but modders. Suffer from a glitch? Support is a joke. ROCKSTAR DOESN'T TAKE CARE OF IT'S GAMES. They don't care about you, they don't care about the modders, all they want is for you to buy shark cards like the good little consumer you are."
*monke sounds*
very good game i played this game at my free ttime for timepass ......
mi opp in the hose nope
wow. i have only really played it for a bit but it is a very good game to get sucked into. this game is like the concept for a GOOD game.

yes it was very good game
Bullying homeless people is Fun
"even after 10 years it takes years to fkin load in. I have no clue why they are not optimising this. And if the game is over 60 fps a mission will get interrupted. Without vsync some others will be failed. But all that being said, one of the greatest games ever."
fgfrhfhhf
VERY GOOD GAME EVERY ONE SHOULD TRY THIS ITS AN AWESOME GAME ......
Excllent Game...
this game  i have played for 4 years now i  enjoy this game espelshele when you mod the game
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Rockstar deliberately withholds content from PC players that Xbox One and PS5 players get access to.
very hard money
A relaxing game that I enjoy playing with my brother and a good friend.

"HEY! I KNOW YOUR KINDA HUNGRY BUT DO I GOT A GOOD TAMALES GUIDE FOR YOU!  step by step so you cant miss it  INGREDIENTS FOR THE FILLING: 1 pound boneless pork shoulder 1/2 large white onion 2 cloves garlic, divided 1 bay leaf 1 pound tomatillos 4 serrano peppers 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning  FOR THE DOUGH: 1 large package dried corn husks (about 1 pound) 2 pounds fresh masa for tamales (purchased from a tortillería; not masa preparada), or 3 cups masa harina for tamales 1/2 to 3 cups salted chicken broth (not low-sodium) 1 1/4 cups canola oil 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  EQUIPMENT: Steamer pot Large pot or bowl Medium saucepan Stand mixer or electric hand mixer Tongs Blender Strainer Slotted spoon Chef’s knife or paring knife, and cutting board Measuring cups and spoons  INSTRUCTIONS STEP 1: Soak the corn husks. Place 1 package corn husks in a large pot or bowl and add enough hot tap water to cover. Make sure the husks are submerged by weighing them down with a few coffee mugs.  STEP 2: Cook the pork. Cut 1 pound pork shoulder into 2-inch chunks. Season with kosher salt and black pepper. Place in a large saucepan. Cut 1/2 large white onion into 2 pieces, and add 1 piece to the pan. Add 1 of the garlic cloves, 1 bay leaf, and 2 1/2 cups water. Bring to a simmer over high heat, about 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the pork is fork tender and falling apart, stirring every 20 minutes to prevent the bottom of the pot from burning, 1 to 1 1/2 hours total. Meanwhile, start the chile sauce.  STEP 3: Cook the chile sauce ingredients. Husk and rinse 1 pound tomatillos. Place in a medium saucepan. Add the remaining onion piece, remaining garlic clove, and 4 serrano peppers, and cover with 1 inch of cold water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the items have softened, about 8 minutes for the tomatillos and peppers, and 12 minutes for the onion and garlic. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the items to a bowl as they are ready. Let cool slightly, then coarsely chop the peppers (discarding any tough stems), onion, and garlic.  STEP 4: Cool the meat. When the pork is ready, use a slotted spoon and transfer it to a bowl. Remove 1/4 cup of the broth for the sauce. Let the pork cool slightly, then shred with your fingers or two forks.  STEP 5: Blend the sauce. Place the tomatillos, chopped chiles, onion, garlic, and 1/4 cup broth in a blender and blend until smooth.  STEP 6: Combine the sauce and meat. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a medium saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add the sauce in one quick pour. Stir in the shredded pork. Add 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a boil and cook for 3 to 4 minutes to let the flavors meld. The filling should taste salty—it needs to be saltier than you’d think, to stand out inside the tamales. Remove from the heat and set aside.  STEP 7: Knead the dough. If using masa harina for your dough, place 3 cups masa harina in a deep mixing bowl and pour in 2 1/4 cups chicken broth. Mix with your hands until the dough is moist and soft. If using fresh masa, knead 1/2 cup chicken broth into 2 pounds masa with your hands until a firm dough forms.  STEP 8: Mix the dough. Pour 1 1/4 cups canola oil into a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, use an electric hand mixer and large bowl.) With the mixer on low speed — and don’t wear your best clothing, because it will splatter — add the masa in golf-ball-sized pieces one at a time. The dough may look rather lumpy and unattractive here, but it will eventually transform. Stop the mixer and sprinkle in 2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder. If using masa harina, stir in an extra 1/2 cup chicken broth. Mix on high speed until the dough is very light and fluffy, about 10 minutes more.  STEP 9: Spread the dough inside the husks. Remove 1 corn husk from the water and wipe off any extra water with a towel. Use a rubber spatula to spread about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of dough (the amount depends on the size of the corn husk) in a large rectangle. Leave a few inches of space at the top so the dough doesn’t burst out once it’s cooking, and leave about 3 inches of space at the narrower end of the leaf so you have room to fold it.  STEP 10: Add the homemade filling. Add a small amount of the pork filling (about 2 tablespoons) in a line down the center of the tamal. Don’t add too much, or else it will spill out of the husk when you’re folding it.  STEP 11: Fold the tamales closed. To close the tamale, bring one side of the tamal toward the other, like an empanada or a taco, and press lightly to seal. Then tuck the leaves of the husk over each other into a tube-shape. Press down on the narrower end to seal, then fold up toward the wider end. Set aside folded side down and repeat with the remaining tamales.  STEP 12: Steam the tamales for 35 minutes. Add water to a steamer pot and line the insert with a layer of corn husks. (This helps keep the steam trapped inside and adds a bit of flavor.) Bring the water to a light boil. Place the tamales vertically, open-side up in the steamer, but don’t pack them too tightly or they won’t have room to expand. Cover with some extra corn husks. Cover and steam until the corn husk easily pulls away from the tamal, about 35 minutes.  STEP 13: Let the tamales cool 10 to 15 minutes. Don’t eat the tamales immediately after you remove them from the pot, as they’ll be too soft still. Let the tamales cool for 10 to 15 minutes — they’ll firm up quite a bit and be ready to eat.  AND THERE YOU GO ENJOY!"
voi helvetti
DEWWWW
only way to make this game fun is with mods
amazing it is like real life
its one of the best
Thank You Very Much
easy to run and there is way to much fun to have with this game

"Great Story, Great Gameplay, Singleplayer is great. Multiplayer is cheatinfested and rockstar is moneyhungry so grinding money is ultra tedious to the point of not being fun, feels like a mobile game playing online, the cheaters dont make it any better. this game is literally the biggest cheaterinfested game i played in my entire life not even counterstrike can compare.  only giving this a ""YES"" because of the Singleplayer Campaign."
"This game is good, never played online but the story mode is amazing."
Can't play the story mode offline on the steam deck
hambuger

One of the best games to ever be made. Thank god for GTA RP Servers also. Best time of your lives on those servers.
"this game is great and fun, i love playing it with all my friends"
Get mods if you dont care about online makes the game go by wayy faster. if u care about online dont get mods. 10/10
don't buy shark cards
yes \
very fun to mod
Overrated as hell but still incredible
et gud
crazy boobs
guns killing and fun and blood
glad this game still gets updates even though it is 10 years old
"got doxxed, somone threatend my life, some mf sends me a pic of my own house... i think ill stick to story mode"

"I no longer have the old fivem account and it won't let me connect to the one on steam or rockstar, how can I fix the situation?"

"Been playing since the Xbox 360 days and I can feel this era is about to close. It's been real y'all, here's to GTA VI c:"
very nice fun game when playing with friends
"Amazing game, truly worth the wait for the downloading time, but trust me, its too addictive"
its all we have till GTA6 2024-25.
"This game is horrendous. Owned since day one, came back to replay after a couple of years only to find it now requires a launcher to be downloaded, and my game key is no longer valid?! wtf, rockstar? you just expect people to pay for a new copy of the game? nah. go play literally any other game. Rockstar has ruined their entire lineup of games and hopefully will be cast into oblivion by their own ineptitude very soon."
fun game but its 18+ dont give it to your kid if you have one
"Really fun game I hvae played it on ps 3, ps 4, xbox and pc and still love this game and have played it for mutiple years but feel it is best on PC :D"
good and well designed game. Recommended
"online system broken, crashes and glitches galore"
"I missed the window, where we could move our characters from PS to PC, by a few days because I was on vacation / no internet. Appealed a few days later, and even-though I bought this game literally 3 times and bought shark cards Rock* said ""too bad"".  0/10 Not going to grind same sh*t 4 times"
Hello

very good i really like it
BADASS game
Guns and cars and chaos
"GREAT GAME, WAITING FOR GTA IV TO COME OUT!"
I really love this game.. I grew up with this game. But the amount of modders and how Rockstar fails to prevent them from modding is absolutely destroy this game. I don't know how to say this and I Hate to say is.. I do not recommend this game.  Unless you're here for the story and the single player content.
its gta bro
"a very good game, worth it after i dried out my nerves waiting for the game to install"

"GTA 5 is brilliant, i love it too bits and everything about the game is perfect... almost. you see even though i am leaving a positive review on this game due to how great it actually is, there is an issue. One single issue that makes the game a little worse than it can be. The cop system in this game isn't great. There is no real way of putting it but it really does kinda suck just a little bit in my opinion. At the time of writing this i have roughly around 20 hours of game play and i think i can say with all honesty that the cops in this game are not the best. it makes a game about committing crimes no longer really feel like it as you constantly have  to worry about the whole system. I think the star system is great, it makes sense and it's easy to understand but just because of how the cops are in this game, it makes it feel more like just an annoyance. please don't take this as a `don't buy this game` kind of review. the game is terrific and i really mean that, it's nearly perfect. i just think the cops could be worked on a little bit and thinking about how a game based around crime can be so easily shadowed upon by the police system within the game. Really do buy the game anyway. It is outstanding, just good it really is but be warned about how the police works in this game, Its very... different to say it lightly."
"Great game. Been years of unyielding fun. not recommended for anyone under 25 but definitely no one under 18 should be playing this. very violent, a ton of sex and drug references, characters break pretty much every law you can think of short of hurting children, as well as the most foul language in any game. If you're looking for a way to live a virtual criminal double life free of any consequences, this is the game for you."
can start illegal drug bussisines and mardar
One of my favorite games. Story Mode 10/9 Overall 10/9.5
gbrdfcxgdb
the game constantly crashes and i have to start it at least 3 times to get into online modus müsst ihr selber wissen LIebe Grüße
It's GTA V... This game speaks for itself. Online is a love hate thing. It's 2023 and they have made changes that really amplify money making and you can eliminate any and all threats from the toxic community by just having your own friend sessions where you can manage your businesses without issues. To me that's been the biggest and best change made to this decade old masterpiece. All I've ever wanted was piece and quiet when doing my business missions. Thanks to that change my empire cranks out money left and right.
EEEEEEE
Gta online is a cesspool but aside from that the story is underrated asf! Great replay value aswell
drugs 👍
"got hacked on my old account was given a large amount of money tried contacting rockstar, didnt respond instead they wiped my account thanks rockstar :)"

Best game ever have spent a lot of time doing the cayo perico heist and racking in all of the money. GTA is the best criminal action game that is out there period. Trust me I have played this game long enough to recommend it to other people because of how good it is. Also can’t wait for gta 6.keep up the good work rockstar!
Online Modders. No thank you
to be quite frank there is nothing grand about this game nor am i a THIEF if you play this game you need to REPENT. how dare you steal from members of the general public... really think about your actions! when i am thinking about it it makes me sad because they will have no money and yeah i have money but like what do i do with all that cash???? i LIED I GO AND CRY INTO MY GAZILLIONS IDIOTS I WOULD NEVER CARE I AM GRAND. ROTUND. LARGE AT THEFT. NOT VERY AUTO BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE A DRIVERS LICENSE BUT THAT IS OK MY FATHER WILL DRIVE ME :3
rockstar is legend
it has boobs
"To say ""Grand Theft Auto V"" (2013) is an amazing experience in (almost) every possible way is like to say nothing. This game is pure and simple masterpiece. I won't say anything new that wasn't said millions times before. GTA V is a must own and play for almost anyone who enjoys perfect games."
its amazing and fun
fantasic game just need to hurry up with gta 6 lol

its realy fun if you dont like it thats fine>

ITS VERY GOOD.
"A wonderful game, full of endless things to do and it's really hard to get bored if you keep an open mind. I personally love the game modes, Arena was one of the best updates to ever come out for a video game, even if it was a massive investment with little return.   Unfortunately, no amount of role playing or amazing updates could ever rid the modders, no amount of vast cash cards could save us. For modders, they always win, children can mod, they don't die, they have infinite money. I don't see how they can play longer than 5 minutes and get bored, but, every lobby has at least one, usually 5.  The only saving hope is that the first 6 months of GTA6 will be clear of modders, maybe it can feel like a real game again without being bombed into San Andres just for saying a modder had a flare up of tiny pp syndrome."
GTA V Online really brings out my blackness.
peak gaming
lester take too much money from my heists
FUCKKING SUCKS
guy $
every time i log on my pc i have to get the internet to work for the game and this is the only game it happens to
This games story is top tear and amazing in general the grand theft auto V story is outstanding and deserves an oscar. There is nothing bad i can say about this game it's perfect and the best game i would recommend this game any time of the year.
"the same s**t for 10 years, still can be both irritating and fun."

It is so fun
FUN GAME
"yeah shit at this point man  idk if its the mods i was tryna use or not but the rockstar launcher recently fucks over and rapes all the mods i try n install only able to install basic trainers and newer mods that arent that requiring.  if u wanna just buy the game for its modding then dont, just dont. now wishing i could refund this piece of trash game but here we are.."
best.
"Played this 10 years ago, and enjoyed playing through the story mode again, good old clean wholesome fun for the whole family.  :)"

very good game and i LIKE IT :)
Very good game. Rockstar please remove the mkII :pray:
good game. I'm rich.
vERY FUN
Yes king
It was worth it i love this game and its my childhood i never regret having this game
fun non-competitive game that has proven itself for ten years online is infested with modders and hackers but invite only lobbies exist too so it wouldn't bother you and your friends if you want to drive around the map and enjoy the game
i like that game so much
"Lots of fun, nothing like committing crimes with friends and family!"
i died like 19 times
everything is best except servers.
i am in offline mode and don't know how to turn on online mode now i can't play online
Still pretty good for 10 years old. Lots of fun to be had with friends in online mode. Good single player game.  Cons: loading sim sometimes in online mode. 'modders' a plenty
"HELL YEAH MAN, IM TREVOR IRL"

"I had a lot of fun initially until I realized that the only thing worth doing are the main missions. The driving and combat feel great.  The game is full of side activities that I didn't find worth doing after a while. I miss the gang wars and dynamism that older games like GTA San Andreas had. It kind of feels like there's nothing to do outside of the main story which is a shame considering the size and scope of the game. Even when I bought new properties, it kind of felt pointless and underwhelming. They also seem to tease a heist system that I never could engage with outside of the main missions.  The humor and tone is ridiculous and entertaining. At least it has that going for it!  6/10"

it's still fun game i recommend
very nice game love this
played for 23 hours and can confirm i commited grand theft auto 5 times
"new players, go to the shoe shop its good!"
"This game is awesome fun! Best purchase of my life, I have 200+ hours and still haven't gotten bored."
best game i have played yet. i really recomend it.
great for releasing stress
5 STAR!
"Single player was great, the characters were well thought out and the voice acting was spot on, especially Trevor. I still don't love the control system of the character but everything else is a nice experience. Multiplayer is fun with friends or randoms, I made a couple more gaming friends from this game and play other games with them. The cheaters are around in this game but they can't do much with bought cheats, and hackers you can report and get them banned but most of the time they aren't a game ruining experience like Red Dead Online."
hoyaa
great game remebedr
"Both story and online mode are great, playing at the end of 2023 and still worth it."
"Steam tells lies, I've sunk WAY more hours than told on here..."
doge
The story mode is amazing. Great character development and design. The multiplayer is another thing..... Modders at war with eachother in every lobby makes the game near unplayable. Loading screens taking forever to work and thats if you dont get stuck in loading screen limbo. The multiplayer has just turned into a broken and beaten cash grab like how does a game like rust's anticheat beat out a AAA game companies Anti-Cheat.
wow really noice game go buy now
fun for those above the age of 10 and the story is really good
Very fun open world and story packed with content and funny moments
"i love to play this game, both the story and online mood are great. even we can play RP by joinig server in fiveM"
"Amazing game, I have it on my xbox 360, one & PC. Spent over 1000 hours in online mode only, and single has 300 hours.  downvoting only because they recently added a new ""Rockstar Launcher"" which makes me unable to play the story game (offline) with no internet connection because it needs to verify that I bought the game that I am launching from STEAM???? Makes this game unplayable on my steam deck because it is literally offline whenever I am on the go. This was not like this in the past, we did not have this BS third party launcher."
"GTAV was a good game, but Rockstar has done a terrible job with its online mode. Each lobby you enter has hackers in it, and the grind from when you start is terrible. Besides all the hackers and the annoying grind, I actually really like this game and think it is worth playing. A lot of the heists and game modes manage to make the game quite enjoyable for me."

really good gane
"The base game it's alright, the story will take you around 20 hours to complete including all the side missions, after that all you have left to do is busy work, collect 50 of those collect 50 of that, find 100 of these, the game itself is replayable to a certain exten but the outcomes are not that different from each other.  What gains it the negative review for me is the online part of the game, every single little thing is designed to make you want to buy shark cards, every part of the gameplay is walled behind millions of ""dollars"" that you'll have to spend hundreds of hours gathering by playing the same mission 100 times or buying a shark card, the public lobbies are a s***show, the game has been abbandoned in that aspect, the publisher and developers gave up on that a long time ago, modders and account sellers rule the online aspect of the game, the things that you can do by yourself are very limited and if you want to do all of it it's virtually impossible because everyone is either out there godmode griefing low levels or running the same 2 missions over and over to save enough money to buy a specific car or whatever else."
The modders are EVERYWHERE and make the game impossible to play. THEY GO UNPUNISHED. There seems to be no anticheat whatsoever. It cant be that hard to notice players teleporting and killing other players across the map...
i play every day and night no touching grass
Very good game I liked it and definitely great to recommend to others
"whoever keeps spawning strippers with rocket launchers should jump off a cliff, i also hate anybody who would even think about buying the oppressor mk2 do the same."

"I really enjoy this game! I'm not the best at the heists and stuff, but its still a fun thing to try! I like being able to edit cars and make them look how you want them to. There's so many options to pick from. It's also great with friends! But the only downside is the hackers. I logged in one day and this guy had put a boat, a plane and a lot of random crap in my home garage. I was annoyed at first. But looking back on it, it was pretty funny."

AMEZING GAEM LOVE IT
yes i would
It's GTA does that even need a description. Still the hit game it was 7 years ago but GTA 6 could not come at a better time
The game itself is great but for some reason it keeps randomly making the screen go black and i cannot figure out how to fix it.  anyway i suggest you buy it and hopefully it will work for you.

currently runs like crap but will definitely play more when I get a new pc
"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a modder. Mostly, half of a lobby is filled with Godmode players. Some are also griefers and will crash your game just because they can."
Yes!
what's there to say. damn.
buh
ehh its ok
I had sex with a hooker and then shot her dead... The whole game went silent and I had actually felt like i had killed something i nutted in. Weirdly disturbing experience. 10/10  GTA online gets rated an astounding -10/10 but if you manage to come across a friendly hacker it's an 11/10 completely redeeming the experience
Don't

qwedqwdqwd
"good graphic, good story. This game is definitely one of the best games i ever played"
"Broken mess with all the hackers that rockstar can't be arsed to ban or block from the game, and the fact that the loyalty award for completing the heists with the same people is broken, was supposed to get 2.6 mil in total, got a big whopping $0 from it, although the only money i got from the heist finale was from doing the set-ups which only gave me 400k, all in all, I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone as rockstar is really milking this game for the money and not fixing it for the fans."
good game but it won't let me in the game

"good game, love cutting up"
i hate Modders :)
prob the best game i have ever played
The Best grand theft auto until probably the next one. GTA is a money sink.
"It has a wonderful storyline which is full of chaos. The gameplay is awesome, and it takes skill and practice to get good."
"shoot, die, shoot, die, drive car, drive bus, drive truck, fly plane, fly helicopter, they added submarine? wtf is this game now lmaooooo"
it's prettyt farting cool probably i peed myself a little bit when i went to the strip club saw boobers

"As a man who's been playing it on XBOX for a while, then got it on steam, its quite a good game, only if you're not easily offended and sensitive to cursing, gore, and more things, i'm sensitive to naked and half-naked women, so i don't go to a percentage of the map. but, its a good game, er.-"
GOOD GAME!
best game of course! still waiting for gta VI tho
i ilke what your games rockstar
Ive nearly got 1000 hours on this game and it makes me want to kill my self
IF YOUR NOT A SCREECHING FOUR YEAR OLD I would highly recommend.  Parents just be aware this game is not for your kids do not buy it for them.

"This is one of my favorite games even to this day 10 years later! I have played much more then what my steam account says, between playing around with mods as well as play on both PS3 and PS4 before I purchased a PC. I’d say I have well over 1000 hours in GTA V and haven’t regretted a second of it, and now at the price it’s at its a no brainer, super fun alone 10x better with friends"
"I like the giant sphere of reality in the game. I hate the alien weapons and vehicles that ruin what the game is great for, realism."

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is the quintessential open-world game, and even years after its initial release, it stands as a testament to the sheer brilliance of Rockstar Games. The game's arrival on Steam marks an opportunity for gamers old and new to immerse themselves in the sprawling, chaotic, and endlessly captivating world of Los Santos.  Set in the fictional state of San Andreas, GTA V tells the intertwining tales of three complex characters: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking a life of luxury; Franklin, a skilled repo man eager to escape the streets; and Trevor, a maniacal force of nature with an insatiable appetite for chaos. The storytelling is nothing short of cinematic, drawing players into a world of high-stakes heists, betrayals, and a satirical take on modern American culture.  The first thing that hits you when you enter Los Santos is the sheer scope of the world. The city is a living, breathing entity, with its inhabitants going about their daily lives, contributing to the feeling that you're part of something much larger. The attention to detail is staggering, from the sparkling skyscrapers to the gritty, crime-infested neighborhoods. The game world is a playground that oozes authenticity.  GTA V is not just about the story; it's about the freedom it offers. You can jump into countless side activities, from racing and sports to skydiving and base-jumping. The world is your oyster, and the depth of content is astounding. The heists, in particular, are standout moments that showcase the game's strategic depth and cinematic flair.  Gameplay is a perfect blend of shooting, driving, and general mayhem. The controls are tight, and the variety of vehicles at your disposal makes exploration enjoyable. The shooting mechanics are top-notch, and the cover system is a godsend during intense gunfights. Whether you're evading the police, chasing down criminals, or just cruising through the city, the gameplay is endlessly engaging.  Online multiplayer is where GTA V truly shines. GTA Online takes everything great about the single-player experience and lets you share it with friends or compete against other players in a massive, ever-evolving world. From heists to races, free roam activities, and ambitious player-created content, GTA Online provides a seemingly limitless array of experiences, all while allowing you to build your criminal empire.  Visually, GTA V still impresses, even years after its release. The PC version on Steam offers the best graphics, with support for high resolutions, detailed textures, and customizable settings that make the game look even more breathtaking. The attention to detail extends to the dynamic weather and day-night cycle, which contribute to the immersive experience.  While GTA V is a masterpiece, it's not without its controversy, particularly due to its mature themes, violence, and satirical commentary. However, for those who can appreciate the game for what it is—an open-world work of art—it offers a thrilling and unforgettable experience.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V on Steam is a must-have for any gaming enthusiast. It's a testament to the boundless creativity and ambition of Rockstar Games, offering a world that's a playground for chaos, storytelling, and exploration. If you haven't yet experienced the brilliance of Los Santos, there's never been a better time to dive in and see what all the hype is about."

"The single player is legendary of course.  But online? this game is literally nothing but hackers/ griefers. It is actually astounding how many of them there are. Not even worth it unless you too are cheating I guess. Hackers are in random missions, death matches, races you name it. none of them are playable.   You cant even roam around in a free roam lobby without some toxic clown emptying your inventory of all weapons, changing your car, making your car fly across the map, or blow up 1000 times in a second to crash your game. For that I honestly can not recommend this game to anyone. Watching paint dry is more fun than this game is online."
game is ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
amazing prostitutes. but also an incredible story and super free to play. i love murdering innocent npc's.
"Decided to do my first fooligan job just now since I recently came back from a break and I wish I never came back. My homing missiles would either fly under the vehicle I was locked onto or just go straight past it, the insurgents had marksman aim even when I wasn't facing them, after both my helicopters got destroyed I got in my car and just got demolished by a missile, the insurgents were sat behind hills lasering me and the other merry weather guards were sat behind trees killing me in like one shot. Once I even tried running down a hill after checking it was clear and got headshot from a helicopter that literally spawned right in front of me. Don't get me wrong I love challenging gun fights but when it takes me half an hour to finish one part of not even a proper mission it's just taking the piss"

"This game is recommended, no debate."
"fun single-player story run multiplayer feels kinda slow (not sure if they improved this yet) and complex for a player like me, it could've been a 9.5/10 experience for me but yea from the cons i would give the whole package an 8.75/10"
time consuming
im need to gift ppl shark cards
"Game has kicked me for the last time, I think I'm actually done with it.   Between the bugs, the cheaters, the terribly toxic fan base and now Rock star becoming even more greedy... I think it's time to move on to greener pastures.   The Prioritization of monetization has gone too far, and I do not think the next GTA will be any better."

"But I think the reason why it's been popular among gamers is because it's a very good game.” “GTA” games are known for their deep, well-developed stories and hip, wry writing. The characters are complex, the environments are spot-on, the game soundtracks are germane to the time and place."

"GTA V was apart of many childhoods including mine. Before it got butchered with online updates.  Pros:  - Graphics, especially it being first released on Old Gen consoles, that have less then a GB of RAM by the way. (The PS3 had 512MB and The Xbox 360 also had 512 MB)  - Physics, despite it being a downgrade compared to GTA IV, its still very great and way ahead of its time.  - Open World, to this day, GTA V is probably the greatest free roam of all time in an open world. The cars, movies, buying clothing, robberies, really anything you can think of honestly.  - Story, its just iconic. Three main characters, living the American Dream.  - RAGE Engine, now this is somewhat apart of the Graphics section I mentioned, but I have to talk about the fact that this Engine got made 10+ years ago. And still holds up to this particular day and age. Absolutely amazing.  - Map Design, Los Santos is a really great map, just a very well made replica of LA.  - The Modding capabilites, I to this day. Play this game Modded, FiveM, the VR Mod, Steering wheel support, Trainers, it really blows out the competition in different games that dont come with modding support.  - AtD (Attention to Detail) R* has added alot of AtD to GTA V, like the flip flops that Michael can wear, literally flip flop!  - The Radio, the music catalogue in GTA V is very fitting and well thought of R* to increase the immersion and make it really feel like a Radio Station, the announcers, the music, the licenses, its pretty great honestly.  Cons:  - Alot parts of the map, are ""Wasteland"" what do I mean by saying this? well... despite the map being pretty large. Theres alot of spots that are just hills, sand, and it just gets repititive like ""Oh hey, I have been here before?""  - All side-characters are in my opinion, very irritating. Despite for example people like ""Debra"" while Trevor lived at Vespucci. Even though we only get to really see her once in a cutscene before she got killed by Trevor, you really could tell how much of an annoyance she would have been if she didnt die.  - GTAO, back then it was more about being a criminal in online and really playing like it was meant to be. Nowadays its filled with Jets, MK2, and shark cards that get bought with moms credit cards... lovely.  Overall:  If your looking for a great SP game, good Graphics even nowadays, and modding capabilites. Then you should definetly buy this! However, the online is at an all time low. Its not necessarily great and as mentioned, its filled with people who just blow you up, so if you really want to play online. Just go into Passive Mode."

Very good game I love the online edition. Although sometimes there are some glitches which crash my game. But overall a very nice game.
"Sure, one of the best game of 2013. GTA Online? No, never heard of it.  (No ouch.)"
I have been called the nword more times than my hours on this game (it was from just 1 person that i dont even know in a public session). Thank you Rockstar.

don't ask me why this game is good
Efing Awesome
it be goooooooooddddd game
"I am a 35 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 16 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
Rockstar killed Luke Ross's R.E.A.L. VR mod for GTA V.
"retarded social club and support, mediocre company so out of touch"
"This is one of the funniest outrageous games ever.  Humor in most everything.  A parody of life in Los Angeles. The story is great fun. You can play any one of the three main characters at any time (after you play through some of the story), and for a short time, a dog.  Listen to the many funny non-playable characters voices. The missions are challenging. And even when you don't feel like following the story, you can experiment as much as you want, explore the sandbox that is its open world.  I have played numerous hours every so often since  the game was released. I find it a good stress relief from a tough day at work, forget about things for a while.  If you have never played this masterpiece, I highly recommend you try it!"
Story mode - 10/10 online - nvm

too much fun!
"No overarching plot leads to events feeling very disconnected. It's got a very inconsistent tone, it both doesn't take itself seriously and takes itself too seriously.   Let's compare this to GTA IV. GTA IV had a dark, gritty tone and serious story. Despite this, it was still able to crack jokes at times and be lighthearted. Most of all, the jokes didn't suck and weren't dropped every 5 minutes. GTA IV's missions also all connected together and interwove a tight plot that was entertaining.  I suppose it plays fine, but it's just really meh otherwise."
good game but i need mony
Great Game even 10 years after its release. Great Graphics and great to play with friends
"Listen, just buy it. You came to this page, you're here for GTA Online. Buy it."
GTA5 is still the most played age restricted game for a reason + GTA5 campaign has Trevor + GTA5 online has free expansions and weekly deals - GTA5 online on PC has cheaters. (You can change servers to avoid cheaters or Orbital Cannon them until they leave)  - Rockstar put vehicles behind paywall and betrayed me after heist - Stunt camera killed me - Every expansion injures a GTA6 developer
"If you play with someone to fund every little thing you do, this game is phenomenal. Just needed that virtual sugar daddy."
It is so fun and would highly recommend
i like to shoot the homless people
it good :)
i lick everything
i could play this game on my laptop it worth it a AMD SILVER  10/10
I love this game so hard. What a masterpiece. I wish there were more buildings I could enter though.

yeah this game is good i mean everyone knows gta 5 is the shit . DUh
this gamelit
not shit opressor mk2 (greifer flying bike) is now 8 million
very good game ever
"It's GTAV. I don't care for the online aspect of it, but the Single Player offerings have been more than enough to   to bring me back to Los Santos time and again through the years. Some missions are a slog, specially the ones where you need to cross the map on a truck or some other slow vehicle, but there are widely available quality of life mods that make these kinds of activities much more bearable, such as the autodrive options in something like ENT — a must have for me personally."
"When I first payed it I was not impressed. But ten years later, after a decade going backward in terms of games quality, I can say this game is a masterpiece.   Still worth it in 2023, the graphics are still surprisingly good, the scenario is all you can expect from this type of game, and the city is just amazing.   Also, if you like this game, please try ""Sleeping Dogs"", still also worth it in 2023, with better hand to hand combats and amazing car chases."
GTA will never get old its the best game ever❤❤
wonderful
The best abusive relationship to be apart of <3
I like thhis game so muchh Thia is multiplayer and story mode race game

its a game an it does game stuff cause its a game where your able to game so i say its pretty gameable
"I like this game a lot. But I wish they had bonobos in the game, that would make it much better because I like bonobos."
THE LEGENDS IS BACK!!!
best open world and online game must give it a shot
Best multiplayer game out there...long live Dr. Dre
"This game requires you to link asocial club account. If you forget that email, ever, you can never play the game again. You have to repurchase it on a new account. Rockstar customer support will ignore you. Just pirate it."
VERY FUN!! MUST BUY.
gta 5 is best
A LIKED THE MODS AND THAT SUUF A  HATE THE BLOOD SO YEAH BYE
Removing vehicles that had been around for around 10 years from the in game stores was a really bad move in my opinion. The only thing else I have to say is that cheaters infest and disrupt lobbies while going unpunished themselves and it is pretty easy to not need to do anything in the online to get money. I mean you can play the game it just sucks a bit more now.
I'm exited to see gta 6
I am wanted in 38 counties for vehicular manslaughter and financial fraud
"I don’t understand why you’d want to drive all mad, hit pedestrians, rob a convenient store, and do it all again if you could just do it in real lif-"
it is quite a fun and exciting game i really like it
why must you punish the mod community? shame.
fire ass story bro
Very Fun and i like to play online
its so funny to play with my big hot brother
good geme
"For the love of all that is holy in the world, do not ****ing buy this game, do not play gta online, ever..."
"i like this game, it gives me so many emotions"
a classic cant wait for gta 6
just got on pc super fun always played on xbox since 2017
still fucking sucks
"story is decent, online multiplayer is a 10 year old cashgrab, almost entirely unapproachable for new players due to the astronomical buy-in cost of any and all money-making opportunities, and thats if you dont get suckered into draining your starter cash on something you might actually want such as a vehicle or fancy/conveniently located apartment home. its a mess of modders and hackers that you will most definitely encounter, though there is an option now for private lobbies, however incomes are diminished so you are actively discouraged from playing with only your friends."
i love this game i feel like its a little short but i say this is the best game in the world right now let your kids play it there is so much learning aboutr the real world in this game
its fucking gta.
YES VERY GOOD WOULD BUY AGAIN
Loved the orgasm them strip club girls gave me OML

Very realistic

Rockstar Support Suck
Rockstar is being hostile to the PC community again... An entire fanbase just getting screwed. Just endorse the modding community that made what you couldn't.  #RIPFiveM

"Play this game friends, if u failed in life start ur new life in this game, quit ur job and go making heist with ur friends, earn money, buy a luxury car, try all gun, be millionaire and buy anything that u can afford in real life. Make a whole city cops find u with helicopter and SWAT, heard the siren, feel the vibe of being Grand Theft Auto V, piece out Yallll."
"great games, waiting for the next one!"
You're reading a review about GTA 5 and didn't play it yet? Are you living under a rock?!  Still great. You're even save from cheaters and griefers in online mode now.
Dont bother with the launcher

This game very sucks
do I need to justify?
this is my first time playing on pc i pay on ps5 and its more fun on pc
I've played for 50 hours done all the story mode endings and just started online. Even though it's been 10 years the game is definitely still worth buying.
Best game I've ever played!!!!
They did Johnny dirty.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL GAME LIKE GORGEAOUS I THINK IT WAS AN GAME FOR WORLD BEST GAME
You know this game is good.  I would appreciate you checking out my series i put alot of work into :) You'll enjoy it! https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDls-Ab3svj1dOQDpNAhHSjfRxioQ5ySp

i play fivem its pretty fun
this game is dog shit
its a good violent game
"This game should be the best game of all time. We should all be on there with IRL friends, new friends we've met around Los Santos, but no. It's all a distraction machine to get people to spend money. This game came out ten years ago and still takes several minutes to boot up, and then several minutes to join any lobby. It is a disaster of performance and a model of greed in its monetization."
it godd

"Ill cut it right to the point. this is a good game, that could be great IF they would moderate the servers ALOT better ( who am i kidding if they even moderate at all ). When you venture onto the live servers , be prepared for many many toxic encounters. You will have to just deal with it at this point it seems, since it appears to be the way Rockstar wants it. Even if you spend real money on great gear... IT JUST WONT MATTER. The modders ""good"" or bad negate everything that could give you a legitimate edge"
"It is fun, I like running over hookers and police men, i would pick up a hooker, do the deed, then shoot her for the money back, woohoo free head"
"Graphics – 8/10 Sound –8/10 Gameplay – 9/10 Story – 8/10 Replayability – 9/10  Overall – Grand Theft Auto V is an insane experience. The mission-to-mission beats are a blast to play through. Each character offers a unique perspective to the city of Los Santos. The heist missions are a ton of fun and the story pacing feels fast and thrilling. The character development is surprisingly well done. There are a ton of missions and side missions to complete, you could easily spend hundreds of hours doing everything. Had a pretty great time with this one . Highly Recommended.    🖥️ System Specs  Intel i9 13900K | NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 FE | DDR5 32GB RAM | Alienware AW3423DWF 3440 x 1440 165Hz"

Have bought GTA5 now for the fourth time 🤡🤡  Rockstar games knows how to rip people off but fuck it GTA5 is a great game even if it is now over 10 years old.
"I love the game, definetley worth it's price. I really love how there are voice lines for almost everything"
its gta why wouldn't you wanna play
cannot be opened
I realy like the game its super fun and it never gets boring
"Online is very fun, for both passive and agressive players"
its pretty good but its not a game that you would play all day i give it a 8/10 pretty fun ngl.
love itt
enjoy this game on online with hotspot wifi
nothin
"I have been playing this game since 2013 release in both PS and Pc. Its a good game of course, but online scene gets boring after some time."
"Booted into a lobby and saw my address in the chat, this game makes me feel safe."
its fun to grind but if you don't want to just mod
Great game when is 6
bad to the bone great game
"Still, infuriatingly, by far the best open-world 'freedom' game available. Los Santos is your oyster! And if you're 10 years late for the story; It's pretty good, too! Still worth a play-through if you somehow haven't yet!"
The freeplay is intense. One of my favourites.
its a good game. not for kids
shit as n166A GAME
Story Mode: Great  Online: Funking utter SHEET! And I just insulted sheet for comparing this game to it. I played for like 2 months and quitted without a second thought. 5 months later I tried it again. and just went back to Story mode after 10 minutes. You don't want to download Online and only wan Story Mode? Sorry but you FUNKING CAN'T! You better off pirating the game instead.  i even have more fun playing Genshin than GTA Online

"Grand Theft Auto is not just a game, Its an Emotion"
"The game is really good it self, and GTA online, I am out their selling whatever I have, the games good, maybe too good, all what you h=need to deal with is players and toxic mods, that's all."
The best game that i even play
mind blowing game in the worldd

RUIN YOUR FRIENDS DAY OR GRIND OR KILL PEOPLE FOR FUN  EITHER WAY  HAVE FUN
Best game so far
bahahaha
Now in 2024 this is still a good game
plok plok 69
its fun in single player but its a 10 year old gamer that should have a successor by now. and the online should not be peer to peer to help cut down on the cheating that ruins online
i am never playing this game again. the assholes at rockstar removed vehicles i had intended to purchase. rockstar is forever at the to of my shit list.
"I really like that theres a store thats specifically for shoes, i find it very interesting"
bad game cant have sex with prostitutes in the tank
bababoi
great game but if you dont atleast have a decent to good pc it will lag alot which means you can not play five m just online and story mode but even those are very laggy.
"After the Cayo Perico heist reward nerf (nerf is putting it lightly, its not worth doing at all anymore), very few things are left to actually make decent money in game anymore. They are trying to force players to buy these Sharkcards (never have, never will). It was cool for a bit but, greed is the downfall of many games these days. RIP =/"
i got sent in to the air the first time i played online
i get to shot people i dislike
It's GTA there isn't much else to say about this game
Shooting prostitutes is fun 10/10
berry fun
"Absolutely unplayable on PC - the cheaters have completely ruined this game.  Stick to console, if you insist on torturing yourself."
Its been the same game for over a decade...and its still fun to play on my 3rd different system

this game is fun in story mode when you change the carachters to random fornite characters don't know how but I got Andrew Tate beating Dark knight from fortnight in a battle the nkim jong un as michael. And Lewbron as Franklin.
this game is very classic and a great game just getting old and repetitive. need gta 6 now
"i love this game, its good when you get fucked over when selling goods :)"
"To be honest, this game doesn't really have anything super fun to do that wont take you like 15 days to get. The start is really rough if you don't have a friend to play it with. But apart from that, I can't take away the funny stuff that has happened and how much I've enjoyed this game overall."
bike make boom boom on cargo :(
I only play this with friends and we just mess around killing each other honestly recommend so fun
I bought this game for 30 dollers and i go to run it and i go to rockstar laucher and it goes through steam and then it just says failure app already running .

nice game to play with friends
It's impossible to play online without encountering cheaters
OK.
"(Im only talking about the offline campaign) I’ve never seen such a great story like this one has!! They put a ton of effort on this game! :) the graphics are also great, and i got only 1-2 really minor bugs, and crashes in every 4-5 hours. May the bought investment buildings could pay more. So its 9/10 for me."
it remembeR  my child hood
Neat game

Bok gibi oyun
Helps with the stress
it's better than from Epic cause I can use my controller. Sorry not sorry
this is the best game even if its 11 years old never getting boared
Best of all time
"Current GTA V is a walking L. Oppressor Mk2 is the sole reason. Lazy content updates and Nerfs to all the fun shit doesn't help, as well as actually removing content that was already there and charging money for it is the worst decision ever. Anyone who's actively giving this game a thumbs up in 2023 is a fucking idiot who supports one of the worst publishers ever."
the game is amazing but only thing is my potato laptop cant handle it but i love the game watched many videos on youtube and this is the first time playing
good gam my is next is gta 4
Definitely Worth purchasing
i lost my acc i sad :(
guns go boom boom
the game is great but unfortunately you cant do much things anymore
"i don't like playing this game, do not buy the game."
I really want to play again this game again because i uninstall it for lack of storage but for some reason i couldnt log in back in the game for this f*k*n SOCIAL CLUB and the password of it is in my broken CP whatever i do to try to create new account they will say THE STEAM ACCOUNT IS ALREADY LINKED TO A DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLUB ACCOUNT. PLEASE LOG IN TO YOUR SOCIAL CLUB ACCOUNT INSTEAD. Those MF in Rockstar want us to DIRECTLY buy again the game again in their ROCKSTAR b*llsh*t site whatever it is. so frustrating if i were you dont uninstall it.
i mainly play story mode great story but online can have alot of hackers
real good game
shoe
oppressor mk 2.
Great game to mess around with friends on.

This is a review after hitting 1k hours.
GOOD AMAZING GAME PLAY THE CARS ARE COOL AND THE the missionS  ARE fantastici am just side machines for the side events are cool to so i hope to see more like this game in  my  recommendation
you can pick up hookers in a hearse
"Rockstar has somehow kept this alive for 50,000 years. GTA VI will have an extremely high standard to live up to. Is mostly fun with friends to do missions or heists. The grind to get money is crazy hard but once you have stuff the game gets kind of boring. Servers are riddled with hackers and Oppressor Mk II's that make anyone who isn't a participant miserable. Occasionally you will come across lobbies where everyone is wholesome and those moments make it so worth it.  Car meets, chases, just messing around having fun with strangers and good vibes. 8/10 overall. Curious for GTA6."
"its kind of hard say no to all of this content, i got this on sale for roughly 35 dollars AUD with the criminal starter pack version.  this is the 3rd time ive purchased gta 5 over several consoles and it never fails to disappoint. most content in game can be purchased through playing the game or you can purchase shark cards to speed things up a little.  honestly, if you want gta 5 go get it. you wont regret it."
"I'm not sure how the reviews on this game are so good. Its a masterpiece, but the online play is awful. Constant disconnections, awful interfaces for every menu, pay to win items. It's basically unplayable with friends with someone always disconnecting."
oh baby oh oh niggers oh the strip club women made my little snake grow grow!
awesome and epic
Having played on each variation of Xbox console since Day one of the game and logging thousand plus hours of playtime. To recently buying the PC version only to discover progress is non transferable and I have to start from scratch again which is annoying enough but to also find I cannot replace my vehicles because Rockstar has seen fit to remove them from the game is the final insult. I will not be buying anymore Rockstar games. As they are now no more than A blatant cash grab
sexy wemen so hat wuld smacsh cuz so cute and spice
itsd a good game. i just cant klog in because my account got hacked
iT IS gOOD
its a great Realistic game and you will find lots of friends
"this is garbage, how old is this game and its having numerous errors w the game launcher, one i cant even uninstall, has so many components required just to launch this mid game. in the year ive owned it ive only been able to get 7 hrs of this pathetic game. rockstars gotta be the laziest and unmotivated greedy scumbag developer in existance. wish i could get a refund on this garbage"
I purchased this game to play with my sons.  Unfortunately it is impossible to play online with more than one computer in the same household.  We each have our own licensed copy but only one of us can connect to an online game with friends.  This issue has been posted all over the internet and the publisher has not done a thing to address it.  Do a google search before wasting your money.  I am not likely to purchase anything associated with Rockstar Games after this.
the best game ever you need play
greatest game ever made
yes fun very
Ride to the highest peak on your bike and ride down without crashing
this game is fun if your really wealthy vehicles
i love killer hookers
erere
cars and humans and guns= 10/10 game
I love it!!
"i got spawn killed by oppressors. I don't know why these nitters use hacks either. Like go outside fr. If you really think you can stand there, behind a screen, and make someone cry, you are fucked up man. Like actually get a life. Seek help. Make some friends.  Suicide Prevention Hotline: 988"

yes stripper sexy
bunch of cheaters/ hackers on GTA Online. Do not by this game
"good game, too many modders"
BS scripthook crash makes this game TRASH
zajebista gra
its good but modders in online ruin the entire online experience
best game cro
"Gta v is probably the best gta game. The world of the game feels alive. The map is big but i still remember every single spot on it. Los antos is well designed. You have differences in each part of the city, like rich neighborhoods or gang occupied ones. The story with its 3 different characters is well written. The gameplay is smooth, shooting is great and driving is fun. Also running around killing people is also fun in this game"
cant access game due to your extra trash for no reason launcher nice i guess my brother play on my steam when it first came out and im stuck ever locked on an account i cant access unable to even  rebuy or anything f___ me i guess nice job Cockstar
fucked 20 women under the bridge
This game is good but i wouldnt recommend it to kids that r under age.
"cow sucklimking dick m,pnkey"
"Updates are smashing.... But small details, Cashing money for chip at the casino.... Freezes and stops.... no esc. no nothing .... Call it an old school crash...."
Haven't fixed the online servers. Don't bother. Just go get your money back
"GTA VI should be out at this time, tbh"
Not Bad
To big for my harddrive never got to play
"Awesome game, awesome, awesome game. But please adjust for GTA6, don't even care if its addressed on this game. The average joe police/gangster/mercenary helicopter gunman are way overpowered in terms of accuracy. A lazer-guided robot wouldn't be that accurate. The player character is supposed to be one of the most talented characters in the game, whilst riding with other players or computers and with aim assist I find it very difficult to hit targets, therefore it should be at least that hard for the average chopper gunman, now I would understand a boss or even several stronger chopper characters, but these every day chopper gunman have curving bullets and x-ray vision, hell they hit you before your can apply armor after re-spawns. cant believe its gone 10 years like this. That is all. Also, I have a great RDR/GTA idea, but I think its worth far too much money to share on here."
never launched always crashed
the most game of all time
my game dont start
Good game i want more guns
"i still havent even started the story mode yet, online is great"
пщщв
made me ejaculate

A game where people that hacks will literally lock you in a cage and take everything you have because you killed someone that was being racist in chat and wore the kkk outfit. Just putting this message here for rockstar to see how fucked their game really is.

Rockstar launcher doesn't work.  Can't play a 10 year old game.

"This game is so outdated, it has so many bugs, the animations are shit, the playerbase is even worse the content is dry and it's filled with modders. Definitely recommended if you want to sit hours in front of your screen and cry about how bad it is to make money, in the online mode that is, but the story mode is actually good and by far the best part are...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................the tits"

This is the best game ong
Super awesome Game
best gamke ever
"its good, 10 years is crazy tho"
unlaunch
Game where you do things like exist and do car things. Hype game but could use more game.
its 2023 I logged in for the first time in years. I walk 3 steps.. and a car teleport in front of me. The driver gets out and hits me with a hatchet then my game was forced crashed to desktop. It used to be a good game but don't waste your time in 2023. God help anyone who finds enjoyment in that.
vrooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooom
200 hrs in the strip club
400 Hours!! Unfortunate that I got to play this game after RDR2 released but still enjoyed to the fullest while 90% of the game was spent pretty much roaming around like a clueless donkey! xD waiting for rockstar to top this with gta6 <3
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
"game sucks, keeps kicking me and my friends outta sessions for no reason but we have decent enough internet to deal with it not"
"To be able to play this game I need to launch to Rockstar launcher app first, and then launch this game. What a hassle. If it wasn't for that then this game would've been perfect. Corporates will always be corporates so yea. Have fun ig."
"A LOT OF BUGS AND CHEATERS, THESE FACTORS RUIN THE IMPRESSION OF THE GAME MAXIMUM. WHEN I TRY TO PASS THE SAME THING 4 TIMES, AT FIRST BECAUSE OF A BUG THE PHOTOS DO NOT COUNT AT ALL, I HAVE TO WAIT A DAY, THEN THE CHEATER TELEPORTS TO THE OTHER END OF THE MAP INTO THE SKY AND ALL AGAIN. I'M REALLY SICK OF THIS. THIS GAME HAS HUGE PROBLEMS WITH BUGS AND CHEATERS, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'M WRITING SUCH A REVIEW. HAVING ALMOST 1000 HOURS OF PLAYING, I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT SOME UPDATES DO NOT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER, THE DEVELOPMENT TEAMS APPEAR TO WORK SEPARATELY. EVERYTHING IS RELEASED ONLY AS WELL AS IT WORKS MORE OR LESS, THEN IT IS DISCOVERED A LOT OF BUGS. CHEATERS CAN DO ANYTHING IN EACH SESSION, GIVE YOU MONEY, PLAY YOU THE INTRODUCTORY FILM OF GTA ONLINE, TELEPORT YOU ANYWHERE, ETC. I WOULD GIVE THE GAME 8/10 BUT BECAUSE OF BUGS AND CHEATERS THE GAME DOESN'T DESERVE HIGHER THAN 4/10"
very good very epic
Incredible gamplay modders will sometimes help you and irrasistable wepons
i granded my theft auto..five times
"Just Got the game a few days back. I never thought i would end up enjoying the game, most especially when playing GTA Online..This Game is the BEST!!!"

Amazing!This game is my childhood. Cant wait for GTA 6. :)
No ending options to play...
pp game
"Grand Theft Auto is most definitely the best way to kill time, I absolutely love the heists and driving systems in this game. You do not need anything big in the game to have some true fun, I strongly suggest this game to anyone who has been debating on getting it. Well worth the amount of money and so so much to do. I love searching for random things as the map has so many things and secret easter eggs too!"
it  is very good aftr all :)
SOLID

"Walked arround the hood, shot a hooker, ran over a fat guy, got home and tried the game out, its pretty cool if you ask me"
I love cars
"Worth playing GTA Online, but it's worth when you play by your own on a private session."
If this is your favorite game of all time chances are that you're on a offender registry.

Very good game but alot of cheaters/exploiters and rockstars not doing anything about it.

You can play for 3 hours unknowingly and it does not get boring quickly unlike other video games.
thi sgame lit
game is too good i like the misions
I promised mom that I would not go to the strip clubs if she bought this for me ;)
wefs
Worthable game especially for money
"A culmination of everything wrong with the lazy, talentless, creatively and morally bankrupt gaming industry we deserve. After all; most buy this trash at least twice per generation."
"My friend told me that he will buy me a pack of chips and a soda if i get 10 awards on a GTA 5 review, so, i will just left this thing here. Help a brother."

"perfect game, prefect story"

ONline just sucks. Fix modded players
Greatest game evr
Rockstar launcher says my steam is linked to another social account and that I can't play without signing into rockstar launcher. This alone deserves a negative review. Can't play a game I paid for because of your shit launcher.

"I've owned this game a long time and now I can't play it. When I bought it my teenage daughter was sharing my account and the game is tied to one of her old rockstar accounts apparently. She's now an adult and not living with us but before she moved out we created her own steam account and I bought her her own copy of this game. Up until now, none of this was a problem. It was just logged in.  But I made this simple mistake of upgrading one of my hard drives. I cloned it to a larger, faster SSD but in the process Windwows gave it a different letter. It suddenly was looking for the launcher/social club on a drive letter that didn't exist and it said I didn't have space to install it. A little googling shows a consensus that this is a know issue and the only way to solve it is to use a 3rd party uninstaller to remove every trace of the old program.   I did that and it let me reinstall it. Finally. But now it wants me to log in with an account that was set up with my daughter close to a decade ago. There's no way around it. I can't log in with a new account, or with my own rockstar account that is tied to other games I own on this same steam account. I would buy another copy just to not have to deal with this BS but I can't do that in Steam with my existing account, and even my daughter isn't able to help me. So do I have to create a new steam account to play this game? Rockstar sucks."

GREAT. I LOVE ROCKSTAR
"IDK how but they keep making it worse, this ""patch"" broke car garages, car physics, and made cops invulernable to all damage for me, how ROCKSTAR managed to fuck this up is beyond me saying this game is almost old enough to fucking drive, they just seem to take any community advice and do the opposite, go find someone else to take your money that makes it seem like they care about their customers"
This game is fun when you have other people to actually play with unlike playing by yourself.
"Everyone on PC should be voting this as a NEGATIVE review or change their reviews to Negative after Rockstar took away about 180 available cars to buy, from us PC users, & to top it off, you need GTA+ paid subscription to buy those cars that were taken away but to make things even worse, Rockstar Games GTA+ paid subscription isn't available on PC, only next-gen. They robbed us. Rockstar Games has lost the plot. What a joke. They have cheated us all."
I buyed the Premium edition with megalodon shark card but when I finished customization with my online character of John wick. I pressed yes for introduction but it skipped it but I didn't get my $10M and $1M from it. So I need and answer here and help.
Sound game
Game doesnt let you to juju on that beat but overall pretty good.  (Give us the cars back rockstar)
itz good if u got moola

bambaclat
game như lồn nhé ae
yes come join the hell that is getting greifed and kicked from most/ all lobbies. oh and even better ive never modded and somehow now i am flagged as one { prob all  the rouge modders flagging ppl honestly } but woopie now i can noe avoid them ever. just got stuffed for a hour and raged off have fun getting shafted alot.   could be great love the missions and cars story and random quarky encounters but that is all eclipsed by the tremendous spam adds ppl spawning in heaps of  trash and just the bad loadtimes and random d/c from server after loading for upwards of 20 min.
good game i like plaing gta online i plaed them 22 hour
A Good Game For All 15+ Age
Been playing GTAV on and off since its release. Great game to kill time ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Is very fun, can fly in sky, or float in boat. Can dress up character, have purple shiny car, buy nice things. Can do mission, can say no thanks. Can play with friends, can get troll, can rick roll."

Flying motorcycles with guns go boom
det er dårligt fordi at trevor har en kasket på
I had a lot of fun driving cars while GTA's radio was on. It has fantastic radio stations. I don't do missions very often. I mostly just enjoy the open-world experience. Awesome game.

"Game incessantly crashes, experiences issues, closer to malware than a game for any computer that has it.  Then accidentally deleted the wrong character once again due to performance issues and can't get it back due to B team programming. God this game sucks."
even though lspdfr and the game didnt work i am fixing it
Let us pray for GTA 6 online :steamsalty:
"amazing graphics. Great servers that are all very diverse in languages, gameplay and other options"
"Purchased and downloaded through the steam store. Started playing on the Rockstar launcher and it repeatedly told me the authorization code was invalid, went through Rockstar customer support (who wouldn't know the palm of their hand if you slapped them silly with it) to no avail and after a 9hour download and 4 hours of moving files and reattempting to log in have come to the realisation this is a fantastic way to give £30-£60 to a company that needs and deserves it less than most hard-working people. Thank you for nothing"

"I think I've played hundreds of hours on PS4/PS5 but still;  as a person who has been playing all GTA series since GTA 1, it was an amazing 10 years of GTA V journey. Thank you dev team <3"
shit game i want to kill myself you should play it
you can VERY easily get hacked on this game
Hacking Everywhere
"Don't like the attitude of the support team! My rockstar account was hacked, for a year and a half I fought to get my account back. was eventually returned. i was able to play online for 3 days when i got blocked for 30 days because a hacker cheated online! Rockstar knew my account was hacked! could have only taken off achievements/money, not penalized me further! No explanation followed, it was simply said that the blocking and the decision are not subject to appeal!"
game very good
"Bought the Steam version of this game after purchasing three Xbox versions and one PC version.  I bought it solely to use with Luke Ross's VR mod and it was pretty cool.  Rock Star were blanks and constantly kept updating stuff to make it not work, which made it less enjoyable.  Then they outright shut down Luke Ross's mod.  I have been playing GTA series since GTA3.  I don't think that I will buy another game from them.  They can thank Luke Ross for the last two games I own (RDR2 also)"
i like tom
just no

"It's been several years but I'm starting this game over.  Somehow my save file was deleted after 115 hours in and I just never picked it back up for years,  Great game, I can't say anything that hasn't already been said."

"all time best video games, thats it. thats my honest rate to this game."
likey
I CANT LAUNCH THE GAMEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gta V is a great game but when you finish all of the missions there is nothing we can do. The online is great. Is really enjoyable. Even after 10 years the graphics are incredible. You should really play this game especially if you like car or plane.
The only thing id watch out for is getting your account stolen by hackers like mine did I cant even recover it.
"Ok saya merubah review saya menjadi positif lagi pada GTA V onlline karena ada 'solo private session' yg membuat saya senang. Tetap harus selalu waspada ketika anda main GTA V online pada 'public session' ! setiap uang yg anda dapat secepat mungkin langsung deposit ke bank sebelum para modder dan cheater merampok anda, dan secepatnya pindah 'session' baru ketika situasi mulai rusuh oleh para modders dan cheaters.  Untuk Rockstar : Tolong rubah aturan 'penggantian nickname' dari setahun sekali menjadi sebulan atau seminggu sekali, agar kami bisa terhindar dari 'Bully' para modder dan cheater yg sudah hapal nickname kami."
nice everything
very good and best game love this game

the online is such a micro-transaction focused hell of unbearable nightmarish proportions it actually ruins any positive review that could be held for the story mode.
"GTA 5 is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends stunning graphics, a compelling storyline, and unparalleled freedom of exploration. The gaming experience is truly unparalleled, providing a sense of boundless freedom in a virtual world full of life. From epic missions to simple activities like car races or just wandering through Los Santos, every moment in GTA 5 delivers unexpected joy. This game is not just a play; it's an adventure worth exploring."
I'm being caged by cheaters in my own house. I would definitely want to be caged again. 10/10
"Buy Planes, Jets, Cars, Boats, Bikes, everything.  I love flying my jet across Los Santos. 10/10"
GTA good game
"Unlikeable/bland characters, boring story, simplistic gameplay (especially when compared with the beautiful and realistic looking world). Very linear heists with almost no real input from the player."
[h1] stop updating this game because we dont care we want gta 6 remove clown award
SO EPIC RUN OVER AND DRIvE SO FAST WOW SO GOOD GRAPHICS AND SMART NPC AND GUN POLICE VROOM BOOM!!!!
"i love robbing banks, cooking acid, growing weed, and blowing up cars  i wonder if GTA will be fun too"
WHERE THE FUCK IS GTA 6
gunz go brrrrrrr
Has a lot of variety
A little violent though
"GTA V : Online is a load of fun, if you have friends that will play in a private session with you. I cannot attest to the public sessions, as I avoid them actively. But, if you don't have friends, you can still solo, it will just take you longer to achieve the same ends. Example: Caya Pericho has a 2.5 hour cooldown solo, and ~45 min cooldown with a partner or group.   With that said, I keep coming back for more, as I am a social gamer.  Highly recommend for other social gamers!"
Fivem is the way to go
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
its fun when you know what to do you should play it
the online multi player is lots of fun and there is lots of new content being added
Best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
too much violins
"Its GTA 5, the greatest!"
Theres not really anything i dislike. Everythings perfect
love the game except for the bad modders
"2000 hours of RP, now I'm mentally ill."
Amazing modding potential. Make the game your own .
"Very violent, DO NOT let children play this video game !!!"
"YES BECAUSE OF VIOLENCE,CRIME,MURDER AND LAST BUT NOT LEST BLOWING UP STUFF"
"they have cars, great fortnite reference"
no mods in servers
very nice to play with friends
"Онлайн режим , максимально стал скучным. Сюжетка в 2023 на ура!  RAGE MP еще десяток лет будет жить в этой игре. 10/10"
keeps freezing omgggggggggggg
GTA V ... also known as Slap Random NPC Simulator
its soooooooooo much fun
i love sniping civilians and then escaping the army in a helicopter
GTA 5 RP is too much fun
weeeeee
I just bought this a couple of days ago and I downloaded mods to it before even playing the game and now it crashes before doing anything!!!! IT SAYS ITS LOADING THEN IT JUST EXITS OUT BY ITSELF!!!
nice chills very good with mods and fiveM
AWESOME SAUCE
Trevor is da mann
"Been out 10 years, definitely put more than 54 hours thats for sure but a great game for the last ten years and would definitely recommend it. Check it out and see how you like it."
fun lots of anger
"Has become pay to cheat in so many levels. Delivery Missions are so repetitive, it gets old really quick. Rockstar decreased rewards from Missions, maybe to incentive Hacks - more likely. There are a lot of bugs, I can't even number them all. But for instance, you spend a lot of money to get a fully upgraded Nightclub, then it just stops working properly and you have to buy another one because that one bugged your products productions. You ask for a vehicle and it spawn miles away for no apparent reason. Something you wont get the rewards after spending 30 minutes of a pointless mission because of Transaction Bug. Enemies will spawn on weird places killing you after you made sure the coast was clear. Enemies wont stop spawning until you follow the script - which most of the time is annoying. If you go into a business, you have a 2% chance of blackscreen. Endless miles on slow trucks delivering stuff that could easily placed on top of a V8 Truck and speed the crap out of the sale, instead of wasting time driving 10mph. Everything is expensive and mission rewards are low. That's why there's so many cheaters, hacks and modders online. Rockstar bans people for cheating at the Casino, but keeps GodMode morons teleporting about ruining Open Activities.  Overall, better downloading a F2P wannabe GTA than paying and paying for cards to be outclassed by any random guy with access to a hacks forum."
"i always get kick if i join to new season and i have to restar 100 time to get online again, and that 100 time is still gacha if i can join then probably after 10 minute play the social club is offline again even my network is working prety good, NO RTO, NO JUMP PING, SINCE THIS GAME DINT HAVE ADMIN CONTROL SO I THINK AM GONNA TOXIC THIS GAME JUST TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE QUIT THIS GAME."
i just want to play gta 5 but i have to make stupid account
It is soooo fun
with mods nice
Play this game with fivem you will get addicte like cocaine
... ..
Good game to play ONLY if you're 18 or 18+
very godddd

"This game commits the unforgivable sin in all of gaming; selling the game on steam but then having a separate launcher. I didn't pay $80 of my hard earned money to jump through more hoops and then get soft locked out of my game because it didn't remember my sign in information. Emails to get my password changed go nowhere, and every action requires a tedious captcha that a robot could very easily fool.  It sucks being locked out of what could be a very good game, through a garbage third party launcher and vague, unhelpful support FAQ's from an enormous, faceless organisation. Least of all when I paid my money for it."

top free roam game
THIS IS A MOST INTERRESTING AND STORY GAME....
my friend Jake Donald Turner recommends this game purely because of the strip club and strippers
the story mode is awesome but the online mode isnt that good
swaggatron game but the players in online suck
pretty good game apart from when people launch 500 planes at me and cashed my game

achei bao
Very good game but the preps for the diamond casino heist are a bit hard
Like... who doesn't know this game.

GTA5 is not a game its life style if you have not played it you just don't like having fun that's just it.

good game ive played it millons of times
Play this game for free vbucks
It's a GTA game. What else is there to say?
NIce Game
FUN AND ONLY FUN!!!!!!!!!
Really fun for all of us
just grinding my hours
car game no violence
The game Is very emersive
"Online has Good Stuff, but getting to the Good Stuff takes a lot of Grinding. Would not recommend for those who only have a few hours to spare in their free time. Avoid public lobbies like a plague, and find friends you can play with."
epic!
LOADS OF GOOD GENUINE CONTENT IF U ARE 12 ME DO ENJOY STEALING CARS AND BANGIN HOOKERS
Ive played for 304 hours its so addicting
smoke weed
i like to hit people with my car
PEOPLE JEST KEEP KILLING YOU
Its fun to play
wompis

Total BS trying to log into this game i'm done!!!

"int his game i can eliminate black people in multiple different ways without going to jail! very fun to play, will recommend"
Steam made my  dream come  it's good for people play PC or laptop most of the time im starting to download mods for my game .
graphics and game play is very nice
"Love when I get rammed by someone from behind, and then he shoots all up my back.  10/10"
i have been playing for about a month and a half and every online game i join is just every player is modding and making everyone who just wants to play the game 1 last time before gta 6 have a horrible time. i cant play the game without being spawn killed or being teleported into the air.
"I don't know we're to far down this games life to know what to say really.   It's awesome to finally have friend only lobbies with no punishment for not being public.  But the game is so full of hackers and so full of bot accounts now that it's hard to say public lobbies are good for anything anyway.   There's the RP world servers and mods I guess. but most of them are run by hypocrites or have long since been abandon by the people who used them,   GTA 4 & 5 have just come and gone the same way , it had its time in the sun , but now its a modders hellscape and you can't 'play' the game anymore.   Also rockstar is a bunch of irredeemable money grubbing A5@H0l#$  who made the game unplayable without hacking in money. prices on everything are to high now. If you don't have a solid 200hours to put into the game you can't afford a business off the regular jobs anymore.    So in short if you're new to the game looking to play the game , save your money."

"The password club rubbish is a chore. If you're like me and not even 0% interested in it or its passwords then avoid buying this game. A steam login is enough. Games great, the wrapper pointless and intrusive to the point where some days I just go play another game. Not as bad as GTA4, but at the end of the day when I press the GTA5 button I want to play the game not mess about with passwords I'm not interested in for a ""service"" that does nothing except get in the way.   Enshitification I think is the term, and r-star is on the cutting edge of it."
Freak this game.
aik hyvä
sucks ass
"""I'm Getting Too Old For This Nonsense."""
Loads of fun. Played lots of hours. Can't wait for GTA6.
Heaven for black ppl

"it's not my fault if I drive into some people, they're in my way. there's also gentle women waiting for me at night. 10/10"
kan kill
"if you want free shit, download C.E instead of buying shark cards"
2k+ hours on ps consoles. Chill ass game. Love going to Vanilla Unicorn and seeing my fav mamas:)
WHEN I PLAY I GET BONER
Best Game EVER
amazing missons and graphics
"Game that has hacker problems, money and rp glitches, filled with griefers, literally freezes half the time when loading up into a new session, but it has cool flying cars, so 10/10"
"Fire game fr fr, fun to screw around for hours in"
very fun always something to do
Bought this game and cant even fucking play anymore because it says steam is linked with another social account. Stupid garbage ass game

"Fun story, always good for a good laugh."
koele geem
Very addictive game and very fun when playing with friends together
its gta watts not to like
screw you boogie
i have lost my car when i bought it in story mode
"GTA V is one of the games that I spent a lot of time learning since the structures are quite complex. Despite, the high price and engulf massive storage, I still bought the game and played with my peers. The game contains absolutely wonderful graphics and details though there are violence and sexual content that are exist. There are several activities to do: task, mission, heist, business, race, etc. Overall, I think it is worthy to buy the game during the discount season."
Cant wait for gta 6
"Single Player Campaign is worth playing for the story, but the world feels a bit empty at times, too bad the focus is more on the online part these days."
Very Nice graphics
Great. Legendary Game!

An end to end experience.  Pick a weird thing to try and most likely it was included.

I am an addict. Every time I think I want to quit playing it draws me back in. I can't stop myself. Help me

"I had fun playing the main story, not just one character story but multiple, side missions are also engaging and fun. Open world is really lively and beautiful scenery.  Gameplay feels slow to me but it is fun"
"""A Rockstar Games Social Club account is required to play Grand Theft Auto V"""
YEAHHHH
IT'S HELLA COOL ESPECIALLY ONLINE PLAY
Because
"each lobby you enter youll get kicked from the lobby, banned from the modders, trapped by the modders, then you get the modded money hungry  people who will just bag and bag and bag for modders to give them money. like shit rockstar just put ALL THE MODDERS IN ONE LOBBY and leave the rest for LIGIT PLAYERS. this game would be good if the MODDERS COULD GO FUCK OFF AND DIE IRL"
"Get FiveM, act like a douchebag cop. Fun times."
ang ganda
Hey
Really a shame they put no effort into single player DLC.

"Introduction: Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is not just a video game; it's an interactive crime saga that continues to captivate players across multiple platforms. Developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, GTA V has become a cultural phenomenon since its initial release in 2013. With a vast open-world setting, compelling characters, and a narrative that weaves together crime, humor, and drama, the game has earned its place as one of the most iconic titles in the gaming industry.  Graphics and Presentation (5/5): GTA V's sprawling landscape of Los Santos and Blaine County is a visual marvel. The attention to detail is staggering, with realistic character models, dynamic weather systems, and a day-night cycle that adds depth to the immersive environment. The game seamlessly transitions between the urban chaos of the city to the serene beauty of the countryside, creating a living, breathing world that feels authentic and alive.  Character Development and Narrative (4.5/5): The heart of GTA V lies in its three protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—each with their own distinct personalities, motivations, and story arcs. The narrative weaves their tales together in a way that keeps players invested in the lives of these morally ambiguous characters. The writing is sharp, and the dialogue is filled with humor and social commentary, creating a narrative that feels both entertaining and thought-provoking.  Gameplay and Open World (5/5): GTA V's open-world design is a testament to Rockstar's mastery of game development. The map is vast and diverse, offering a mix of urban landscapes, suburban neighborhoods, and expansive countryside. The ability to seamlessly switch between the three protagonists adds a unique layer to the gameplay, allowing players to experience different perspectives and playstyles.  The game's missions are varied and offer a mix of action-packed heists, intense shootouts, and entertaining side activities. From high-speed chases to leisurely rounds of golf, the open-world freedom is one of GTA V's greatest strengths. The addition of GTA Online further extends the gameplay, providing a massive multiplayer sandbox for players to explore and engage in criminal enterprises with friends.  Soundtrack and Sound Design (5/5): GTA V boasts a soundtrack that complements the game's atmosphere perfectly. The radio stations feature a diverse range of music genres, providing a dynamic and immersive audio experience. The voice acting is top-notch, with memorable performances that bring the characters to life. The ambient sounds of the city, from the bustling streets to the distant sounds of police sirens, contribute to the game's overall realism.  Conclusion: Grand Theft Auto V stands as a landmark achievement in the gaming industry. Its combination of stunning graphics, engaging narrative, diverse gameplay, and a meticulously crafted open world sets a standard that few games can match. Despite its age, GTA V continues to draw players into its criminal underworld, proving that it's not just a game; it's an enduring masterpiece that transcends generations. Whether you're a newcomer or a returning player, GTA V remains a must-play title that showcases the immense potential of interactive storytelling in gaming.  Rating 10/10"

i have so far spent 206 hours on Mr Rubio's Island
"This game is perfectly balanced for cheaters and temporary account buyers. A 5$ account can permit you to record youTube nonsense about laughing of poor player who don't have billions of GTA cash, and allowed you to feel like a MAN riding your flying motorcycle with invincibility cheat mode, even before you get your first facial hairs for the low low price of messing and discouraging others fair players who only wants to wine down after a tough day at school or work, depending if you live in an occidental country or where the minimum age for legal work is as soon as you can hold the required tool. Years ago that was a great game i had more then my share of that game nearly a thousand hours but since Crooked Star inc. cancelled the dunce’s cap (I supposed) nobody know but there are only cheaters cheating cheaters, and that is a mouth full only saying it so, imagine playing it! The thing i never understood is those games with the most annoying and unnecessary proprietary launcher, are the games with the most cheaters. I guess 7.7 billions is not enough to pay for game admin or research in new anti cheat tech.  Croocked Star: Yes but we have the ban player option and that work perfectly. Players: But it take many days, so our game session is ruined. Imagine a FIFA world event where no soccer ball would keep is inflation on the event day, and the soccer ball companies would answer come back in 2 days our balloon will be ok then, just rent few more night a the hotel and don't worry the air plane companies will be OK with that Pinky swear wink wink!    Lady's and gentlemen come with your hard earn money and get #@&%$*&$%? by the MK2 Oppressor driven by a not hardware banned """" player """" At least the Nascar race are fun!"

"A masterpiece, GTA V. Simply take in the world's size and complexity, the graphics, the dynamics, and the music. As with practically any game, the online component has its ups and downs and may occasionally get rough (if you're new, switch to passive mode right away and find another session when certain kids experience rage issues). However, the amount of thought put into the content more than makes up for this."
Honestly the best game I have ever played. Its been so fun over all these years.
One of the best games made to date.
ดีมาก
Bc its GTA
great game  waiting for GTA 6
"Hello! Im DJ, and I am a proud owner of GTA 5! You need this game, its pretty much cures bordem! my spelling sucks lol, SEE A!"
The last AAA game worth a darn. My only real complaint is the install size.
"Good story, good online mode."
Such a fun game! just careful online theres alot of toxic ppl
Very good game & DLC contents.
"If you are starting on gaming this is the best starter game that you should play. It literally has everything for starters it has Story, multiplayer, grind system, shooting game and etc it has so many stuff in game that starters will and would like. Be careful though it gets really addicting XD"

"I've enjoyed playing this game for years but I forgot to leave a review. I like the vibes of this game at the beginning of its release. But over the years, the lobby in GTA Online started to make me uncomfortable. I'm confused as to whether it's a ""yes"" or ""no"" to recommend this game."

"While we wait ill play again. PS3, PS4, PS5, Xbox 360, Xbox 1, Xbox Series S and now Steam. I've bought this game 7 times in 10 years and i plan to do the same with 6"
Want to remember what it feels like to be on the internet in the late 90s/early 2000s? Welcome to GTAV!  Do you miss waiting 10 minutes praying for something to load only for it to fail at the last minute? Do you miss when gaming was full of rampant cheating and fraud? Do you miss getting pop-ups CONSTANTLY? Well come play GTAV and experience all the joys!

This game made my childhood and is one of the greatest of all times.I recommend anyone to try it out and spend some time in it.It gets more fun the more you progress and it's actually really intresting with the story and the online mode.
too much drive to the other side of the map time wasting
"what is wrong with my game?? i when i first downloaded it and tried to boot the game up it said i had to make a rockstar account (makes sense) so i try to make an account and it said that i ""don't meet the requirements to make a rockstar games account"" what does that even mean?? i'm over 18 so i really don't see why i can't make an account."

this game is straight gas
Great Game lots Of Time Spent on it and its my favourite!. if your buying in 2023 don't buy it and just wait for new release.
"Have not played in a while booted it up and not allowed to continue without a social club account. I got the message ""Time to move on."""
Where is gta 6?
This is my favourite game ever ❣️🌟
"guys, can you believe it?! my IP only got leaked 3 times and i only got DDoS once!"
Why did I move here? I guess it was the weather.
Game needs zero introduction. Greatest game ever made.
gta  online  never gets boring i loved it
trash always updat
it s cool
criminal enterprise starter pack not sport no  longer
"Very fun, I love going the shoe store. Best place in the game"
WHEN GTA VI RELEASE ?
"Grand Theft Auto as of making this review, is almost 10 years old. Sure, this game is 10 years old, but I think it sure as hell still holds up. The community is pretty good, of course there are lots of trolls and modders, but putting that out of the way, you have a really fun game. Story mode is good, but if you want a revolutionary story, go get RDR2, if you just want a fun time, Get GTA, especially on sale. Cannot wait for GTA 6"
eqdaw

"Peice of shit overated game, the better system you have the harder it is to run, someone can have 4gb DRR4 ram and run 4x better then someone with 32gb DRR5 ram, and that aint even exaggeration, it is sooo fucking easy to mod, someone can crash your game if they want for fuck sake, R* just fucking use Easy Anti-Cheat since you cant even spell ""kill ""GTA5.exe"""" in windows/linux/mac command prompt, like the actual fuck??? you guys dont deserve shit  Edit: its still shit XD"
This is GTA 5....I don't need to describe this legendary game.
just baniya things
R8 servers are absolute shit gl trying to do anything without crashing not matter how good your internet or computer is

"won a car at the casino but it must have been in real life since they desperately did not want to give it to me. Basically what happened was, once i won the car, it froze up my game and i couldn't move, thus allowing them to keep the car for themselves instead.   You may now take this buggy mess of a ""Video Game"" forever off of steam and everywhere else, and release GTA6. NOW!"
good for time pass
Jimmy De Santa is my waifu.
Love the game just waiting for 6 now :)

"GTA 5 offers a thrilling mix of gameplay experiences. It's a game that lets players live out their criminal fantasies while also providing a sharp critique of modern society, all set to a soundtrack that captures the essence of Los Angeles. GTA 5 is a genre-defining title that offers an unmatched level of freedom, chaos, and entertainment in the world of gaming."

"this game is awesome. The amount of effort the devs put into this game is surreal. I will say that this game has a lot of violence and swearing, but as long as you are ok with that, it is a great game. I also find it hard to navigate the map and earn money as well as trying to install fiveM and such"
Trevors cool
"best game ever created, 1000+ hours, love it"
Been playing this game since day one only wish i could of brought my game play from my ps3 to pc the grind sucks
"It's an addicting game, but still super buggy. It's even worse if you want to actually play online with other players, as the load times are horrendous, and they get even worse when there is an inevitable modder in the server. If you haven't started playing GTA online, dont bother, unless you want to spend half of your session on your phone during the loading screens.  And don't even get me started on Rockstar's greedy practices. Removing around 200 vehicles that can be bought back easier with GTA plus, nerfing Cayo Perico heist again and again, holding some ten year anniversary items behind a paywall (GTA plus).... that's just what's on the tip of my tongue.   I kinda wish I never started playing, because now I can't stop, which subjects me to hours of frustration when I want to play with other players. I strongly suggest finding another game to get addicted to.  EDIT: I somehow failed to mention that if the load times in public lobbies weren't bad enough, the modders will make things worse. You are GUARANTEED to run into a modder who will do anything they can to ruin your experience, from constantly blowing you up, to destroying your product, and sometimes spawning you elsewhere out of the blue. It's an absolute s h i t show."
This is my best friend br
Lots of hackers in my opinion but the game overall is great.
this game is amazing thank you so much i would like to be police if you could do a update that we can be police tysm
luv this game thanku devs for making such a outstanding game also fuck u zane u stink

"Why did I move here? I guess it was the weather. Or the... Ah I don't know, that thing. That magic. You see it in the movies. I wanted to retire. From what I was doing, you know? From that, that... line of work. Be a good guy for once, a family man. So, I bought a big house. Came here, put my feet up, and thought I be a dad like all the other dads. My kids, would be like the kids on TV. We could play ball and sit in the sun. But well, you know how it is."

Best game.
"Incredibly, astoundingly, amazing, remarkably HORRIBLE online play experience because the utterly rampant cheating.  The single-player (for some reason called ""Story Mode"") is actually pretty fun. But when that's over, since there isn't really a difficulty rating you can adjust, the only thing left is the online multiplayer mode.  Presumably if you have a good group of friends who will NOT be cheating, then this is probably also pretty fun.  Unfortunately, the public online experience is really just a gigantic, systemically empowered griefer utopia.  So yeah, parts of this are very fun, it's certainly visually gorgeous. But replayability and longevity are extremely limited.  Don't fool yourself into ""It can't be that bad!"" because it's utterly, insanely filthy with cheats that have bizarre superpowers and will make you regret wasting the time trying."

"I liked the story in the game, including the online story line. I played this game on the Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S. I bought the PC version because I wanted to experience the GTA Online chaos on PC. The hackers can be troublesome, but they make the game more interesting in how you play it. Yes, this game is old, but it's still a lot of fun."

"Indisputably one of the greatest and most entertaining games of all time. Even with Rockstar's stellar track record of new games, I remain unconvinced that the GTA VI experience will be able to top the iconic status reached by GTA V. Fingers crossed that that's not the case!"

"fuck rockstar services, old rockstar account got hacked, made a new one, won't let me play a game already paid for under steam account, waste of money"
it greate
i was banned for something modders do i dont mod i only play the games for 3 days i bought it and now am ban gta 5 sucks ban the real modders and hackers not innocent people like myself
"Good campaign, mid everything else, rockstar sucks nard bones through straws. how tf do you make a video game unenjoyable for a stoner bro? tf are yall doing in that studio?"
if you play grand rp you don't have life
Takes forever to load and whenever your doing a mission for a buisiness a hacker happens to crashes the server
its fun to run people over

who still needs to read a review for a gta game at this point?
"THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BY FAR THE WORST WORST WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. IT IS COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS THAT I HAVE TO START A TUTORIAL WITH A CRIME FORCED UPON ME. I WAS PLANNING TO PLAY SOLO CHEAT MODE WITH WEMOD INFINITE MONEY SO I CAN BUY FOOD AND JUST WALK AROUND AND EAT AND ENJOY THE CITY VIEW AND GO TO THE PARK OR PLAY WITH ANIMALS OR SOMETHING. BUT I DID NOT KNOW YOU HAD TO START THE GAME BY COMMITTING A CRIME. I LIKE PLAYING GUYS WITH GOOD KARMA AND THIS GAME IS A PIECE OF SH!T. THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE REASONS SO MANY AMERICANS ARE GETTING KILLED. AS AN EDUCATOR, I KNOW THIS GAME IS EVIL ENOUGH TO DRIVE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE TOWARDS LITERAL DAMNATION BY ATTACKING POLICE OFFICERS. WHOEVER MADE THIS GAME IS LITERALLY SATAN OR WORKING FOR SATAN. I HAVE TO SAY I AM VERY ANGRY WITH THIS GAME AND BROTHER YEHOWAH WILL DAMN THIS GAME TO THE GROUND. WHOEVER PLAYS THIS GAME AND MASSACRES POLICE ETC MUST REPENT OF THEIR SINS. I GIVE THIS GAME A MINUS INFINITY. THIS GAME IS CURSED. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT ME WASTING 30 USD BUYING THIS S@@T GAME IS THAT I GET TO POST THIS MESSAGE AND HOPEFULLY SOMEONE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EVIL SICK TWISTED F@@KING GAME THAT PROBABLY INLFUENCED SOMEONE TO DO ACTCS OF GUN VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE. MAY BROTHER YEHOWAH (OR WHATEVER GOD YOU WORSHIP) DAMN THIS GAME."

"Hello, I just wanted to say that I am having this issue similar to many others. and after looking at some of the reviews on the game that I have enjoyed ever since i got it back in like 2017. I am going to tell my story about Rockstar Games. and how they barley do anything regarding people's accounts getting compromised without them knowing. My Rockstar Social Club Account has since got hijacked without me knowing. and I cannot play both GTA IV, GTA V, and RDR 2 anymore due to the Rockstar Social Club Account that is linked to my Steam Account being hijacked. I have since lost the Original Email to the Rockstar Social Club Account and I probably need to buy another copy of GTA V, GTA IV, and RDR 2 somewhere else, so thanks to Rockstar with their unacceptable actions, and barley helping me with anything regarding this issue. I have no way to play the games made by them anymore. I have since lost all of my respect as a company and a corporation. Rockstar has further damaged their reputation as a company to myself, and many others. and I sense that there is gonna probably be a lawsuit about this whole thing soon. and I'll be waiting for some kind of thing that will fix all of this.  Thank you for taking your time to read all of this.  From,  Seth The Incubus"

Leave a positive review on GTA V so I can be on the list of GTA VI beta testers.
"Absolutely amazing, the best GTA game in the franchise so far. It has a great storyline with three distinctive characters. Not to mention the online mode with hundreds if not thousands of hours of fun on top of that. If you have not experienced this, you are doing a disservice to yourself."

One of the best games of all time  Rockstar PLEASE RELEASE GTA6
Because the way the game has changed my life. I feel like i can steal anything. I recommend this if you want to learn how to steal. Buy this for your kids they become successful.

gta 6 wen?
Best Game Ever tbh
"I ONLY recommend this game if you like story and modding, otherwise at this point it's a scam. if you want any gear whatsoever without getting griefed or messed with you'll need at least 150+ dollars to buy the essential survival items for online. this game gets frequent updates which is cool until you realize none of them bring content to story mode and you'll need to buy more currency. developers are also busy with gta 6 meaning if you have any issues with the game your better off going to Reddit for support."

DO NOT BUY ON PC! WAY BETTER OFF ON CONSOLE unless you are a piece of s**t modder who likes to destroy the game for others online. Seriously if you so much as fart around a modder they will crash your game to desktop or worse. GTA 5 online Pc is absolute garbage. i will buy a ps5 to play this rather than use my pc with a 4090 gpu. the game is fantastic without modders online. GTA is my favorite game series ever and i loved gta5 on my ps4 but made a mistake and switched my account to pc.

p gud
realistic and never gets old
i love doing 30 setups then the actual fun heist and repeating this 20 times for a nice car
Played this shit for 17 hours and I've literally only completed the tutorial and 1 mission. Endlessly fun to fuck around in.
wwwwwwwww
so many cheaters in online but the single player will always be good
the story mode is super fun
game does not luanch for me
love it love it love it.
Have and always will be a GTA fan - favourite of all time was San Andreas. This is a game you can launch at any time and have fun no matter how old it may be
meh game
great game everything is too expensive tho
"Игра поможет весело провести  и убить свободное время , и жизнь. Однозначно 5!"
gud gmae
Huge world with - seems like - endless missions to play...
IT WAS GOOOD
GTA Online seems to be more exciting and enjoying than story mode

"ridiculously dumb gameplay in ""online"". repeating the same boring missions a million times (driving around the map for 15 minutes to get 30-40k?? seriously? Especially stupid idea of the makers: working for ""goods"", then having other (mostly cheating) players destroy your delivery car and you lose the hour of time you put in collecting it. Just dumb, sorry."

Ain't nothin but a motherfukkin grind.
The economy is horrible in this game. It is a pay to play game and it has a decent amount of bugs. It is really hard to get started in online for new players. Everything requires you to buy something that costs a lot of money. Every online lobby is full of people that just like harass you the whole time. I definitely do not recommend.
Dud just to many cheters i reported a loot of them and still didn t get banned

Thankfully FiveM exists which is what the majority of PC players play now, however FiveM is mostly full of roleplay servers like GMOD DarkRP which negates any potential fun you could have with it because 13 year old admins on powertrips"

I got it on a discount for 9.99€ and it was so fucking worth it. I love this game. You can enjoy Online mode where they. They completly milked the game like i wish my gf did with me tho. And u realy feel that online mode is without any love and no love to details. But the Story mode👌. The Story mode is always fun to play and is with so much love to details and so much to explore.
This game is dream since I was born

Still the GOAT of games even after all these years. I really enjoy playing this game.
good game and nice grafics
My grades dropped faster than gta 6 leaks after playing this game
"The only thing Rockstar cares about is selling shark cards. they are constantly taking things away to bring them back either time gated, or hidden behind GTA plus. it's nothing more than a money grab at this point. they keep making it worse to try and push people to buy more shark cards and GTA plus. Rockstar is a Hollow shell of it's former self and care for nothing but how much they can take from you. Story, gameplay and fun take a backseat to the money grab. it's just gross."
"This game has story mode (offline, by yourself)  and online mode (you, and your friends, enemies, strangers, griefers, everyone else)  This review is mostly for the online portion of the game. First, it's a great game.  They do weekly updates, so every week new stuff is on sale, different cars, different businesses (usually), and they'll change some of the payouts on different tasks, heists and businesses.  There's daily tasks you can do that respawn every day in different places as well.  It can be a car game, a fighting game, a shooting game, a heist game  The empire building part is what I like,  start a business, and set it up, most of them can make passive money whenever you're online.   Arcade, Agency, Night Club, Drug labs, Bunker, Aircraft Hangar, tons of heists, arena racing, auto shop, bike shop, warehouses, private military stuff, whatever you want. And you can run everything all at once.  Or you can just run around killing strangers for no reason. (you will get killed right back though).  Game has lots of flaws, character mechanics are weird, but it's a 10 year old game. It's alos really frustrating sometimes, either because of some other weird game mechanic, or because some rando on the internet decides to give you grief for no reason (""it's part of the game"").  You can set up private, friend only, or crew only lobbies now, and still do all the missions so I run my nightclub like that, do the daily stuff, and buy the things I want when they go on sale.  I bought this game lots of times on lots of different systems (PS3, PS4, PS5 and lots of PC guys),  PC is the best because you don't need to subscribe to PS-Plus, or X-box Live to play online,  but there are advantages to playing on a ""current gen"" Xbox/PS console (more content). I mostly stick to PC now, though I do play on PS sometimes.  It goes on sale for around $15 all the time, buy it."
Trevor is GTA personified
"only bad thing is R* dont like modding, so every update ruins all the mods :/"
mmmmm
take in the prostitute then kill them afterward money
"u should try is at least once , i have nothing to say more about this game wow"

"As a Noob, Pro, Player of this game until now it's enjoyable to play GTAV"
"R* encourages hackers. I've lost billions, equal to hundreds of dollars rmt. R* won't refund it. The only logical outcomes are to spend literal hundreds of dollars to make up for hundreds of hours of grinding or to mod the game yourself. DO NOT PLAY ON STEAM! You WILL have your account reset by modders. You WILL have your cash stolen. You WILL lose everything. R* will just tell you ""too bad git gud"" and leave you hanging out to dry. Since I'm unwilling to mod I'll just sit in the poor corner"
Game is pretty fun when you're only playing with friends or by yourself. Very much enjoyable when you play like that. Don't join public lobbies. Bunch of hackers that can access your information. Overall fun game.
Children can crash your game. Online unplayable
the game is too good as an open world game but we can`t save cars in story mode by locking the cars except the garages
good work
Can't play without a Rockstar Social Account but when the account gets messed up somehow I can't use a new account without making a new steam account to link. Decently fun game to be stupid with friends on but that only works when the game is playable. Can't even get to offline campaign play as is which is ridiculous.
Sometimes you can force skip loading screens by unplugging and plugging in your controller.
Nice graphics
GRUDD GAME
its a  fantastic game
Yes👍🏼
Great. Where is male strip club? how download sex mod?
I got this game in 2017 only for a hacker to steal it in the next year. When I took the account back in 2021 I had 2.5 billion dollars in the bank and most businesses. Thank you Nordic hacker!
Never heard so many N-words within a span of 10 minutes
"Modders and Hackers have destroyed the PC version of GTA Online. Take Two Interactive is a 30 billion dollar company and they cannot fix the issues with modders. The online component of GTA is completely un-playable and potentially unsafe to play due to modders obtaining IP addresses. If I was the US Government, I would investigate TTI and Rockstar for Privacy Violations. This company needs to be examined under a microscope."
if you want your insides blown out then buy the game or maybe your into that then. PS for online
it lit
"You forget a thousand things every day, make sure this is one of them."
"Online, this game is pure trash. Offline or modded is the way to go. 7/10"
its fun  because you get to shoot black NI-
"GTA V will go down in history as the best game, besides GTA 6"
"54 GB of your SSD/HDD is wasted on the online portion. You can delete the DLC folder which has most of the multiplayer content and still play single player but once there's an update to multiplayer, you're SOL. Steam won't let you launch the game without updating it. So if you don't have enough space to download the update, you can't play the game. Rockstar should just separate the Single Player and Multiplayer as their own download. I don't care for their predatory online BS MP game but I would love to finish the Singleplayer if they just let me save some space on my SSD!"
Neat Game. Many Modders. Some Cool. Some not Cool. Fun with Friends. Many Cars. Many Mods for Cars. Roleplay. I Enjoy.   Must I say more?
"bad game, not worth the time"
i made drugs lmao
Hatdog
a ture rockstar classic

"If you can get over griefers galore, modders that ruin entire lobbies, and constant bugs, the game is actually fantastic. I've spent a few hundred hours in just the online portion of the game and it keeps calling me back, despite the grievances mentioned earlier. 9/10"
Rockstar has broken launcher. Now everyone who has owned game for years is stuck in loop of asking for activation key.
its super fun can do alot of stuff and yeah
Just the best community game going.
dumb!!!
I Can kill 10/10

Everything. Can't wait for GTA 6!
"if you're going to play online i highly recommend you keep to invite only sessions an use discord or something to find people to play with as the public lobbies are littered with modders making it impossible to get anything done, other than that gta v is the bets game hands down."

story is really nice. online is fun when for a while until you run out of content/things to buy and its horrible when a modder ruins your whole game and crashes u...
the only game i have 400+ hours on  its great but it will suck 15 straight days from you or 2 months of playing
Best game ever And don't forget to download mod minu<3 enjoy :D
"That's a beautiful game and I enjoy the graphics, but I prefer the 4 on almost every other point.  Writing is very weak. Characters complaining about the mission they do for almost no reward is not how to create engaging gameplay. One character has the scenarium personnality. He is unpreadictible in a way that is the main way for the scenario to advance from his introduction in the game. But sure, driving aimlessly in a beautyffuly recreated pocket southern California is very fun."
WE LOVE WE LIVE WE LIE
Thats such a slay moment
its fun to play with friends and story mode is good
"I would not recommend this. Although this game gave me weeks or even months of joy And I paid for it. The ""update"" to another launcher is not worth it. I recommend you guys get a pi-rated copy off of 1337x dot to. And don't bother with this. Seriously. I would if I could."
Runs well.
should play story not online or jhonny sins will curse you btw i am messaging on 69.9 hours because there are to nines two gurls
"if you are stilll reading this game's reviews, you are probably to broke to buy it or your PC is dog water"
It s good game
اللالاتلاغافالباتلبات
online gaming rocks
The online version is quite possibly the worst game ever made
"ai moderation  go watch YouTube subtitles and tell me how good they are, and we expect rock star to do better?   single player was ok, multiplayer was ALWAYS a hellscape of hackers, and rockstar did fucking nothing to fix it, but they sure as hell go after anyone who hacks some cash into the game, or now says naughty words... in an m rated game... who japanese vtubers made famous for fun reasons."
"good game, very fun to de-wind after a long day of study or being exploited by your employers"
new player get after completing all mission
"After 8 years Rockstar finally broke their game  Removed most of the cars to drip feed them later at random to make them rare, nerfed most of the mission payouts, increased the cost of any popular vehicles.  All to try to force more people to sign up to their GTA+ monthly payments.  If this is the future then GTA 6 will be balls"
"Apparently at some point after my purchase Rockstar decided you needed to use their launcher and provide an email address, which I never did, so they did it for me.  Now that I've replaced my hardware Rockstar refuses to validate my copy because I don't know what that made-up email is. It doesn't matter that I have the SteamKey, CD-Key, and purchase date. It doesn't matter that they made it up and it clearly ends with ""@123.com"".  They taken my money and they're perfectly content with that. I warn anyone else against purchasing any Rockstar game in the future, lest they decide you aren't you anymore, because of something they did."
very nyc game
시민 멍청한 병신새끼들아 내 앞길좀 막지마라
yeah its good i mean no shit considering its been around for a while and alot of people have it!
its good when you actually have money
"This game sucks! I tryied to buy it to play, i had it in the past through the family share and because of a Steam and Rockstar games bug my account remained linked to my brother rockstar games account. Steam and Rockstar does not care about my problem either, they preffered to refund my money instead of fixing their stupid bug. I cannot recommend this game because they dont care about your money. I cannot either transfer it to another steam account via gift cards or buying the game for another account. Steam and rockstar games sucks!"

Even after a decade game is still amazing! Both Story mode and Online!
Can't wait for the next gen remake remaster redux
"i only play gta online: there are to many hackers, its like an pest. and rockstard dont give a shit either.... the lobby's needs 2-4 players for the heists, witch is fine until the some one leaves a prep or in the heist, and everyone get boted, and you have to manually drive back (most of the time) to restart the heist again, and again, and again. but if you can find proper people that know what to do and stays and dont leave you right befour the end check. well then you might kicked buy a hacker at the end of the heist, oh and not to forget to get agent or prisoner to actually move and follow you, cause agent ulp mission, that is 70/30 chance he moves or not. the loading screen is allso a lucky wheel to spin. either it works fine, or you have a black screen for 2 min, or you have to restart the game. however i find alot of aspects of the game interessting, but the game gets old fast, doing the same heist over and over again will get old, and with people leaving the game etch, + the hackers it gets even more Old faster. id even say that you could try wow befour this game anestly, but if you decide to try. well, the best of luck to you"

"The story mode is good, it gives you a lot to do throughout the map while increasing the difficulty as you accomplish milestones. The online game offers a similar experience but with the ability to do so with friends which makes it harder to make progress alone but it is doable."
"A Video Game That's Like a Blockbuster Movie, Only Better."
Ever since i was 12 i loved gta online but over the years the content gets worse and worse. removing more than giving always nerfing cayo and promoting sharkcards. disgusting.
Very fun. Took me a long time to finish it.
crahes like crazy
i love deepwoekn
Rockstar rlly gotta do sumthing abt the modders
"It really depends, the story is amazing, but when you finish it, i think single player gets boring, and gta online is boring nowadays too. so i'd just get it for the story. let's see how things will turn out with gta VI, which is *supposed* to come at the end of 2024."
"A Rockstar Great Game But Story Mode Is The Best Experience That I Had And Online...Well Online Is A Meh Not Great Enough Because We Players Need More Big Maps Like Las Venturas, San Fierro And Countryside From The Always Beloved Classic GTA San Andreas"
very good game gta i like Gta
Very good game. Recommended

This can be the most entertaining game and most life regretting game to ever exist. This is my most played game by far and I have no idea how I accumulated these hours so fast. Just before typing this review I took 4 different painkillers irl to stay up past 2am to complete the stupid cayo berico heist with two of my hilariously retarded and autistic friends. I recommend playing this game with drugs and being sleep deprived if possible.
Amazing game Love it

"Positive Comment:  Grand Theft Auto V on PC is an absolute masterpiece when it comes to gaming. The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking; the level of detail in Los Santos and Blaine County is simply mind-blowing. From the bustling city streets to the serene countryside, every inch of this virtual world is a visual treat.  The gameplay is equally exceptional, offering a seamless blend of action, driving, and exploration. The controls are smooth and responsive, ensuring an immersive experience whether you're cruising in a luxury car or engaging in high-octane shootouts.  But what truly sets GTA V apart is its gripping story mode. The characters are well-developed, and the narrative is both thrilling and thought-provoking. The game's multiple protagonists add depth and variety to the storytelling, making it an unforgettable journey through the criminal underbelly of Los Santos.  Moreover, the online mode provides endless hours of fun. The variety of activities, from heists to races to free-roam shenanigans, keeps players engaged for years. The regular updates and new content additions by Rockstar Games ensure that the online world of GTA V remains fresh and exciting.  Negative Comment:  However, there's one glaring issue that continues to plague GTA V on PC, and that's the rampant presence of modders in the online community. While modding can enhance the single-player experience and lead to some creative and fun gameplay additions, it's become a double-edged sword in the online realm.  The presence of malicious modders who disrupt the game, spawn impossible-to-defeat enemies, or harass honest players is a significant drawback. It creates a hostile environment that can make online play frustrating and unpleasant for many players. The lack of effective anti-cheat measures has allowed this problem to persist, and it's disheartening to see that Rockstar hasn't addressed it adequately.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V on PC is an incredible game that excels in graphics, gameplay, and story mode. However, the persistent issue with modders in the online community casts a shadow over an otherwise fantastic gaming experience, making it challenging for honest players to enjoy the game to its fullest. Rockstar Games should take stronger measures to curb this problem and ensure a more enjoyable online experience for all players."
the game has been such a good experience and i do recommend it to others.

"Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is a true masterpiece of gaming, an extraordinary experience that sets the bar high for open-world action-adventure games. Developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, this title has earned its place in the annals of gaming history for its remarkable storytelling, vast and immersive world, and an unparalleled level of detail.  A Thrilling Tale of Crime and Intrigue: At the heart of GTA V is its engrossing narrative. The game effortlessly weaves together the stories of three complex protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber trying to escape his past; Franklin, a street-smart hustler looking for a way out of the gang life; and Trevor, a volatile and unhinged ex-military pilot. Their paths intersect in a gripping tale of crime, ambition, and betrayal that keeps players hooked from start to finish.  A Living, Breathing World: Los Santos, the fictional recreation of Los Angeles in GTA V, is a marvel in itself. It's a sprawling, dynamic city filled with bustling streets, diverse neighborhoods, and an array of activities. The attention to detail is astonishing, from the realistic traffic patterns to the vibrant ecosystems found in the countryside. The world feels alive, with pedestrians going about their business, radio stations playing music and talk shows, and a day-night cycle that adds to the immersion.  Endless Activities and Diversions: GTA V offers an abundance of activities beyond the main storyline. Whether you want to explore the underwater depths, embark on a hunting expedition in the wilderness, or engage in a thrilling race, there's always something to do. The variety of side missions, challenges, and hobbies ensure that boredom is a concept that doesn't exist in this open-world gem.  Unparalleled Attention to Detail: Rockstar's dedication to detail is evident in every nook and cranny of the game. The characters' facial expressions, the meticulously designed vehicles, the witty in-game radio commentary, and the intricate interiors of buildings all contribute to an unparalleled level of immersion. It's a testament to the developer's commitment to creating a world that feels authentic and lived-in.  Online Multiplayer: Grand Theft Auto Online adds a whole new dimension to the GTA V experience. It allows players to explore Los Santos with friends, engage in heists, participate in races, and create their own criminal empires. The constantly evolving online world ensures that there's always something fresh to experience, fostering a sense of community and camaraderie among players.  Continued Support and Updates: Rockstar's commitment to GTA V doesn't end with its initial release. The game has received numerous updates, expansions, and content drops, ensuring that it remains relevant and exciting years after its launch. This ongoing support speaks to the developer's dedication to the GTA V community.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a tour de force in the world of gaming, a title that effortlessly combines a gripping narrative, a living, breathing open world, and an abundance of activities to create an experience like no other. Its attention to detail, commitment to storytelling, and ongoing support make it an enduring classic that will continue to captivate players for years to come.

one of the greatest titles ever produced by rockstar
VERY GOODDDDDDD

pow

it great
soon as i got the game i went to the strip club got a dance then went to go beat some woman then got shot up by some cops  ( I WAS BLACK)  (IRL) then i got up found nick eh 30 under my desk doing drugs
"i no longer have access to the email associated with the social club account for this game, cannot create a new account and cannot log into this game. how the FUCK am i supposed to play?!??!?!"
The GTA 5 community is absolutely disgusting.. Children should not be playing this game. They should be in church on a Sunday not gang banging on GTA 5.
Campaign wasnt for me but the online is really fun
fun but still waiting for gta 6
"This game is excellent.   Unfortunately Rockstar loves forcing you to to launch their launcher through Steam so you can launch the game from there, as opposed to just launching the game straight from Steam in the first place. Not only that, but on launch you are fucking FORCED to link your Steam account to Rockstar's shitty Social Club service. Instead of buying this game on Steam, I would propose that you obtain the game secondhand or pirate it.   Rockstar doesn't deserve your money."
"crazy fun, i love driving the cars"
Fun I guess
the game is cool and can do whatever you want and no bugs
"""Gourmet Grand Theft Auto 5: A Recipe for Mayhem""  Introduction: Turn the virtual world of ""Grand Theft Auto 5"" into a culinary adventure with this tongue-in-cheek recipe. While you can't actually cook in the game, let's concoct a metaphorical dish that embodies the essence of GTA 5's chaos and action. Warning: No actual cooking required!  Ingredients:  A Sprinkle of Recklessness  Start by adding a dash of recklessness to the mix. This represents the daring stunts and wild driving that GTA 5 is known for. A Pinch of Crime Drama  Stir in a pinch of crime drama, reflecting the game's intricate storyline filled with heists and criminal activities. A Dollop of Chaos  Add a dollop of chaos to the mix. This symbolizes the mayhem and destruction that players can unleash upon the virtual world. A Splash of Wit and Satire  Incorporate a splash of wit and satire, as GTA 5 is known for its humorous take on social and political issues. A Garnish of Immersive Open World  Sprinkle the dish with a garnish of an immersive open world, highlighting the vast and detailed landscape of Los Santos. Instructions:  In a metaphorical gaming pot, combine the recklessness, crime drama, chaos, and satire.  Stir vigorously, simulating the action-packed gameplay of GTA 5.  Let the mixture simmer while exploring the expansive open world, savoring the sights and sounds.  Continue to stir occasionally, keeping the chaos and unpredictability at the forefront.  Serve hot, in the form of an unforgettable gaming experience, and enjoy the metaphorical flavor of ""Gourmet Grand Theft Auto 5.""  Note: Eat responsibly."
really fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :)
"Game full of griefers, modders, and other racism and scam. Still a great game."
grind
fun makes me bust
bad gaem rockstar couldn't fix a bug if it bit the them bit the bug in ass?
singleplayer was fun when it released almost 10 years ago. can't believe they've milked so much money out of little kids by turning it into a live service game.

Hi I mean good game just adjust setting for good gameplay
poopy
"shoot woman, cops. Shoot cops, more cops."
steal cars shoot people
Half perfection half garbage  Plays lot like San Andreas but it's more polished and its silly but funny story follows wanna-be-retired bank robber who runs into CJ 2.0 and his screw ups bring back upon him Shaw ...I mean Trevor the even more insane redneck hunter and cause of most hillarious and disturbing moments. CAUTION: Game requires crappy launcher and linking it with Steam beside regular annoying EULA then it has old flaws like cars suddenly switching lanes or disapearing out of existence right behind you also F Amanda's red car which game forces upon you
i kill a hooker 10/10
Rock star has the worst customer support

"Grand Theft Auto V with its endless missions is a true epic game. It's like an interactive movie story with an infinite number of plot twists and possibilities. The missions in the game are so diverse that you'll never get bored. The game gives you the freedom to choose how to approach the missions, and this boundless variety ensures incredibly engaging and dynamic gameplay that's hard to put down. Grand Theft Auto V is a gaming masterpiece with limitless entertainment."

SOO BEST GAME AND BEST GAME I EVER  PLAYED ALL PEOPLE WANA TRY THIS GAME
Everytime I play this game I want to kill myself because I realize that I don't have any freedom >:(
Cuz is good
Play and kill cops in the game
"I got this game when I was 13 and completely no-lifed it through my teenage years.  I think it's a great game with an under-appreciated story, a great soundtrack, and a shit-ton of replayabillity. It plays smooth as silk.  GTA Online is great, but not without huge flaws. A majority of my time played was in GTA online. It's a great sandbox with a lot of worth-while content to play, especially with friends. But holy hell, it lost its soul over the years. There's a lot of tedium, a lot of paywalls, and little to no balancing in the PvP or in-game economy, not to mention the modding problem on PC. There's still a lot to enjoy, but your experience may vary depending on what you value, and your patience."
Buy it for the Single Player.  Do not touch the Multiplayer.  I would give it a thumbs up BUT modders can kill you even if you mind your own business in Single Player.  I HATE Rockstar for how easily they let modding scum run rampant. GTA 6 wont be different form this.
"If you're getting GTA 5 for the love of god, get it for the story mode, enjoy that and then ignore online unless you're playing via something like FiveM. Base GTA Online is one of the worst experiences that forces you to either pay or grind for hours to get one car that looks kinda cool. Developers upping the Cayo Perico heist cooldown when done solo really did online in for me, personally. Raising cooldowns on solo, efficient grinding methods while showing ads for the micro transactions in the hour long loading screen is a complete joke. I have more fun in Red Dead Online and Rockstar does not care about RDO at all.   GTA Online is infected with so many levels of irony poisoning that Rockstar isn't even sure if they're parodying themselves or not anymore.  Besides that, fantastic story mode with admittedly repetitive gameplay in most missions. Heists, Three's Company and the missions like those are a nice break from the formula of ""Drive here, kill a bunch of guys, drive again, kill again, done."" that the series has faced criticism for. The real focal point is the story but I'm sure you knew that already.  Story mode 9/10  GTA Online 2/10"
I love this game so much!!
"D0GSHIT FUVCKING GAME LAUNCHER, CANT EVEN LAUNCH THE GAME, STUPID FUVCKING COMPANY"

"The pacing drives me nuts. Walking is too slow, driving is too fast, cutscenes hang for minutes longer than they need to. It's like the developers were on quaaludes when they were working with the physics."
great for the whole family

"Online is full of modders who'll ruin your session and can even get you perma-banned  Go invite only or maybe look at FiveM or other mods to stave off unlettered modders hellbent on ruining your session form their mothers rat-infested basement  EDIT  Ever since r* added security patch, playing online in default lobbies is fun - i got wrecked more in rdo from modders more than i did in GTAO recently - it should be the other way around"
one of the best stories ive ever played super fun
"much blood . Stole car and money ,guns and white weapons and i love it."
Definitely...... One of the best games of all time...... I mostly play online.....
story mode is better than online

"i hate this game, but i still beat it too the gta strippers"
Very fun 10/10
YYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
it is a very good game.i reccomend 24g of ram tho
Never Miss This Masterpiece   Just Go For It
"Fun game lots to do, online and story mode. The story is fun and all but I love playing online however whenever you try to do an online mission/heist you get people that AFK, leave halfway through or no one joins at all. Not really a Rockstar problem but it is annoying. Other than that I highly recommend this game to everyone, I also recommend checking out the other games like vice city, San Andreas, gta 3, and 4. People coming from any of those games will love this game."
realy fun with mods
"As long as I love GTA5, the game has changed the direction where it was. All we have now is a greedy game that wants us to spend more money on. The Cayo Perico's profit is shrunk down significantly. from earning a 1.5mil to bare 1mil is UNACCEPTTABLE! The game is already greedy enough to us spend more money to buy cars, planes etc, now they shrunk down the profit for some reason? I don't get it."
THIS GAME HAS EVERYTHING
itz gud
childhood game
"hey man, i accidentally deleted my main account which had contained the redeem code with it, now i don't know how to get it back, help please!"

I bought this game because my friends told me to.. I don't think this game is interesting at first because I'm not good at this kind of game. But turns out I play this game all day after :)
cheaters everywhere
nerfed payo mission but still doesn't fix the glitch where a guard saw through basement ground and wall. GREAT ROCKSTAR GREAT LOVE THIS 10 YEARS OF GTA
Every gamer should try playing this game once in lifetime

"I love being smashed in the face by Oppressor MkIIs and hearing them earrape the mic, would recommend !"
R* has put the final nail in the coffin with the cayo perico nerf.
like the game
boom boom
good game better with mods
They Blowded up Kokatska no caya parco :(
violence
"the online mode for this game is probably the worst multiplayer game of all time, not because its just sheer awfulness but because theres enough good stuff there to make you think ""maybe this could be good under a specific set of circumstances"" you keep chasing but said circumstances never come. one of the worst gaming communities ive ever had the displeasure of playing with, and still a buggy mess ten years later despite belonging to a company worth 22 billion dollars that cant even stop modders from ruining their shitty game. and i still fucking play it dont touch the online mode dont look at any content for it just play the story mode"
Legendary game
You have to try it to see for yourself!!!
wow. UN JOC!
Loved the single player much more than the online.
"fun when modding but other than that its still great but eh, i mean its been ten years what do you expect"
The Vanilla Unicorn is not an ice cream shop
"Even 8 years later, this game is easily one of the best that you can buy.  Whilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I don't like - and wouldn't really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage - I can't ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities - there's something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make them money whilst they're at it.  Single Player is also undeniably a brilliant experience. Even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story, there's really no excuse for not playing it through at least once.  A lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since it's original release, but from an objective point of view, even if this game released for the very first time this year, it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away.  The driving is much easier than GTA 4, literally anyone can be a decent driver in GTA 5 unless you have brain damage, but I guess it makes it more accessible, lol. Shooting is also much improved and is high quality, and those two elements combined with many others, including but not limited to the excellent map, make this game a perfect sandbox"
no male strippers
Im rich and i have cool cars

I love gta v
i have a penthouse and fancy cars  this greatly appeases me
lots of money
"First off the game is great, in fact it's amazing. Everyone knows that.    I can't recommend this game though because of the awful Social Club and equally awful Rockstar Games Services DRM B.S. you have to deal with.    Played this game fine a few years ago.  I go back to play it and it turns out the email I used to set up Social Club is one I no longer have access to.  Therefore I can't login and can't play the game. Period.   I've been in contact with Rockstar support for a week and still haven't resolved the issue.  I've gone back and forth with them five or six times and every time they want some other proof I bought the damn game. I've sent them four or five screenshots of receipts, Steam ID bla bla bla and it's never enough.  It's ridiculous.  Now even though I have a current Social Club account with an email I can actually access they need a THIRD email to use to ""update my account""?  WTF?  Forget it I'm sick of it.  I even bought a physical copy off of Ebay to try and get around this issue.  No go, Physical copy makes no difference.  Unless I continue to jump through their hoops I will never be able to play GTAV again on PC.  Seriously you guys made tons of money off this game what's the deal with the draconian DRM?  I'm old enough to remember when you bought a game on PC it came in a nice box with a nice manual and maybe even some bonus items with an actual CD or (GASP) floppy disk that contained the entire game and it was yours to keep and play forever.  Now for your money you get a digital copy that's DRM protected to a ridiculous degree that you can't play if you want to try and change something as simple as your email.  Crap like this is why gaming just isn't as fun as it used to be.  Those days are gone, greed has completely taken over the industry when it comes to AAA games such as this.  Loved the GTA series up until this point but this is so stupid guys, I'm out on GTA6 not that it makes any damn difference."
this thing is way too good
"I've been playing GTA V since it's initial release on the Xbox 360 back in 2013. Obviously it wasn't a consistent play time, it was off and on. Today, I received an email stating my account has been suspended for 30 days an my character reset. I figured it was a bad attempt at a phishing email, so I brushed it off. As the day progressed, I thought about that email more and more, and gave in. I loaded up GTA and got into story without any issues(as it should), then proceeded to try to join online. Right then, it hit me. Suspended for 30 days and character reset.  Since cheating had come to online play, I have exclusively played in invite only sessions to avoid the chance of running into someone who would throw money at me. Did this make the game slightly more difficult? Yes, but was worth not having to worry about cheaters.  I went to open a ticket to just try to find out what would justify the suspension/reset, but I am unable to even do that since you can't dispute the issue. GTA, you were once a game that I loved and enjoyed playing, but this is the end for me. I'll patiently wait for GTA VI to release. It was a good run."
Great Game (0ne of the best)We Are so Really for GTA 6....
"such a good game i never seen in my life , high graphics superb missions and open world game"
Its gta 5
"good games, difficult friends. w game. wheres the grand sixth auto theft"
love this game since  i was a little kid.
i get called the N word in every server i join
violence and sex yes
Definetely a Game
"I mean if you get through all the greifers and the bad moders, I'd say its pretty good and thier are also good moders that can give you free money!"
best game ever created. especially with mods
I am now bankrupt after spending 873649$ in sharkcards. 10/10
"Probably the worst game to ever come out, single-handedly ruined the gaming industry."
"Rockstar account has been hacked twice, costing me multiple games each time. I cannot even play my games offline, although they have single player modes. Garbage 3rd party launchers need to end. I would go as far as to say that rockstars launcher is the worst of them all. Even though this is one of my favorite games, their launcher is wildly unsafe and unsecure. I received no notification of any kind that my email had been changed. Since the account associated with my steam account is tied to the one rockstar account, it seems I am stuck without the games I have purchased."
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
real life simulator
I like the part where theirs cars
"The single player is very good, and was a lot of fun. Online was fun but they keep making it worse. The Cayo heist was the best for solo players, so what does rockstar do? Quadruple the setup costs, and reduce the payout by about 33%. Now instead of having a way to make a solid 1 mil, you're only able to get about half that. Thank you rockstar, please just let 5 die and focus on 6."

big sexy woman in shoe store
you either die a hero (stop playing this goofy game) or live long enough to see ur self become a villian (install a mod menu)
this is an amazing game I think that people should try it out of I could rate it out I would rate it 5 out of 5.
If you see random people on the street 'posing' shoot them for your safety they can crash ur game
its a great game but i would say u need a high end pc for like mods and fivem ectra but other than that its a great game
"very addicting, good story-line, and tons to do"

The graphics an speed is just as if your playing on a system.
"rockstar instead of making GTA 6: ""lets nerf 5s heists and remove cars so we can force our players to buy our premium subscription"" -dogshit company that doesn't deserve your money"
This game does not have enough achievements. I didnt even play 9000 hours yet.
"The single player is fine, but the multiplayer is literally worthless unless you have friends to play with or the patience of a saint. You'd have more fun working overtime, honestly."
Even tho it was hard to self teach myself how to work the pc gta5 I love it
good game very sex game

One of the best games ever to be created and played in the history of gaming
This Game Is Really Crack
"Welcome to Los Santos, the city where every traffic jam is an opportunity and every pedestrian is a potential punchline. ""Grand Theft Auto V"" is not just a game; it's a chaotic carnival of crime where the rules are made to be broken, and the laughs come faster than you can steal a sports car.  Let's talk about the main characters: Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. These guys are like the Three Stooges of the criminal underworld, with a little less slapstick and a lot more firepower. Michael's midlife crisis is a comedy goldmine, Trevor is a walking, talking wrecking ball of insanity, and Franklin is the guy trying to keep it all together while wondering how he ended up in this circus.  Now, the city itself is your playground, and the possibilities are endless. You can rob a bank, fly a plane, drive a tank, or just play a round of golf with the same enthusiasm and incompetence as a toddler in a candy store. And if you're feeling particularly artistic, you can create your own chaos masterpiece, starring you as the criminal Picasso of Los Santos.  The radio stations are pure gold, with DJs and talk show hosts that are funnier than most stand-up comedians. You'll find yourself driving aimlessly, just to hear the next ridiculous radio skit or catchy tune. And don't even get me started on the in-game internet. It's like a parody of the real thing, complete with hilarious ads and social media that makes you question the sanity of the virtual world.  But it's not all fun and games in Los Santos. The police are like an overzealous neighborhood watch on steroids. One minor fender bender, and suddenly you've got a 5-star wanted level, and half the city's police force chasing you down. It's like the world's worst game of tag, and you're ""it"" for life.  And let's not forget the pedestrians. They're like a walking, talking sitcom cast. They'll insult you, make inappropriate comments, and sometimes even try to fight you. It's like being in a never-ending episode of a reality TV show where everyone's competing for the title of ""Most Outrageous Citizen of Los Santos.""  In conclusion, ""GTA 5"" is a wild, open-world sandbox where crime and comedy collide in a spectacularly entertaining fashion. It's a game that lets you live out your wildest criminal fantasies while laughing at the sheer absurdity of it all. So, grab your controller, steal a car, and get ready for a rollercoaster ride through the hilarious and chaotic world of ""Grand Theft Auto V""!"

"The online is pretty good aside from the modder problem and rockstar's greed problem, but the story mode is kinda mediocre, especially compared to GTA 4's."
Very much yes
gang
bad game totally give me money rockstar now!!
Just posting this review so it will stop asking me if i would recommend this game to my friends. If my friends or anyone else hasn't played GTAV Online before they shouldn't start now. If you're still playing... Pro tip: Do Not Run Discord while the game is playing! Saves you from long ass loads and dickmove disconnects. peace.
this game makes me feel like the taxi in cars 2
the came is to crazyy
i grew up with this game i love everything about it stoked for gta 6
fun 2 play
Can you believe this game is 10+ years!?!! Wow time flys!! This is the most addictive game! Can't wait till GTA 6.

gta is my fav game
Honestly overhyped in my opinion. Plenty of other games that are much better at base stage (however the rp mods for gta are very in depth and detailed)
Fun and addicting
Always love GTA
"I play modded sp, pretty fun, like forza"
This game is dirty and it makes me feel dirty. Ik that sounds weird as fuck but idk how else to describe it.
fun game great graphics
The story mode is good.  Online is bad.  Better use FiveM If you want to interact with others
need hacker free lobbies too many hackers
"very good game if you have friends also good to play alone, story line is amazing and its just such a great game"
Super fun. Worth the money.
GOOOOOD GAME
WWWWWWW GAME
shit game on pc
This game is a fun but grinding game i think it is great for people to play!
"Продолжим нашу экзикуцию Я ставлю игре средний бал еслиб стим позволял поставил бы и визуально Начнем с минусов, в сравнении с прошлой игрой серии гта 4 многое поменялось, поехали. Зачем нам рпг за пазухой в которой соседствует ещё 3 волыны карабины и 3 пулемета и попутно 9 пистолетов? хрен его знает. Физика машин, о да в гта 4 было приятно мять машины но машины просто могли взорватся и все, в гта 5 немного порадовало что можно пробить бензобак или начнет капать масло и движок заглохнет, но как можно было так ухудшить управление машин и повреждения?! Карта игры, в гта 4 явно видны черты треугольника из гта 3 к примеру аэропорт хоть и переехал немного но все же +- города похожи с той разницей что в игре прошло 7 лет от гта 3 до гта 4 но тоже странно но ладно. Гта са события идут в 1992 году в гта 5 2013, 21 год разницы событий у игры как за 21 год у Лос Сантоса появилось +- 10 высоток в центре города, город стал как лабиринт выросла огромная хер знает откуда загорадная местность которая даже в Гта Сан не было и самое главное куда пропали соседние города Сан-Фиерро и Лас-Вентурас?! Онлайн режим это вообще что-то с чем-то как можно было сделать так что 90% игроков в МУЛЬТИПЛЕЕРНОЙ ИГРЕ РАЗБЕГАЮТСЯ ПО ОДНОМУ В ЗАКРЫТЫЕ СЕССИИ В МУЛЬТИПЛЕЕРЕ, а я скажу почему, слишком много читеров был бы у рокстар нормальные сервера и бан по железу может их бы и не было но все же, роки делают миссии которые были только кооператив уже в соло гениально же да? Или вот идешь ты продавать там товар какой-то игра тебе говорит получишь по 5к за каждого человека в сессии дополнительно за продажу, а в сессии толкучка из 30+- человек. Последние обновления сделаны из готовых ассетов игры потому-что добавлять что-то новое игра уже не вывозит и они успешно вырезали из игры про автоугон 1/7 машин и мотоциклов из списков на сайтах, за то яхту которая никому не всралась и чисто понтанутся они оставили Достижение вообще не о чем, умудрились сделать их вообще не интересными в получении, а наоборот жопоразрывающим и скучным занятием по поиску 30 кусков подлодки, ядерки и тд,  Мой вердикт таков что я не рекомендую покупать гта 5 в 2023 году, купите лучше что-то другое например рдр2 или там Atomic Heart, Sabnautica: Below Zero. Я бы не покупал игру но мне её подарили. Кто думает что я забыл про графу ""Плюсы игры"" мой вам ответ, а в чем радость игра в заезжаное говно 2013 года которое как лагало на дате выхода так до сих пор и лагает но чуточку меньше, в чем радость хавать говно под видом что тебе это нравится? Мне это все не сильно нравится.  Я закончу пожалуй на этом свой трактат."
Extremely fun story and online
uh W game

"mmm not worth it if yuo  a baby about getting killed in gta online, the game is good tho besides the ppl that complain abt dieing"
very fun and exciting to enjoy on the daily!

"Graphics: 9999999/10 Gameplay: 9999999/10 Story: 9999999/10 Online: a decent 7/10💀💀💀💀  One of the best games ever. It definitely survived the test of time. Best graphics, very interactive map, amazing attention to details, physics is also good. 👍  I don't think anyone would even read my review so i'm just gonna say i ate bacon and pancakes for breakfast 🤣"

"There is a ton of modders and you will blow up a lot. People will hold grudges against you if you kill them once, even on accident. They will then get out a tank and spawn camp you. 10/10 fabulous game!"

The pain in the a** that rock star creates to simply unlink your steam account blows my mind.
"got on and imediatly got kicked from session. not more than 5 minutes later i got a glitch that froze my entire game, the gta experience. for a billion dollar company  this game should be much better"
its so fantastic
"Ah, nigga, don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful nigga. Maybe if you got rid of that old yee-yee ass haircut, you got you'd get some bitches on your dick. NIGGAAAAAAA"

"Especially with recent changes to what you can and cannot do in private sessions, now is a great time to jump into GTA Online - provided you have friends with you to mitigate some of the grind fatigue."
Not able to log in to a 13 y/o game because you need activation code from the all new and shit rockstar social app is the new low for the gaming industry.
Doesn't need the review.

"Very good game, I have over 2000 hours in my epic games GTA"
É GTA caraio... q porra de descrição o q?! O único defeito desse jogo são os jogadores.
i like killing people
this game is very nice
if you find something you enjoy they will probably ruin it in the next update.
add more sex trust me your sales will go thorough the roof
WY GAME IS LAGGING
Rob money. Buy thing. Repeat.
"ive played gta since release on play station, then on computer.. Rockstar doesnt care at all to fix hackers that will 100% ruin your game expirience. hackers will destroy your missions, disconnect you from game, and all kinds of stuff that company doezsnt care at all to fix. they fix only the glitches that affect in game money, that ruins them the income from buying ingame currency with real money. other than that hackers run rampage for a decade without anyone care to fix anything. if hackers didnt exist this game in online multiplayer would be one of the best games i ever played with friends, but sadly is unplayable"
I committed more than just Grand Theft Auto

A great Game for all to play. You can mess around or play with your friends in Online mode and you can complete one of the best games of all time in the story mode. if you are a gamer this game is essential and it never gets and it never will get old. :)
mods = fun

Just like every other GTA Sacrifices map size for graphics and same old beating the dead horse. rockstar should've paid more attention to RDR2 which WAS GREAT FIGHT ME. and would've been better if rockstar gave a fuck. san andreas will always be the only good one to me. keep making trash give us more red dead
"Why do you force us to login to that GARBAGE social club! the GARBAGE does NOT WORK!! cant login, so cant play GTA5!! REMOVE THAT GARBAGE, and we might play the game again... this is just BAD!! REALLY REALLY RETARDED BAD!!!"
This game rocks. Cars go broom and gun go boom. I am the one who knocks

Awesome game on every platform ever played
Best video game ever made. Looking forward to GTA 6.
i love it get it NOW
"It's unfortunate there is yet to be another game as ambitious as this one. A game that could rival the decade old GTA V in scope, a game that could be owned and operated by a competent company that actually cares about the state of their project and the satisfaction of the community.   It's a travesty that GTA V is the only game in its class, because Rockstar sucks. I'll never understand how I've amassed over a thousand hours on this shit-show of a game that progressively gets worse in an infinite loop of one step forward, two steps back. It's clear that Rockstar wants to push the game in a FOMO direction, and they're not subtle about it in any way. They removed the ability to purchase hundreds of vehicles that had been added over time, and they now drip-feed a handful of them every week. The ""GTA+"" battlepass shlock they're pushing on consoles is only further indicative of this direction. They want to incentivize players to pay exuberant prices for in-game content instead of providing more viable means of earning currency in-game. As I write this, Rockstar is allegedly planning to nerf the BEST way to make money in the game, on the basis of wanting to, ""provide players with greater incentives to experience the full range of content available."" Why not just make EVERYTHING to be a viable source of income? Why not increase the payouts of adversary modes and content missions, why not make outdated businesses with poor payouts like Import/Export actually viable? Because at the end of the day, Rockstar's main goal is to make money. They don't care about encouraging variety in their gameplay: They want players to give up the grind and give in to micro-transactions. It's too bad that the GTA community doesn't have the same solidarity and willpower as other communities—I'm looking at you, War Thunder. Perhaps if the community created enough of an uproar, things would change for the better.   But even if we ignore the blatant greed of Rockstar and the way they have gradually fucked over the economy of the game, the state of GTA Online on PC is sad. Rockstar has almost entirely neglected the game. Everyone knows about the modders. They're not that big a deal, apart from the ones who have the ability to crash the game for YOU specifically (among other malicious exploits I've yet to encounter), but they are still a nuisance.   On top of the godmode abusers present in every lobby, there's a whole set of content that PC players have been refused access to—content entirely exclusive to current gen consoles. Why? No one fucking knows! Rockstar is anything BUT transparent: It has been over a year since the ""Expanded and Enhanced"" edition of GTA released for those platforms, yet Rockstar has never once broken silence about the delayed released of the content on PC. The entire lack of communication between the community and the developers is inexcusable.  I've put a lot of time into this game, and I still continue to despite my grievances, but it's not worth it. If you've yet to play GTA Online, or you're considering returning, heed my words: Do not waste your time with this game. At least not in the way I have. Have fun blowing your friends up with bazookas. Just try not to get caught up in the intoxicating pursuit of wealth.  That said, GTA V's story isn't bad. A bit dated, sure, but I'd reckon it's still worth playing."
"Great missions, collectables+driving sucks, beautiful world and a lot of easter eggs. Enjoy it!"
good missing CJ tho
"cars, guns and money."
This is total bs  I paid maybe 25-30$ for this so I can play online ofc because I've been playing GTA 5 since 2013 so   HACKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"GTA V is a game about driving, flying, shooting, and heists. However, the driving, flying, shooting, and heists are awful."
This game was 10 years old now and it's still awesome. wish there was a DLC on single player though.
BEST GAME IN THIS WORLD
nice gamee....
Good! But I need macos support now
Too good
"GTA 5 online for the first time I logged in then, don’t log in just forever loading I don’t recommend buying GTA 5 online"
u should have a good pc and skills to play this game
"Really good game, good open world storymode and freeroam! Waiting for GTA VI too. Congrats!"
Tunings are life
"this game is still getting better, and better. A all time classic, with a sequel i look forward too, as i know it will be on another level....too bad those hackers slash cheaters need too be dealt with somehow someway....PEACE"

This game is good! it was great before rockstar removed over 400 vehicles. i enjoy playing gta online but its more of a group game. its impossible to get anything done without a group and sadly rockstar killed their fan base unless your on a console. all in all im uninstalling the game. its just a waste of time to play this game by myself

"This game is really fun, if you want something to do in it just join someones invitation to a heist or heist setup. its not boring!!!!!"
"played on console and on pc, sad that online isn't crossplay <pc/console> but still fun! graphics and missions are fairly good and a good variety and being able to run side missions for your ceo stuff is a bonus for sure! being able to customize your character and cars is a favorite and being able to go to different shops and buy a variety or things from clothes and snacks to tattoos and armor is very cool [sometimes the players on online can be annoying and toxic but not too much you can do and is similar to other types of franchises as well<not a big deal if you like all that though>]"
the intro song is the only music ill listen to in this game
"Get this for its main story, ignore gta online you will hate it in the long run if you dont lose interest first. If you want gta multiplayer install FiveM it makes gta 5 online look like a poorly written joke."
This game ruined my life.
"IT'S GTAV, WHATS NOT TO LIKE... GRAPHICS, CONSTANT UPDATES, DLC'S, IMPROVEMENTS AND WE'RE NOT BEING ROBBED FOR DLC'S"
"good game, m.A.A.d city"
its take so long for connect in online
you know exactly what this game is.
very much fun
"This is a 2013 title with ten years of useless seedy DLC content injected.  Unmodded GTA Online is full of hackers making GTA V worthless at best. (as a c-tier school shooter simulator with terrible graphics).     The campaign is a slogfest of trail/follow missions and cutscenes containing cringy 2010 era anti-celebrity, anti-wealth satire. Los Santos has never felt so small."
this game is so amazing and i love open world and action

Fantastic Game
it is so good from the story to online all perfect. def worth the money
i love robbing
dis my top 3 game probably so yea
"GTA V is an incredible evolution of the series. For players of GTA 3 and GTA San Andreas, it's a highly satisfying experience. The open world is beautiful, the graphics are advanced, and the story is deep, making it unforgettable. The three-character system and variety of missions make it addictive. Los Santos offers unparalleled freedom for exploration. GTA V is a must-play for fans of the series."
🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
its gta been out for 10 years nothing new filled with hackers WHY NOT??
Can a loc come up in yo crib?
Great game. You're not a gamer if you haven't tried GTA 5!
Bad. Spend most of your time in the clouds because Rockstar is to cheap to get dedicated servers....
Played on ps4 for 3 years level 38 played on pc 41 hours level 38
"i really liked the fact that you can almost do anything in this game and the best part is the online , where you can enjoy the thrilling heist and missons with your friends or alone and can build your own story i really liked the online part more than the story itself inact i have never finished the story i really enjoy playing the game with my friends."
Only played it for a bit. It's alright.
"HURRY UP AND COME OUT WITH 6,IT'S ALWAYS OPEN ONLINE"
single player: masterpiece online: bruh  i got hacked by chinese email bruhhhh
too many cars and guns for my liking but its fun to sell meth and scuba dive
Vehicular manslaughter
FULL OF HACKERS AND MODDERS.  cant even complete basic missions without game kicking me out or cars start sliding all over the place.  players that are level 8000 and stuff... pretty sad rockstar cant just make a fun game that works.  micro transactions are ruining the gaming world.  greedy rockstar. wont be buying gta 6
w game frl
this was one of the best game
gangbangezr weinezr lovezrz
requires an internet to play an offline game
Ive always loved GTA
"At the very least, the single player is very comical and fun. If its on sale get it.  Online is a bit of a mixed bag. Very, very grindy, but the heists are all very fun. YMMV."
Grand Theft Auto V and Online is a flawed masterpiece. But for some reason I can't stop playing the damn game.
"Such a great story, but 10 years later the game has no support whatsoever for PC. I mean you can request support for regular stuff. They just haven't fixed PC version. Hackers still roam, you can't load into sessions (specifically joining friends is broken, you get stuck in loading screens, missions break, and lobbies always end up ruined by someone with a mod menu. Save your money. At this point if you haven't played it yet, just wait for 6 to come out."
I literally only play LSPDFR nowadays on this game
gfhthfghfgh
Hit a woman in the back of the head and got 19 dollars

Online mode is fun with friends but sh!t in random lobbies.   when gta6
"From start to finish the ""story"" really tells you a decent story. I've personally never seen anything special in grand theft auto. (aside from story missions you can steal cars and kill NPC's and play tennis or visit the club but ive never cared about any of that) aside from the modding community and RP servers and such the campaign in my opinion is really the only cool thing about this."
One of the bestselling games of all time for a reason. I can't wait for GTA 6 to arrive!
bad game never loads and is constly lagging
its dont working
its a very good game. many fun things to do in this game. ALthough this game is really cool and fun.  The game takes way to much storage. 100 GB!!
"Great game, pretty good and sarcasm filled story too!"
i love it asdf movie 3
"its a very interactive task filled game and i love it and even if u dont wanna do tasks at the moment theres other things to do such as go to the casino,go shopping,steal cars,relax in your apartment,etc,and i love the story mode and online both are so fun,and interactive,also the graphics and quality of the game is amazing and even though the game was made in 2015 its still not outdated such a fun game its so worth it buy it"
"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
daddy lester
gun go brrrr
"1 hour stuck, installing social club wtf man?"
Fun game in single player

"Game ruled by hackers that can bully you non stop, crash your game and get you account banned. all the while the developers do nothing to stop this  Update. i bought a mod menu. suddenly the game is fun again."

Very fun and engaging.
"I can't launch this game, it always returns the error ""App running"" even though I have never turned it on, and there is no running application in Task manager either. Too bad..."
Its a really good game and really fun to play
pider

so long journey
"There are 2 sides to GTA V, there is the story mode and there is the... online, or I guess you could call it hack-fest. My review isn't on the online portion of the game though. I would have to say the game of GTA V is probably one of the most nostalgic and well crafted game mechanics out there! If I were to recommend this game to anyone I would recommend to play the story! This game has an amazing story to it, well put together and just an all around well told story all the way up to the final missions of the game. The voice acting is top tier! The cast did an amazing job getting you immersed into the story, you can genuinely feel the characters and their emotions I would almost say its kind of like a movie almost. The game works well not very many bugs maybe a few here and there but what game doesn't. This story is one to definitely remember, one of the best stories to a modern day game based in todays society portrayed in a really well put way! There isn't very many games based in our time-frame or our modern life mostly they are based in the future or way in the past or they are horror games. For a game to feel as real as GTA V with top tier voice acting and a well put together story I would have to recommend this game for that reason alone... don't play online."
i was chiling in my car and opresor mk2 just bombed me
BEST OPEN WORLD
"this game made me change my legal name to trevor, and it’s not even a joke"
This game is really good its worth the price:)

"don't feel like getting my internet shut off, no thanks"
It's GTA V. There isn't really any explanation needed. It's GTA V
This game is awsomd
its a fun game and play it
best game to play when you are bored
"4 of those hours were in the loading screen, im not playing around."
"Spent over 200 hours just doing random stuff, still haven't completed story mode. Online is super fun even with the modders, there's ways to get your own servers without having to deal with being locked out of options and I highly recommend doing that if you want to enjoy online mode."
great game but lots of moders
aaauuuuuggggghhhhhh
this with payday hiest would go crazy
Good story. I like the multiple characters. Trevor is an especially fun character to play when in the mood for mindless violence. (That is his superpower after all).

"[h1] My GTA V Review [/h1] [h3] Rating: 4 out of 10 stolen cars [/h3] [hr][/hr]  [h2] Graphics [/h2] The graphics of the game are good, and even though the game was released over 10 years ago, you can still enjoy them. However, graphics are not the most important aspect, as we all know.  [h2] User Interface [/h2] The user interface is simple yet clear; I have absolutely nothing to complain about in this regard.  [h2] Performance [/h2] With my PC, I've never had any issues with the game and could always play it at maximum settings. However, this also depends on the type of PC you have.  [h2] Controls [/h2] The controls are simple and fully customizable, but they could offer more (I personally miss functions like being able to lie down in combat, and sometimes, the weapon wheel behaves a bit strangely).  [h2] Story in Singleplayer & Characters [/h2] The story mode is decent. The narrative isn't outstanding but is still interesting. The three main characters are well-written, although they can sometimes come across as cliché. Nonetheless, each of them has a (limited) background story, and you understand their motivations for their individual actions. Unfortunately, I personally miss the ability to influence the story or at least individual missions and the option of three different endings doesn't make it any better when the path to them is absolutely linear, and as a player, you have no influence on the game world or anything else. I'll give half a point for the singleplayer heists, which offer at least two different approaches for most heists, providing some variety.  [h2] Character, Weapon, and Car Customization & Modifications [/h2] I think it's cool that you can customize, tune, and paint your weapons and cars as you wish, both in singleplayer and multiplayer. There are more options available for cars, which makes sense. When it comes to clothing, it's a bit different. While you can customize your character in multiplayer and distribute outfits accordingly, you can't do the same in singleplayer. The outfits of the playable characters always reset (unfortunately, you also can't change the main vehicle of the three main characters in singleplayer).  [h2] Immersion [/h2] While the game world of GTA V initially looks lively because it's filled with NPCs going about their activities, it becomes clear that it's not quite as dynamic as it appears. NPCs sometimes behave strangely, repeat the same animations when certain events occur, and sometimes, they don't even have a sense of orientation. For instance, I observed a police car ramming into my car repeatedly for about 3 minutes instead of simply going around it. It's also bizarre how quickly you can accumulate wanted stars from the police and how fast they arrive, respawn, and seem to always know your exact location. Another annoying feature in multiplayer is the calls you receive every time you enter the game. These are usually 2 to 4 calls from NPCs telling you the same things. You have to answer these calls each time before you can hang up.  [h2] City & Game World Exploration [/h2] The game world is large, offering a variety of different areas, making it feel like a realistic city and its surroundings. There's a large urban area representing a typical US city, areas with a lot of nature, and smaller, more remote towns.  [h2] Music [/h2] The music in the missions is okay but nothing special. What I find fantastic, however, is the selection of radio stations; there's something for every musical taste, and if someone can't find anything they like, there's the feature to add your own music. Simply fantastic!  [h2] Gameplay & Missions in Online Mode [/h2] After about 10 years, the online mode is a joke. Initially, when I bought the game, I liked it because of the many options for character customization, apartments, garages, and the open world to explore and complete missions. Unfortunately, the game, at least for me, quickly became boring because the missions are often the same or similar, making it less enjoyable.  [h2] New Content & Updates? [/h2] Over the years, some content has been added to the multiplayer (not always good content), while the singleplayer was left empty. New cars and weapons were never implemented in the singleplayer, probably because they couldn't make additional money from it.  [h2] Online Balancing & Pay to Win [/h2] In multiplayer, there are sometimes ridiculously overpowered weapons and cars that throw the game's balance out the window. These items, as well as some clothing and cars, are so expensive that it's tedious to earn them in-game. But luckily, you have the option to buy Shark Cards (in-game currency) with real money! (Sarcasm) This way, you can have the perfect combination of overpriced in-game items that pay-to-win players can easily acquire (if they're willing to invest their hard-earned money into an online game)...  [h2] Apartments & Garages [/h2] When I saw that it was possible to buy apartments and garages at the beginning, I was excited and saved up until I could afford one. Unfortunately, the disappointment was greater than I expected: from the cheapest to the most expensive, they have very few functions (except for being chosen as spawn points and some having a garage for cars). You can interact with some things, like drinking smoothies, watching TV, or getting your character so drunk that they pass out. While garages still serve a purpose, apartments are pretty much useless (unless you want to plan heists). You're better off investing your extra money in a good armored car or weapons.  [h2] Cheaters & Modding [/h2] I could maybe overlook these other issues if GTA Online could finally deal with the wave of cheaters. The problem existed years ago, and it still exists today. Players who play normally get banned, partly because of cheaters (who might shower you with a ton of money in a short time, resulting in an automatic ban), while players who obviously cheat, using explosive ammunition, becoming invincible, teleporting, or blatantly spawning cars, whales, or Ferris wheels, don't get banned, or it takes forever. Today was the first time in a while that I played GTA V, and when I entered multiplayer, it was hard to find a lobby without at least one cheater unless you're in a private session.  [h2] Replayability [/h2] I would play the game again for the story mode, as I currently do. While other games have captivated me more, it always depends on personal preference and the type of games one prefers. To experience different endings or have an alternative to multiplayer, it's worth it.  [h2] Summary [/h2] If you're interested in the story mode, I can still recommend it, but the multiplayer is absolutely not worth it (anymore).  Rating: 4 out of 10 stolen cars, would not recommend"
GOOD JUST WAITING NOW FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS TILL GTA 6 COMES OUT
epic story very detailed good settings and good online mode.
ben
its a great game but the launcher isnt working goddamnit
roses are red violets are blue I shot a civilian and stole his car
bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
col geme
shi fye
the best part of the game is when the cheaters break you into buying cheats
fun if pc actual works
Had to buy GTA again due to rockstar shitty social club linked accounts
The game has aged very well over these 10 years
"Hi, I'm Ryan Gosling."
bit repetitive but amazing like usual with rockstar
STUPID GAME WITH STUPID GLITCHES GO FUCK UR SELFS
No sex:(
"Ahh nigga don’t hate me cause I’m beautiful nigga. Maybe if you got rid of that old yee - yee ass haircut, you’d get some bitches on yo dick. Oh, better yet maybe Tanisha’ll call your dog ass if she stops fuckin’ with that brain surgeon or lawyer she fucking with. Nigga"

it is verey fun

amazing game even after 10 years <3
Gta is a highly recommended game. Highly detailed and fun Multiplayer with friends. I have owned it on 4 devices now. That is how much I love the game. Extreme detail.
gta 5 pc lobbies = tf2 xbox 360 lobbies
a lot of assignment waste time.and it is also boring
Stripper club best place
"Wanna play a game with a wild story, endearing characters, and a seemingly ""alive"" world?  Or maybe you want to steal some old man's car, play a round of golf, rob a convenience store to buy some time with a ""working girl"", and drive off a cliff while she gives you a good time?  If any of that seems appealing, you might be insane, and this game is perfect for you."
"my favourite part is when michael said ""its grand theft time"" and he auto V'd all over the place"
Such a great game
"Thanks Rockstar for the memories and also for the help with my account, they were so helpful!"
"very good , its fluxuation value of morality entice my thought exubirently . and the cherry on the cake is how gargantuam the map is bring a large texture of detail to this facinating piece of art"
its okay not that much fun
One of the greatest games ever made. Both online and offline mods are the best in their class.
Imagine 40 FPS on RTX 2070
"one of the best games of the early 2010s, HOWEVER, the online experience is not balanced, overrun with bots and griefers, and simply unfun without blowing your child's college fund on shark cards."
Really great game but their is map glitch in story mode fps stuck in story mode and not the problem in online.....
"Do not buy GTA on epic games, if you got it for free on there do not download, it is to much of a hassal to get it up to date with the newer gen GTA versions, this is why I was buy it on steam, because steam is way easier to navigate, over 600k games, and overall, better than epic games. - NoT_KBTvr"
story good
this game is outstanding......after 10 years it has that popularity when it was released  I AM A NEW PLAYER..... anyone did not known its a good game after play this game I will say everyone came to buy this game after known itz a good game
One of the best games in the world
this game has a really great story mode but the online version ruins my day everytime i think about it.
"The campaign is hands down one of the best in video-game history. The online mode however, is full of hackers who blow up lobbies, making it impossible to do missions and other activities."
When is GTA VI
the game is realy nic e in liked it
"Very addicting, fun to play with friends, and probably the best game i have right now"
Goated game. Still waiting for Gta 6 -.-
really one of the best games EVER honest would buy!
"best gta game so far, m personal favourite"

"Potentially the worst support service I've ever seen, no fucks given unless its about shark cards and overrun with hackers.  At least spit on it before you slam it inside me for GTA 6  With all the money you've earned, you could at least give us content that isn't riddled with bugs and written by fucking monkeys"
played only 4 story mode lol
GodGame
Trevor phillips
a very good game bbwac
The best game ever except for the players and the connection is so sloww
"They ruined the game even more, and I can't even launch from steam anymore. Adding layers off bloatware and excess accounts to a once well functioning game. Gameplay is also completely drowned in mods and hackers."
if your name is fishyvancooki i will find you. your time is short so make what memoirs you can cause their nothing awaiting you in the after life but misery and disappointment. your blood line ends here you miserable sack of shit ill hunt you till rockstar gives us GTA6 (they wont)
GREAT GAME IVE PLAYED IT SINCE I WAS 8
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
It is a Super fun game that In my opinion everyone must have
Add animals on GTA V online xd

"Doesnt let you play a game you purchased. Its asking me to log into some random social club email I've never owned, I can't even play a game I purchased offline."
very fun punching all the fat pedestrians
10 OUT OF 10
its good for if you want to kill civilians
This garbage needs a social club account to work even offline. If you loose your social club account you loose the game too. Rockstar Games is trash.
"great game!, i would recomend this to anyone in the world!!"
"GTA V used to be that one game ""everyone liked"" or ""everyone could play"" as of writing this review I haven't touched this game since the merryweather update. if any newer player to this series of the games Rockstar have made. It isn't worth it. Rockstar needs to change before its worth it. i ask for players to find another game. this company deserves nothing. this game was my childhood and I'm sad to say it no longer is. Imagine call of duty releasing a game with an AK 47 based gun and a M4-A1 based gun and removing both guns and putting it in a shop for console only players."

Super fun
This game made me rob a convenient store
A decade old and still going strong. Can't wait for the next one!
This game is great! I've played this game only once before today and I would say that this was a good deal.

"as much as i use to love this game, seems GTAV is no longer playable on newer hardware (at least in my case)  - i7 10700k -64gb 3600mhz ddr4  -rtx 3070 -4x4 tb sata ssds -2x2 tb samsung 980 pro -samsung 1080p 144hz monitor  i should theoretically be able to run the game at max settings with no less then 100fps which would be fine, but it seems in the last few updates somethings gone very wrong and i get drops and freezes every few minutes regardless of what settings i choose, ive used both the latest windows 10 and windows 11 pro, took out my 3070 and swapped in a 2070s assuming maybe my gpu was at fault, still hefty stuttering, freezing and frame drops again regardless of settings.  ive even played the game on a i5 10600/rtx 2060/32gb ram and still no joy.   im hoping that GTAV keeps reciveing updates and one of them fixes the issue.  peace out -B"

gta b5 fortnite playa
its cwool
Honestly a good game. I like the open world experience while still having a linear feel to it.
a blimp blew up outside and killed 15 people while i tried to leave my house  i then proceeded to rob a bank as a black man from an 80s family comedy show and escape from the cops listening to mexican party music  truly a deep and inspiring experience
Very epic game with friends!
This game could replace therapy. Actual therapy minigame along with pure unadulterated violence. Highly recommend for fellow mentally ill people
"Everyone knows this game, I don't even get why people who aren't critics are writing reviews from this."
its okay ig
ive had better experiances getting on a flight through TSA then joining an Online Lobby
very good  game played it since 2015
I jumped off a motercycle and drop kicked a innocent civillian at max speed. I later died to a shotgun blast to the face. 10/10 would reccommend
Fun Fly Fun Shoot die

MUST TRY
Can't wait for GTA 6 to make gaming great again
i cant play the game even though I bought it because it requires a fucking social rockstar club which I already forgotten

"Even though I've got 559 hours into this game, I still would never recommend it. It is literally plagued with hackers. I mean, the hacks in this game are just so easy to get, and are so varied that you won't play half an hour without at least one PVP'ing the entire zone, dropping cash that'll get everyone banned, or screwing the environment so much you'll eventually just log out of frustrating instance hopping. The hacks get better as time goes on, and the detection of the devs gets worse. Most of my 500+ hours were spent back before it was just a huge hackfest."

gta ist das coolste spiel der welt
its the best game for killing
If you want to play Story mode. Definitely go for it. But online mode absolutely sucks. It stays on loading screen forever time and again. Every time there's a loading screen I'd have my fingers crossed that this shouldn't get stuck but happens most of the times. Starting a Solo session is still in good shape and doesn't stuck that much. But joining public session is a real pain in the ASS.

"I still like the game despite the storage needed for the PC. I'm just glad it runs perfectly fine on my PC. Just lower the graphics, I guess. But still overall a 10/10 for me! It might not be the same for others but who cares?"

i like cars
awesome game not suitable for children...
They removed half the cars for no reason
Amazing game to play with friends.
"Buyer beware- Do not purchase this game with the expectation that you'll actually be able to play this game in public lobbies. Every. Single. Lobby is filled with kids using Mod Menus. I won't list all the stuff that they do but it's constant kicking from lobby, crashing your game, forcing animations on your character, teleporting you to random missions in the game, dropping weapons on your character that are a major pain to get rid of, taking control of your character when driving or doing anything, removing all cars from lobby.   These mods make all the load times longer. & guess what happens to the poor kids that report these blatant cheaters? The mod menu notifies the mod user that a report has been sent, tells them who sent the report, and blocks the report from ever making it to the server. So guess who starts getting harassed? A young unsuspecting kid.   Online is unplayable, it's a horrible experience. Rockstar promoting the PC version of this game as ""Online"" is nothing short of fraud. There is no online, there are public lobbies filled with modders. Absolute dumpster fire.  If you purchase this game with the intention of playing it online, I assure you, you will be very disappointed."
L  edit: W
i feel successful in life playing this game
Really fun.
Los angeles does not look this good in real life
"Better off playing the story and role playing servers than the pure garbage of a cash grab online mode which you seriously need great internet protection from modders/hackers in the online game if you don't want to end up having your internet destroyed. So yeah don't play online, Rockstar Games doesn't care for your opinions and your safety."
"While there are Loads of great reasons to play, the few that make it VERY hard to play could have been mostly fixed over the years. i.e. The incredibly poor match making system; while the game is cross platform finding a group (and almost ALL missions REQUIRE 4 people) the only people it will match you with are existing people in the CURRENT instance you are in, mixed with a few ""quick job"" joiners. Another example would be the very long load times, I mean VERY long, and on top of that there are a lot of times the game ""Fails to load session"" so after spending 2-3 hours getting a squad that is not just people trying to ruin the run (Who are in no way punished for Griefing a squad even if reported nothing will get done) your game will get stuck loading or give a ""Failed to join session"" error pretty frequently thus undoing your hours of work.  In short, Rockstar games Could have taken the loads of money and fixed some stuff but have never done so. these basic game functions failing along with other players regularly (Very common) using cheat codes /trainers to teleport to you take your money, kill you with a rocket at point blank range and teleport to the next player in the session (Never being punished even when reported you will see the same people still doing the same thing. Unless this is just for single player story, I would never recommend this game as anything other than a waste of time..."
hhhhhhh
asss game to many hacker
"Played for a while and have around 400 million dollars and level 384, this game was fun because other people can play with you"
i got banned for modding thats so unfair smh
"the game looks like ass, the ps3 version was better in every way, when you go into the online part every car is limited to 60mph, and you cant shoot your guns, just punch, also you cant use any kind of controller like a steering wheel or yolk, and your psn/xbox controllers arnt that responsive for some reason, so if i was you, id only play this dumpster fire on consoles"

ITS GTA HOW CAN YOU NOT LIKE IT
legao
"fun, would recommend mowing down pedestrians!"
its fun to play this game 10/10 ngl
dick in  my ass
gta rp is so much fun
"""Grand Theft Auto V: My Second Life as a Digital Daredevil""  Rating: ★★★★★  Grand Theft Auto V, the game where I've discovered my alter ego as a digital daredevil. Move over, Evel Knievel, I've got a rocket-propelled motorcycle and a thirst for mayhem!  Pros:  - I've learned that in Los Santos, the traffic lights are mere suggestions. Green, red, or blue, I'll drive through them all - and sometimes even the buildings! - The game's pedestrians have a unique way of coping with chaos. They'll scream, curse, and sometimes even join me in my criminal escapades, like they've been waiting for a chance to break bad. - I've become a fashion icon. Whether I'm sporting a tuxedo while robbing a bank or a Hawaiian shirt while parachuting from a helicopter, I'm always dressed for success. - GTA V has taught me that versatility is key. One minute, I'm a mastermind heist planner, the next, I'm a stuntman extraordinaire, and then I'm just a guy trying to play golf in the middle of a gang war.  Cons:  - My sense of traffic rules is a bit skewed in the real world now. My passengers aren't thrilled when I try to reenact my highway adventures. - My friends and I have turned every online session into a chaotic competition. Who can survive the longest with a 5-star wanted level? Who can jump a motorcycle over the most rooftops? The winner gets bragging rights, but everyone else ends up in the hospital. - I've developed a habit of looking for hidden packages in real life, hoping to stumble upon a stash of cash or a shiny weapon upgrade. So far, no luck. - GTA V has ruined my ability to watch a movie without considering how much chaos I can cause with a helicopter in that same scenario.  Grand Theft Auto V is a digital playground where you can embrace your inner outlaw, explore a sprawling virtual city, and create the most insane stories with friends. It's the kind of game where you'll start a mission but end up in a completely unrelated adventure, like skydiving into a military base just for kicks.  To those considering a visit to this virtual world: Buckle up, enjoy the madness, and remember that in GTA V, the only limit is your imagination, and the occasional rocket launcher.  In conclusion, GTA V is where I've learned that sometimes, life's best moments happen when you drive off the beaten path... literally.  Overall rating: ★★★★★"
Its aged horrifically
"Don't fund Rockstar.  I love the GTA series, but I hate Rockstar. Rockstar ain't what it used to be, all the good people left and now it is one big corporate scam. Like you can see online, all multiplayer services are terrible and compromised too. In such manner that people, like me, and millions of others, can see where you life with a single click. You don't have to be an expert, with 30$ and one google search you too can be a scummy ""hacker""  Rockstar always cuts down on their spending, keeping only the worst possible solutions (anti cheat, if you can call it that..) while they knowingly scam a majority of minors with their shark cards, crappy dlc's and casino tricks which get people (mainly minors as the demographic show, which they also have btw) to return for their scummy digital currency which is absolutely worthless.  Trainers are cheap and widely available, don't waste your time grinding a game that is held in low to no regard by it's developers.  My main problem is that I can no longer play and Rockstar ""support"" which are a bunch of nobodies stuck in a office, no braining responses, decided that they can't solve the problem they caused but also refuse to properly read or trace back conversations that took place within 12 hours of time.  The launcher was once again ""updated"" and I am now locked out ""Can you please login manually"" to an email that has ""@1*3.com"" in it, like I know a mail provider or service which provides such a strange string as email address. Clearly this is generated, they linked it, it is their fault, their responsibility and they give f*ck all.  1. I don't know this email 2. I have not been hacked, social club and steam are linked by rockstar, that is the only thing that happened. 3. If I can't access a rockstar generated email and they refuse to provide support, which they have then I am locked out of my game, which I payed for and legally should have access too.  The repercussions taken here should be: 1. Steam should monitor unfair and illegal actions from companies towards their client base 2. Rockstar should treat their costumers like people and not like trash or robots   Rockstar, Sam Houser, Take-Two Interactive, Strauss Zelnick, from the deepest point in my heart, f*ck you and everything you think you stand for. I will never buy GTA 6 which was rightfully leaked because you have a team of evil d*pshit devs."
i hate this game they ban me bcuz im coloured
MODS ARE SO FIRE ON THIS GMAE
its.... good
its fun and you can do anything
SHUT THE FUCK UP
Fun game. For Online: 1. Use a VPN 2. Try to play with friends 3. Get gud scrub.
"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) stands as a true masterpiece of open-world gaming, and it's not hard to see why. Rockstar Games has crafted an experience that delivers on every front, from its expansive open world to its captivating characters and engaging gameplay.  One of GTA V's most striking features is the sprawling, beautifully detailed city of Los Santos. The level of realism and attention to detail is nothing short of astonishing. Whether you're cruising down the busy streets, exploring the gritty neighborhoods, or soaring over the stunning landscape in an aircraft, the world feels alive and dynamic. The diversity of environments, from the urban jungle to the tranquil countryside, adds to the game's immersive quality.  But it's not just about the world; it's the people who inhabit it that make GTA V shine. The game's three protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—are incredibly well-developed and offer distinct personalities and backgrounds. Their intertwining stories create a narrative that's engaging and full of memorable moments. The voice acting is top-notch, making these characters feel like real people with their quirks and flaws.  The sheer variety of activities and missions is staggering. From high-octane heists that require meticulous planning to offbeat side missions that can range from absurd to touching, GTA V keeps you constantly entertained. The game never forces you down a linear path, allowing you to explore at your own pace and choose how you want to tackle missions."
Has anyone encountered this issue? plz help!  So whenever i start my gta 5 i come in to the loading screen and as soon its loaded i come in a public session my game shuts off and i come back to steam.  Please help Gta is one of my favorite games to play Plz help...
"This game fucking sucks lol.  Between a billion game breaking bugs, everything constantly crashing, horrendous enemy balancing, and some absolutely dogshit players, I should not like GTA V.  But good lord is it fun.   Playing this game (with friends) is an absolutely ridiculous, stupid, and fun experience. In between productive segments, things almost always break down into inter-group mayhem and it's the funniest thing every single time. No other game allows me to finish a mission with friends and then immediately send them flying cross-map with the ass end of my car.   Also just, really good for putting on a podcast and keeping your hands busy for a few hours. Hell, that makes up about half of the hours I do have.   overall, this game is not good, but it's fun, and I can absolutely recommend it for its now miniscule price."
"God game. Drugs, killing, crime. Good story"
there leaving pc behind

FIX YOUR GAME ROCKSTAR
very bad game . i will play it again
"PC is full of cheaters. Any lobby you join will have someone instantly killing you, spawning random things places, teleporting around, etc.  Yes, you can ""solo lobby"" it, but whats the point of playing an online game solo? If cheaters were actually held accountable it wouldn't get this bad."
strip club 7/10  security kicked me out
the best game ever made........
"I have been playing the GTA series since elementary school but have grown into a non-violent and calm adult. I don't think violent games lead to violence. So, kids reading this article, beg your parents to buy GTA5. (Bonus: You can do all your house chores while loading into the game.)"

"Well where do we start, loading screens galore, hackers galore, literally hackers that make you shut your pc down and restart. Not to mention how much rockstar FORCES you to do the same repetitive jobs with idiots thatt don't have a clue as to whats going on. Worst waste of time, left feeling like rockstar OWES me $ for playing their game."
no very fucking boring
Best open world RPG game
NEVER GIVE ME THIS FUCKING GAME EVER AGAIN I HOPE I DIE BEFORE I PLAY ONLINE LEGIT AGAIN
i love fivem thats really all i play with gta5
I played this game at gun point by mister20kk
"THE gameplay, characters, graphics , mission game engagement is osm"
"One of the best games of all time. Hands down. I have over 200 hours clocked on PSN, but PC allows for custom servers and RP. No other game is quite like it, except RDR2. 9.5/10."
"Amazing gameee! It has its faults on the online mode but the story mode is absolute amazing! I don't know where to starts but I can state the following: I fell in love with most of the charters and the world real fast, The open world is very expansive and lively!, The humor can be conversational to some; but some of it really made me giggle!, The radio music is amazing ...peroid, and I really enjoyed the plot of the story mode in general.  The online mode is good but a lot of it is full of low-life losers who use cheats and has quite a few glitches. The online can be fun though and I'm active on the online."
Entertaining and cool I guess .
I LOVE KILLING HOOKERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Too many hackers for which Rockstar couldn't care less to fix.
great awesome story

Happy Birthday GTA.
"A phenomenal campaign and the sandbox of the open world is just such a joy to be in. I often lose myself driving the open world.  The online mode is great, especially with friends but I even enjoy it solo - there are enough ways to make money that it's engaging even after hundreds of hours with tons of things to buy and so much to do."
"Finished the game, it's a really great story with lots of twists. 10/10, would reccomend."
honestly  games fire
"Ten years, 3 consoles, 3 PCs and countless nights grinding away online with some of my best friends. Honestly, the release of GTA VI is going to hurt a little. The base game is a blast and I do recommend it, but really it's just been such a constant in my life at this point, I kind of consider this game a friend."
I love Chicken Strips
"i havent finished the story mode but the online is fun, until you eventually depend on running around the map everytime just to get your paycheck from the business you have been waiting days to be fully stocked up (i swear to god i do not have patience to go ahead with cayo perico, not to count my bad framerate)"

I just modded GTAV with Manual Transmission using Logitech G923 (with force shifter) and WOW. This mod changes everything. It feels like I'm actually driving as my car is being totaled by the cops (force feedback)   Please Rockstar... add this feature to GTAVI. It is possibly the best driving simulation I've experienced other than Asseto Corsa. Just imagine playing cops and robbers with car chasing with this kinda mod.

"When you finally play GTA V 10 years after release and realize it's still cooler than your ex's Instagram feed...  😎🚗 ""Rollin' through Los Santos like a boss!""  🌟 Story: 10/10 GTA V's story hooks you harder than a catfish on a fishing line! It's like binge-watching the best crime drama while being the star of the show. You're in for a ride, and you won't want to get off! 🎥🔥  💥 Open World: 11/10 Los Santos is basically a character in itself. It's like a living, breathing city where anything can happen. From high-speed chases to epic ramp jumps, the possibilities are endless. You're the director of your own action movie!  🎵 Music and Visuals: 9/10 The tunes are so fire, you'll feel like you're in your own music video. And the visuals? It's like someone poured HD sauce all over your screen. You can practically smell the exhaust fumes and feel the city's pulse.  🎯 Missions and Side Missions: 69/10 Every mission is like a mini heist movie. Explosions, shootouts, and more plot twists than a soap opera. And the side missions? They're like little nuggets of gold scattered throughout Los Santos. You'll never run out of things to do!  ⏳ Timeless Classic: 10/10 Playing this 10 years after release, and it's still as fresh as a brand new game! GTA V was basically the Elon Musk of its time—way ahead of the curve. Rockstar really knew what they were doing.  🚀 Overall: 10/10 ""Grand Theft Auto V"" isn't just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon. A game so good, it ages like fine wine. If you haven't played it yet, what are you even doing with your life? Get ready for a ride that'll leave you saying, ""I can't believe I waited this long!"" 🌆🎮"

"I just wanted to share with you all my experience playing GTA V. It's one of the most immersive and entertaining games I've ever played! The attention to detail in the open world is incredible, and the story is both compelling and engaging.  I love how much freedom there is in the game - I can choose how to complete missions and what activities to engage in, and there's always something new to discover. The game's graphics and animations are top-notch, and the driving and shooting mechanics feel very smooth and satisfying.  I've also spent a ton of time exploring the vast multiplayer mode with my friends, which has been an absolute blast. We've tried out all the different game modes available and have had so much fun messing around in the open world with our custom characters.  As a gamer, I can confidently say that GTA V is one of the best games out there right now, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone reading this. With its huge amount of content and incredible replayability, you'll find yourself coming back to GTA V time and again."
super fun i totally recommend this game to anyone who plays any type of video games
The Cayo Perico is nefted as f*ck.  Why is there a limit for my loot?! Why Rockstar?.
Itrs th best
"With [b][i]Grand Theft Auto VI[/i][/b] having *FINALLY* been announced and shown to the world, I decided to go back and play through GTA V. Despite some of my gripes with the main story, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a damn good time, as with the rest of the game. Even after a decade since it released, this game is still an impressive feat in every way and has stood the test of time."
its perfect but hard its amazing but hard its intresting but....
"Its Game Mechanics And Game Story Line Is Interesting And Those Who Want Open World Feel, I'll Prefer This For Them."
"I didn't see hours passing by while playing this, evergreen 😌 Remember playing it with my friend's XBOX 360! D"
A great game to make you feel old and just play the game solo cause all of your old xbox friends are gone
"Cool game, happy 10th anniversary GTA V!"
"i finished this game in 1 week and after that i became boring ,,dont waste 110 gb"
it was good game but it was taking take too much time to load
"out of 90 hours, 80 hours of loading screens."
its awesome! should really try it out!
I really appreciate the amount of time you have put into this game. it has brought me joy and has introduced me to my wife today as I met her through heists. Thank you for creating a good community RIOT GAMES
I like the fact that i can play in an invite only lobby and still make money in online without being greifed by other players using mods or hacks.
Annoying modders suck but its fun i guess
love it fr
"Free roam, Sandbox, Moders, Heist for Story mode and Online and Fanlly Rockstar needs your Money so give them ur money so GTA 6 never comes out. :)"

"Yay, we're going to see airbud!"
"if your new you have to grind hard or spend money to keep up with other legit players or friends that have played longer, but all around gameplay is fun. hackers attempting to compromise accounts almost every update sucks, but with rockstar recently supporting the server host of FIVE-M and such, it'll likely be countered alot sooner as before (i hope. i hope they give the people who actually wanna work on the game enough power to do so basically.)"
good bussin
"Great fucking game, played it multiple times on other account. The offline mode is great, but the onlyne mode is even better, I hope gta6 will come out soon"
"Over 50k people playing at any point during the day, yet I can't find 3 people to complete a Heist. Lovely. 11 out of 10, Can't wait for GTA VI :D"
rockstar is dogshit. online is shit. offline is shit.
"Its a good game! Great if your a grinder, or just a casual looking for some laughs with your friends."
mass murder 10/10 would recommend.
"it's gta, what else can i say."

this game is one of the best open word games if ever playd its the best of the best 10/10
"I've played GTA5 a LOT.  It's fun.  Story is great and challenging. Online play can be a lot of fun with friends, but there are a LOT of other players that just ruin it.  Hacking is a major problem that rockstar won't do anything about.  Nothin is more frustrating than trying to do an open session story mission then having some invincible prick teleport next to you and blow up you and your objective, just for you to have to start it all over again.  There is a work around that get you into and empty session, which is great if you are going about it all solo, but it's not a great work around if you are trying to play with friends.  I think only the delivery missions can't be done in a private (crew, friends, or invite only) session, so that helps a little."
you can fly out of windshields at 250 mph and somehow survive
its good bro

ბესტ გამე ევერ
Even on low end PCs it'll run at max settings
really enjoyable with friends make sure you play with friends and do a private session because there are hackers every where now and its bugging the session as well they are annoying
good game better optimization than gta iv
the best old game
Kill
Such an amazing game !!!!!!

"It's a paradise and fun for those who play the online mode by cheating, but it's an ordeal for those who play the game properly and without cheating."
awsome game 10/10
"Grand Theft Auto, more like Gay Torpedo Asshole."
"An entire decade and I still get 3+ hackers in every session, and still get stuck trying to load into a business. Amazing job Rockstar."

"why are you looking in the negative reviews? go play the game, story mode is great, and online is the cherry on top.  EDIT: nevermind the last part online fucking sucks"
ghc
it is fun to play when your bored but just don't play  it 14 hours a day

"Grand Theft Auto V, waiting for VI...                 Still waiting..."
Would recommend for singleplayer and singleplayer only. Would absolutely not recommend for online. Singleplayer is amazing. Online is by far the worst game I’ve ever played.
yes fun police

"Even if you own in steam you have to launch through rockstar, good luck installing and logging in all in one sitting... then you have to hack into the pentagon in order to verify your identity for you to tell you your password is wrong because you haven't logged into rockstar social club since you were a toddler.   I own this game on steam... let me launch it on steam, my god."
It is a fun game
Shoot bad guys. Get money.
"rockstar you have taken 500 hours of my life, 200 on console, ples i cant launch"

"Great game, loads of content and tons of ways to blow people up and or troll them"
It's fun and there's boobies in it.
"over ten years old, still one of the best active games to play."
"Too many cheaters online. the explode everyone on the map and invincible kind, not the give money/xp kind."
Best game ever cant believe its already been ten years its crazy that it came out on the ps3
just mod it ft.Zolika1351's and MAFINS
I like online
its one of the best games and most iconic games ever made

"Love the game, it's a blast! BUT, It's flooded with hackers, which ruin the game because you can't play at all, even If you're in a private lobby they can join and ruin your fun. And also Rockstar can literally ban you for no reason. I still play the game and love the game, but it gets frustrating."
"Its just GTA 5,everything is just perfect.Still not convinced no problem, enjoy the story, driving car/plane/boat/helicopter/bike/cycle list goes on and on, still don't like the game enjoy gun play, playing sports, playing GTA online with friends, searching for mysteries, enjoying the dark humour of the story, interacting with all characters, grinding for achievements, enjoy just free roaming, playing with car/weapon customisation, getting 5 star wanted level, enjoying the content made by DarkViperAU,TGG,Mors Mutual Insurance,Onespot gaming etc.(list goes on and on of content creators).Just enjoy this ""MASTERPIECE"" while waiting for GTA 6."
Cracked at this game. But I accidentally lost time of track and now my fish is dead. But good news is I'm now rank 90
- Bought GTA V - Got into a fist fight - Stole a car - Robbed a gas station - Shot a cop - Got into a chase and had to evade the police - Waited til they stopped looking for me - Went home - Played GTA V - It's fun

the greatest game of all the time
good...
"This port of the game really has trouble on PC especially with newer hardware (like RTX 3060 and I7-10) I have gone through a bunch of videos and websites explaining how to prevent the countless crashing I experienced, which unfortunately seems pretty common. I changed & updated everything that was talked about on the computer and in game. I even downloaded FPS optimization packs that are reported to help with the initialization error crashes. There were two types of crashes. Initialization errors that are tied to the graphics cards (reportedly) and full crashes without error that just sent me back to steam.   I powered my way through the campaign and lost track of the ""fixes"" that I had to do that were overall unsuccessful. I am now uninstalling the game and not touching it again. I find it frustrating and disappointing that such a popular game has such a bad PC port and that it is up to the community to try and fix and optimize the game. I mean Rockstar are the same people that charge $50 for a red dead 1 port when recent full remakes of games have been an average of $40. Why should I expect for them to manage one of their biggest sources of profit when the fans are doing it for them..."
Kaia 30 fps ro ar mqondes :d
dream game
this game reminds me of a long lost friend named Gannon
"Story Mode is good yes no problem and I have no issue loading anything there, everything is fast but in GTA online I have to waste plenty of time restarting and everything because it always gets stucked in a loading screen every now and then whenever you finish a mission or enter a garage/apartment"
Love GTA its been 10 Years and this game is still amazing
Do yourself a favor and wait if you are buying for Online. Hackers just run rampant and ruin it for everyone else. Rockstar seemingly refuses to do anything to stop them.

Bought the game in 2018. Usually I just downloaded 100% save file online and free roam destroying stuff. Started to play the story mode for the first time ever 2 weeks ago and managed to finish it today. It's so good. I've been missing out this masterpiece.

Verry Fun Should play
VERY GOOD bugs sometimes ruin it
ENOUGH MILKING GIVE US GTA VI
good game with extraordinary graphics
"Every time I play the GTA Online, I feel like 5 years are shaved off my lifespan"
"Fun game with a nice singleplayer story, online is good in a closed lobby with friends, public is full of cheaters and griefers, and since Rockstar mostly care about making loads of money, they'll just add cars that costs a lot."
"Great game, amazing storyline!  Like most games, it has its fair share of bugs, but I didn’t experience anything game-breaking. Definitely worth buying!"

"Rockstar games is a money hungry franchise, do not buy this game if you value your time."
I Like it.
"Absolute garbage. I've done basically everything to try to get this game running normally, to even launch but nothing happens. Stuck on a loading screen for literal days while nothing happens, this game is garbage and even Rockstar customer support cant figure out why the game wont launch for me. Don't install this game unless you want a useless piece of bloatware to take up space on your PC."
One of the greatest masterpiece ever created
is aight
"I've played the game before for around 300 hours on Epic but it glitched out so I had to create a new account on Steam. Either way the game is quite good, just the money making techniques are very tedious. That is if you want to make any actual money. (above 100k)"
This game is so entertaining really like it

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is nothing short of a gaming phenomenon, and it's easy to see why. Rockstar Games has crafted an open-world masterpiece that continues to captivate players worldwide. Here's why I can't stop praising this game:  First and foremost, the open-world of Los Santos is an absolute marvel. It's vast, diverse, and teeming with life. From the bustling streets of downtown to the serene beauty of Blaine County's wilderness, every inch of this world feels meticulously designed and alive. Whether you're driving like a maniac, flying high above the city, or exploring off the beaten path, there's always something exciting to discover.  The story is another highlight. With three playable protagonists, each with their own unique personality and motivations, GTA V offers a narrative experience unlike any other in the series. The characters are brilliantly written, and the voice acting is top-notch, bringing them to life in a way that makes you genuinely care about their fates. The heists, in particular, are thrilling and masterfully executed, providing some of the most memorable moments in gaming.  The freedom GTA V offers is staggering. You can choose to follow the main story, embark on countless side missions, or simply wreak havoc in the city. The variety of activities is mind-boggling, from adrenaline-pumping car chases to leisurely rounds of golf. The sense of immersion is unparalleled, thanks to the attention to detail in every aspect of the game.  Speaking of detail, the graphics are a testament to Rockstar's dedication to creating a visually stunning experience. Even years after its initial release, GTA V continues to impress with its realistic lighting, weather effects, and meticulously crafted environments. It's a game that looks and feels ahead of its time.  GTA Online adds even more longevity to this already massive game. The multiplayer mode allows you to create your own criminal empire, participate in heists with friends, and engage in a wide range of activities in the ever-expanding online world of Los Santos. The constant updates and additions from Rockstar keep the online experience fresh and exciting.  The soundtrack is legendary, featuring a diverse range of music across various radio stations. Whether you're into classic rock, hip-hop, or electronic beats, you'll find something that suits your taste, enhancing the atmosphere of the game.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a triumph of open-world game design, storytelling, and sheer fun. It's a game that continues to evolve and impress, even years after its release. If you haven't experienced the chaos, thrills, and adventure of Los Santos, there's no better time than now. Jump into this virtual playground, and get ready for a wild, unforgettable ride!"
it so fun
play this game if you want to meet good people and not good people

"Grand Theft Auto V? More like Grind Fest Auto V.  Okay, I'd be lying if I said I haven't been enjoying the new content that's been added since the last time I played GTA Online 5 years ago, but the sheer amount of grinding you have to do to buy anything due to everything being priced ridiculously high now is insane. Like, you need to have a ton of money before you can a buy a business so can make enough money to be able to afford to buy stuff. Also, no fun to be had in public lobbies as they're still plagued by griefers, so I've only been playing in invite only lobbies, essentially playing GTA Online as a single player game. If you're thinking about buying the game in 2023 and starting from rank 1 in Online, don't bother.   Obviously this is a review of GTA Online. I don't think anyone is buying GTA V for the single player story anymore."

"Hi,  I have a problem with my key activation, it says that it's allready in use. How is that possible?! Never changed the steam name, or email, nothing. I need an answer and better a solution.   Thanks."
GOD TEIR GAME
"REASONS WHY GTA V IS NOT FUN  NO 1: MANGOTHEORY Mangotheory is a bot that happens to join the lobby and ruin the experience for everyone. When it joins, the avatar stand still as if AFK with godmode (allowing it to be uninterrupted with re-spawning) and starts to promote their MONEY/XP and Unlock glitches in the public chat. they then promote their discord channel for you to join to acquire cheats. This has been confirmed to be a bot by many players I've spoken to in the chat.   NO 2: Real Cheaters Unlike Mangotheory (a bot), you can encounter many real people who have found a way to bring a cheat engine into the public lobbies. These players have many abilities to screw over the players in the game. Ability 1: Godmode  Godmode make the player impossible to kill, giving them the advantage to follow you around and kill your avatar anytime they feel like it, making it impossible to have fun with others who a trying to enjoy the game. Ability 2: Teleportation  Teleportation remove the need to chase down another player when trolling. Everytime I've tried to escape a cheater would just teleport right next to me and kill me. This Teleportation cheats is so bad that it even allows cheaters to enter a your apartment (in-game), meaning that even the safe zones aren't protected. Ability 3: Messing with your Avatar  I've only played this game for a short time but have already lost count of the amount of times my character has been killed out of the blue without any warning. Cheaters can essentially nuke a public lobby, killing all present players simultaneously, which would just lead to an argument in the chat. one time i ran into a cheater that made everyone in the lobby slowly levitate into the sky and then dropping us to our deaths and even after re-spawning you would go back to levitating forcing everyone to leave and join another lobby. Ability 4: Server Wide Kicking  When a cheater happen to get in an argument with an actual player, it always ends with the cheater kicking everyone from the public lobby and sending us to a solo lobby, which makes the player having to go through the hassle of joining another public lobby to interact with players again. Ability 5: Messing with level and money Within my first 10 minutes of playing GTA V Online i was learning all the basics of what i can do and how to do it (Tutorial). When i was given the chance to finally free roam the GTA V world and do as i please, my screen was filled with notifications saying I've collected 10/10 collectable/secrat cash. This gave my player $1M of in-game currency and my level jumped from 1-30 in an instant allowing me to unlock the achievement  ""reach rank 25"". When i had a look at the chat it was one cheater saying your welcome and then leaving the game after promoting where and how to get the hacks. This took away the fun for grinding for money and items if they were this easy to obtain with cheats.   NO 3: Public Lobbies When i bought GTA V i was expecting to run into a couple of bad apples or sweats who player the game seriously, mixed in with a couple of nice players who would make it fun. but in order to have any fun with the online aspect of GTA V you would have to either play with friends on in a crew only session or find any discord servers which promotes a private server to join without cheaters.  NO 4. Anti-Cheat This is my first time playing GTA V online and I've never experienced a game with a terrible anti-cheat system. Until  I see that Rockstar has introduced and implemented a functional anti-cheat system.  Thanks for your co-operation  Sab"

"Quick review: 5  ### Metric ### 1- Garbage. :( 2- Did not fulfill the purpose. 3 - Ok, fulfilled the purpose. 4 - A good game! 5 - Just play and be happy. :)"
"Game is fun until any form of modder comes on the server, modders are actual dog shit players who can't play the game correctly so they have to cheat just to beat you. And the best part is, is rockstar doesn't actually give a flying fuck about what happens online. Every time I report these little bitches and send hard evidence of them modding they don't do jack shit."
GTA Online is a delivery driving simulator with tons of hackers so don't play online! The real gold lies in the story mode. Story mode is the ideal way to play this game. :)
"GTA 5 is the new Skyrim   it'e been around for a decade and always lost reputation over the years  stop milking this game, it will never get better unless you re-add everything who was removed ( abbility to transfer money to other players, manual ragdoll, kill yourself anywhere you want ( removed because of try hards doing 1st person 180 su1cide to never die from a player ) ( re-add animals, colored online map like xbox 360/ps3 online used to have, etc. )   don't be like Bethesda....be like the FiveM community and actually put some love in it instead of greed        this final message goes for any company owner ( or future owner ) who read this   ""taking shortcuts always help financially....however, it's never as good as it used to be or could have been if it stayed in it's original form.........many disasters and company's fall come from taking shortcuts.....be wise in where you take those shortcuts...because sometimes, a better option is only a tiny bit harder to achieve but has a better outcome....stop thinking about your wallet first, think about whoever will fill it in return.....the merrier, the better.....the more your clients hate your work, the less they will invest and the more likely they will prevent potential customers from making purchases......in the end, a happy customer brings an other""   ""サイバーカニ　２０２３|||||Kani Cyber    ２０２３""       this game is overrated due to people's blindness.....i can't wait to see how the world runs in 20 years... too many are blind or ignorant.....many things have to change in order to have a better future together  いってらっしゃい、あなたの友達六十七匹の稲妻炎カニ     ( the first word means ""take care"" not welcome ( if you use google translate ))"
"Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V is a massive open-world action game that offers an incredible amount of freedom to explore the vast city of Los Santos and surrounding countryside. After its initial release in 2013, it still holds up well nearly a decade later as one of the most ambitious and entertaining open world games ever created.  GTA V allows you to play as three different protagonists - Michael, Franklin and Trevor. Each character has their own skillsets and special abilities, and you can switch between them at will. This gives you a lot of strategic options during missions and allows you to see the story from different perspectives.  The sprawling open world is packed with details that make Los Santos feel like a living, breathing city. There are countless vehicles to drive, stunt jumps to make, random events to discover and side activities like tennis, golf and scuba diving. The amount of content is almost overwhelming.  Missions provide plenty of over-the-top action, from large scale heists to street races and shootouts. Gunplay feels impactful and driving mechanics are smooth. Even mundane activities like customizing cars is enjoyable thanks to the level of depth and options.  With amazing writing, voice acting and character development, GTA V's story and satire of Southern California life is entertaining from start to finish. Though some themes and humor haven't aged perfectly, it's an engaging crime story fueled by greed and a memorable cast of characters.  GTA Online has kept the experience feeling fresh for years with new modes and content updates. It does have some repetitive grind, but playing and wreaking havoc with friends is a total blast.  Some gameplay and graphics elements feel a bit dated now, but GTA V remains one of the most impressive open world experiences out there. The incredible attention to detail paired with exciting action and dark humor makes this a crime saga not to be missed."

"Well, as a fan of GTA games, I can say that GTA V is a good game. But the game has four cons for me.    Firstly, I don't like the story of the game. The story of the game is so boring, unlike other GTA games.       Second con is about online. There are many toxic players. Of course many online games have some toxic players. If you want to earn some cash, to play normal, I recommend you to play in private session. And if you want to enjoy online, you need to have friends to play online with them. GTA Online missions are good, can say that better than the story missions.   Third con is about chatting system in online. Sometimes you can see your friend's chat, sometimes can't.    Fourth con is about online again. Well, there were some guns, cars in the game, but then Rockstar removed them from the game, that's why I think that older players have more advantage about that things which I mentioned.  Edit: Rockstar fixed third and fourth problems. Well done"
Gta Online is terrible DDOS is so prevalent but story is a 9/10
hehehehehehehe FUCK YOUUUU
"Love the story, no matter how many times I play it. Playing online is also amazing."
"скучно уныло однообразно, жаль"
Fix your fucking servers Rockstar. Hackers make it impossible to play
no money kkkkkkk
GTA 5 is a very good game but to much greifing.
"It is the 10 year reunion of this game and I know it has won the labor of love award here on steam but I feel an obligation to thank the game for its graphics, game-play, and comradeship I have gain with my 250 friends.  I have more that 2000 hours in game and more than what is charted here on steam.  Well worth the almost $30 for the game play alone.  Yes you start small with a small weapons selection but if you put the time in get to level 120ish all weapons become available.  Bravo Zulu to all the people who made this game into something that will last into at least 1 future generation, after absorbing 2 already!"
"The game is enjoyable and great for immersing yourself in a new world. I quite enjoy the driving side of the game as it is realistic in the sense of how the cars function, look, and crash. Not only that, both in the online mode and story mode there are endless missions to complete that will certainly occupy you for hours on end. I highly recommend this game to new players."
The best game I've ever played
Falar o que?? É GTA porr@! Aguardando o 6!

"got banned for typing n word, bad game"

"What I want when I press the play button of a game is to play the game, not install a useless launcher, spend time doing math on a stupid captcha six times in a row, and wait for an email wrote in Russian that takes minutes to arrive."

"Grand Theft Auto V is a real paragon of greatness in today's game world, in my opinion. Grand Theft Auto V is a singular illustration of the power of media. Los Santos' beautifully constructed metropolis exemplifies a stunning blend of creative genius and technical capability, offering players an awe-inspiring playground to explore and profoundly connect with. The beautifully knit narrative, distinguished by the depth and complexity of its characters, establishes a powerful emotional connection that lasts throughout the game experience.   [i]Grand Theft Auto V is nothing short of a masterpiece.[/i]"
it's awesome
games got so many glitches its kinda unreal
Nice boy.
waiting for GTA6
"Playing GTA 5 is like trying to plan a quiet, peaceful day at the beach with your in-game buddies, only to end up hijacking a jet ski, crashing it into a yacht, and making more enemies than friends. It's like life on the edge of chaos, where the most logical thing to do after robbing a bank is to go play some golf and practice your swing. Remember, in Los Santos, you're only one stolen ice cream truck away from becoming a criminal mastermind!"
Fantastic game - recomended!
The real La experience minus the smog
very fun game. I love just killing all the policec with the minigun 10/10.
"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is."
fun but gets annoying
"After a long time, decided I would like to install this game again, but when I start her up it say's that my Rock star account is blocked. So no more GTA V for me... And Rock Star customer service won't fix this.  #The_Future_of_ Gaming"
the black man has superpowers!
"I have come to conclude that my driving skills in any game uniformly suck. They suck even more when they are assigned specific scores for quests.  Aside from that, stealing cars in-game was extremely fun and I spent pretty much my entire initial playthrough (once released from the starter mission) hopping into random vehicles, zooming over all manner of terrain, and knocking over as many pedestrians as possible until the cops finally caught up and turned me into human Swiss cheese."

trying to trick geforce now    also good game
AMAZING GAME FOR A BIDGET RX 590 8GB VRAM AND 16GB OF RAM A
online is only fun if you have a menu and the story mode is really fun   also do not buy shark cards just pay some dude online to give you 10 billion for like 10 dollars if you really want to buy money
good just dont go to stript club
"<DX_Version value=""0"" />"
very yes game spent most of the time in the strip
"Top 3 game of all time. Rockstar takes longer than Playboi Carti to make us games, but they're worth it every single time. Open world story mode is magnificent and heists are rewarding and fun every time you do one. 11/10"
Game for one time when comes to single player...online garbage! Cheaters in all games this days I really hate that! Greedy company..made masterpiece like RDR2 (online not that good) and then back to bs!
"online is filled with hackers, prepare to get DDOS'd, rockstar just wants your money, dont do it"
waiting for GTA VI :)
"Do not play online.. play on fivem instead if you plan on playing online, rockstar doesn't care to add anti cheat even though it's the most known issue in their games that cheaters run freely and ruin everything  Singleplayer though? a sandbox open-world where your imagination of what chaos you can bring to the world is the limit? 8/10 and the story isn't too bad either.  i give the game a 6/10 mainly due to the base game online being in such a horrible state for so long with no effort to fix it from rockstar. Let's just hope gta 6 will have at minimum Easy Anti-cheat active..."
This game changed my life.
DOPE ALL THROUGH
game = cool

I would strongly recommend this game.

gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood gameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
I ran over many padestrians. 10 out of 10
"Bro Stop Already. I got the pre-order edition in 2013 and this game died at the introduction of flying vehicles. With over 8000 hours across 3 platforms I can confidently say this game is dead. Any online lobby is god mode hackers while innocent people get banned for in game currency. Sam & Dan Houser were the soul of this company and shortly after they left we all saw in front of our eyes their transformation into Rockisoft. We can all agree how underwhelming and outright lazy the RDR1 port was. Any good titles like RDR2 Online get shut down to focus on a 1/2 decade old dying game all in the name of $, good old R* milking their fans relentlessly. Hello Games & Facepunch are the some of the only major devs rn that actually care about their game and treat their players like playerss instead of money bags. Buying everyting in GTA Online costs about 900 Million ingame $ which is roughly $9000 USD or 2 YEARS of playtime.    TLDR:  * DEAD GAME * Rockisoft is not the same after losing Sam & Dan Houser. * Absolutely despise their fanbase and transformed into sellouts. (GTA SA ""remastered"", RDR2 Online) * Completely oblivious to Fanbase wants. (RDR1 ""port"", Bully 2, La Noire)  Do not reply its T2Interactive because as a lead of a $1B+ franchise team you do have some say."
"Needs no introduction, is fun."
Got bored only played for 2 hours
Love it. (Pls griefers releace my family)
"pretty good, except for the fact that the online part is full of exploiters"
GOOFY AHH GAME WITH HACKER AND TITS WWWWWWWWWW GAME FRFR ON MY MAMAS TOE
shot a taxi driver
"the steam version of this game is basic and is not as evolved as the console versions because everyone who does play mods and the normal game is still in the caveman days from what I have experienced the PS5 version of gta online has more to do custom glitched benny rims on any car,yankton plates,glitched paint colors,cartradeglitches,Modded vehicles you can put in your garage you normally cannot own all while having no mods this is all done in the normal gta online version tons more stuff to do on the consoel version of this game but the campaign was great everything done so well game runs smooth apartments,guns,jobs,heists,cars,clothes,insurance quite a bit to the game wish there was more to it the fivem launcher has really taken over the base game due to the base game being so limited on content not much has been added over the 10+ years but a couple mmos and a couple jobs looking forward to the new one"
its like they added a shitton of online missions without ever balancing them modders in every other server overall sh!t game
"I highly enjoy running pedestrians over in this game with my vehicle, then proceeding to go on a 5-star flee from the Law Enforcement Officers with a big smile on my face. My ""mental state"" stat in this video game is labelled as ""psychopath"" , which is not too far from myself in real life. I enjoy and feel connected this game. Would reccomend. :steamhappy:"
"Pretty solid, Large player base."
"I've had so much fun and met so many people while playing this game, not to mention all of the content there is, its practically endless. If any new player read this and decide to get the game I have a few tips, don't buy a low-mid end apartment, buy a high end one, but don't get expensive ones. You can get one for 200k which might seem like a lot, but you can make that back from the original heists. Also buy the diamond casino membership in-game, it allows you to spin a wheel every 24 hours and get a prize, whether that be money, Xp, or a car. In total Ive had so much fun in this game and will continue to play it untill gta 6 comes out (around march-april 2024)"
shoot people and hit civilians in cars for four hours simulator
It's fun!
straight up jorking it at the stripe club and by it i ment my pentis
"and then, if you think there is no way this can get any better... or worse - in this game - the radio plays and ... it is just one of the best games. :)"

"Absolutely wonderful game, story is still as wonderful and still as fun as it was in 2013 (2015 for PC Players). I still recommend even though its 10 years old. BUT ROCKSTAR STILL WAITING FOR GTA 6!!!!"
idk i just maxed out driving and i make a point to not kill ppl. driving simulator frfr 10/10
"Nobody reads reviews anyway, so I'll write that I'm gay"
good game not bad
very good withn mod menus
very easy to mod online its fun if you mod otherwize you broke all the time
it fun and a stress reliever
the GTA online experience can be boiled down to >do cayo perico with your friend >buy your own kosatka >do your own cayo perico >wife leaves you because you are spending more time doing cayo perico then with her >kids want no visitations >fall into a continuous spiral of depression  >kill yourself overall a pretty good experience
GRAND THEFT Ass
Very fun game its good how you can play 3 different characters!

"This, Is game, Game make fun. fun make game, bore of grind moneys. hacc, see eye pee aderesse on talking box. enjoy."
TRASH
best game ever i played
i only use this gme to beat it in the strip club
the amount of players hacking and abusing glitches is ridculous. literally more than half the public lobbies ive played in has had some idiot running around in god mode ruining the game for everyone. totally regret wasting money on this shit just to play online and end end up with this crap.
10/10 60fps max graphics
"Since Rockstar has made it impossible for me to get in touch with them privately. I'll post this on every public forum until they respond.  In regard to your previous e-mail  Dearest Rockstar Games,  I hope this email finds you well. This is a response to the pleasant email you sent me 2 days ago in regards to my suspension. Now this is not an appeal, this is not me begging to lift my suspension. This is going to be a me, an innocent bystander, flipping your entire organization from CEO Strauss Zelnick to the janitor whose name I hope is Joey, the biggest of middle fingers. I have not played GTA V since June 22nd, 2023, or the day they discovered the OceanGate Titan wreckage. Now I know the suspension is not from the sub-nautical nonsense I may have or may have not partaken in the day the wreckage was discovered, because that would just be silly now would it. I do not know the details as to why I have been suspended and my progress reset, for at this portion of our debacle is an unknown allegation. During a brief investigation into what could possibly warrant my suspension, unless my account was hacked, there is no need for the suspension. I do not believe my suspension is just and warranted for outside tomfoolery. This may come as a shock to you, but as I investigate these bold allegations, I will be placing you on an unpaid indefinite suspension from my valuable time. I also regret to inform you that this a final decision and cannot be appealed. I will also tell 2 friends of how poorly you handled this situation. They will in turn tell 2 friend who each will tell 2 friends. If that chain continues, it will be a very bad and sad look for Rockstar games. I hope that this misunderstanding can be handled like gentlemen/ladies/they/them.  Respectfully, Eric G. Taylor the 1st"
just get it .
Saddest 10th birthday celebration :(
Awsome GAME
"Really? An event for the 10th annivers- wait, 10th?! 10 years this game has been milked, now, I'll say they did make Red Dead Redemption 2 (an absolute masterpiece in my opinion), but weapon skins for 2 guns people never use and the rpg, plus 3 outfits and at most like $30k in ammo, armor, and snacks.  Recently I've been playing GTA IV, and while it feels slightly dated with some mission designs, it just feels built to last better than this multi-billion dollar buncha garbage. If I were to give my suggestion? Don't get this game again, even if you want to play it. Take it from a person who has less than half a thousand hours, the most fun you'll have about GTA V is watching people play it, not doing so yourself. R* doesn't need you to buy more GTA V milk, so don't."
why dont just u ban all the hacker?????? not only fix bug
old but gold

This is the best Story and Online game man to know.
the best game so far
"Everything about this game has been said. It is a milestone in gaming history and set such a high bar for open world games that still can't quite be reached by a lot of other studios.  But I will never forget what Rockstar is doing with their online mode. They are here to get every single cent out of you, no matter what."
Great game in terms of story and quality
its one of the best game

"Amazing singleplayer experience with an awesome open world, the best driving in any game I've played to the point where I drive and listen to music just for fun without doing anything else for hours, and the online is a mixed bag that using the right methods and sometimes with a friend or two, is still extremely fun despite the grind  (or because of the grind if you like that like I do.  Solid 8/10 game, one of my favs"
Wow such a nice game! :3 The anti cheat for this game is phenomenal and the community is so good! they give you compliments in the chat and they are real race enthusiasts! when you load in you can guarantee there will be at least 2 administrators in god mode in every session!
cloud sync disconnects way to much and it takes forever to load into a online server even with fast 5g wifi
it was perfect...perfect down to every last minute detail.
6  v 2
this GAME IS SOO FUN
if you mod your single player its fun
GTA VI will come in the year 5794
"GTA Online is worst experience ever. The game is full of cheaters who can do whatever they want to you: take your weapons, money, surround you with invisible walls, kill you right at spawn and much more. There are so many cheaters that it seems that the developers don’t fight them at all. The game has been unplayable for a long time and it looks like there won't be any improvements.  P.S. Single-player is great."
FIRST 5 MIN OF PLAYING SOMEONE TOLD ME MY ADDRESS AND CALLED ME THE N WORD !0/10 RECOMMENDED
"wellll what to say about this game. A game that's one of the most sold of all time, been here for 8 years. You get to be a drug / mafia / hitman / armsman / whatever df there is in USA. Id say its decent.   no its really fun, you should get it"
release gta 6 fr
"10 sessions with cheaters out of 10, thanks for the good attitude towards the community. But you have to admit, it's one of the best games of all time"

"been playing on console since 2018 now i started doing gang wars in private servers with my brother 10/10 game, cant wait for gta 6"
"GTA V Review  Review is after completing the main story missions, all side missions, finding all collectibles, clearing the entire map and achieving 100% completion on single player mode. As a side note: never cared for multiplayer. [hr][/hr]   [b]Story[/b] My favorite GTA game was San Andreas. After playing this game, my favorite GTA game is San Andreas. Yes, that didn’t change. It’s hard to compete against Carl Johnson’s version of the hero's journey. Having said that GTA V is an absolute gem in a caliber of its own. A diamond of a game. I highly encourage gamers to 100% the single player aspect of the game. As you explore the game to find all collectibles you will see just how much detail developers integrated into this world. Also Space Docker is the ultimate vehicle in the game!   [b]Gameplay[/b] Took me a while to figure out how to do the knife flights correctly for the achievement. Other than that, the remainder of the gameplay was superb. I was; however, jealous of all the cool vehicles and weapons the developer implemented in GTA Online.   [b]Graphics[/b] On a league of their own considering how detailed the world is. The only benchmark they need to surpass for the next game is their own.   [b]Controls[/b] Played on PC with mouse and keyboard. Gameplay and gunplay was smooth and responsive.    [b]Side Missions[/b] Completed all of them. I had to, you see, because they were all so good.   [b]Music/Soundtrack/Voice[/b] Excellent curated selection of songs as usual. Voice acting from all 3 main characters was at peak quality.   [b]Performance[/b] Experienced no crashes and the game ran smoothly on my PC (which is a mid-range PC). It did not cause undue heating of the CPU and GPU.   How in the world is Rockstar going to surpass this game? Yes I know they did Red Dead Redemption 2 afterwards, but that game did not have as many moving parts as this game did.  Overall Score 10/10"
"good but modders made the experience hell by kicking me from sessions, crashing my game multiple times, griefing an annoyoing me..."
gta is gud
It's not safe to play this game online. You risk exposing your IP and other information to attackers.
"Like: Mods Compatibility on Offline Mode (Need OpenIV), Good Story Mission (sometime isn't), Open world, Compatible with FiveM. Dislike: Cheating on Online Mode Still Roaming in Online Session."
its gives us freedon in this world
All GTA games are awesome. 10/10
its fun just like your mom
I played this game for 5-6 years (i have played on another accounts) but this year is at it's lowest. It has many hackers/cheaters whenever i join i have a lot of bugs or it just crashes out even tho my graphics card and cpu are doing well. Rockstar... do something. Peace
10 YEARS LATER AND STILL ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER CREATED

"Why did I move here? I guess it was the weather. Or the... Ah, I don't know, that thing. That magic. You see it in the movies. I wanted to retire. From what I was doing, you know? From that, that... line of work. Be a good guy for once, a family man. So, I bought a big house. Came here, put my feet up, and thought I'd be a dad like all the other dads. My kids, would be like the kids on TV, we play ball and sit in the sun... But well, you know how it is."
"I'd say this is the best story line in the GTA series yet, although the game is nearing 10 years old it still looks and feels great to play. I'm currently replaying through the story mode again"
shit goes hard
too many bugs.. not a good game to play...
"""You tell me exactly what you want, and I will very carefully explain to you why it cannot be."""
"Bu oyunu konsolda oynadım, klavyede kontrolcüye göre çok daha kolay olduğunu söyleyebilirim :3"
"Cash, drugs, heist and bitches, what else would you want?"
its really boring after you complete the story mode and online mode is more boring we need roleplay servers they are pretty interesting

i played this game for several times but the game is crashing too many times AND graphics are too low
I like It but it's kinda of overpriced for 2013 game I know what is the grand theft auto series

"Grand Theft Auto V remains a gaming pinnacle. Its meticulously crafted world of Los Santos, intertwined narrative of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, and seamless character switch mechanic deliver an unforgettable experience. The wealth of activities, from high-stakes heists to chaotic police chases, ensures constant excitement. The addition of Grand Theft Auto Online extends the adventure, offering a thriving multiplayer playground. Mature themes warrant discretion. In short, GTA V is a masterpiece that defines open-world gaming."

At first I played GTA V it was fun the first couple of hours and after that it got repetitive.   I used to want to play that gta v game when I was a kid but i'm over it now considering I can't be bothered to play it through because it got repetitive and less fun. GTA like games nah I don't like those kind of games anymore.
this one of the best game i ever played

"Been playing GTA V pretty much since it came out on the 360. i literally just started over on PC with all new Online character and everything. Unfortunately it didn't take me very long to discover that hackers are still around and worse than ever. About 15 minutes ago (before writing this) someone decided to hack my online character and forced my progress up for rank 9 to rank 30, gave me a boat load of money, and then forced all the unlocks for me. now i am afraid i cant play AT ALL without being banned, i didn't consent to any of that and now my game is ruined. I didn't do anything wrong and yet now I'm the one that gets screwed. I managed to contact support but all they gave me was some bs about ""routine sweeps"" for hackers and suspicious game play. I have no idea how long that is going to take, or if their ""sweep"" is actually gonna fix my character or just take the false money."

"The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start."
Singleplayer is great. Stay away from online though.

awsome thats all i have to say
that game is my life  highly recemended
"A Wonderful, Amazing Game......for adults only of course lol!!!!"
I haven't played this game long enough to be able to actually give this game a review so i gave it a thumbs up for now and ill update later when i put more time into it.  so far my experience is going great.  if you want to go play GTA online make sure you avoid public lobbies and stay with private invite only lobbies so you don't get modders harassing you. and be sure to have a friend to play with.   Story mode?  this game has a story mode? nah ill stay with GTA online.

"Amazing game even for being an older one still never gets old. Just starting online play and its pretty awesome as well, even if you dont want to play with other people you can get on your own server and try it solo!!"

A classic.
fucking trash
tuff hood times be relatable yeard
fantastic game. plenty of stuff to do. beautiful world. just a great game
i installed 100 mods and now thanos just got shot in the face by elon musk
It's good cause I said so.
Teaches extremely valuable life lessons. 9/10  The 1/10 missing is because it turns my PC into a radiator without my consent.
This game is an open map game and it it very fun u can either play as a heist crew and play out their lives or u can make your own charecter and play out hias live with or against other players (recomend for ages 11 and up)
killing people is so much fun!!!!
hjk
this game is realistic no its not
"single player story is on par for a rockstar game, great diverse open world with diversity and lots of interesting characters to meet. its not life changing by any means, but the modding community keeps it real.  don't recommend multiplayer, rockstar has once again proven they have no expertise in netcoding, security, or ingenuity as the multiplayer world is filled with hackers, exploiters, and severe lag in any server you end up in. you can pick up trainers and modpanels for this game off pretty much any website rendering the leveling system, money system, stock market, missions, races, and more pointless."
too many hacker
I LOVE IT I HIJACKED A PLANE
It's alright.
"Very easy to get banned in online, but overall very great game"
very gooooooood
Highly recommended especially online mode.
Game GUD
I like this game a lot but buy it on some sale :)

whens gta 6 coming ha?
lambat online babiiii
"Rating: ★★★★★  I've had the immense pleasure of diving into the world of Grand Theft Auto V for the past five months, and I can confidently say that this game is nothing short of a modern gaming masterpiece. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this open-world epic, delivering an experience that sets the bar for open-world action-adventure games.  Graphics and Visuals (★★★★★): From the moment I stepped into the fictional city of Los Santos, I was awestruck by its breathtaking visuals. The attention to detail is astonishing, with stunningly realistic character models, lifelike environments, and a day-night cycle that adds depth and immersion to the world. Even after months of gameplay, I still find myself stopping to admire the sunrise over the city or the reflections in the rain-soaked streets.  Gameplay and Mechanics (★★★★★): GTA V seamlessly blends a gripping narrative with an open-world playground that encourages exploration and experimentation. The three playable protagonists, Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, each bring their unique personalities and skills to the table, making for a diverse and dynamic gameplay experience. The controls are intuitive, and the variety of vehicles, weapons, and activities at your disposal ensures that boredom is a foreign concept in this game.  Storyline and Characters (★★★★★): The narrative in GTA V is an absolute triumph. It's not just a crime caper; it's a thought-provoking exploration of the American Dream, ambition, and morality. The three protagonists' intertwined stories provide a refreshing perspective on the criminal underworld, and the supporting cast of characters is as memorable as they are unpredictable. The sharp writing and superb voice acting elevate the storytelling to new heights.  Multiplayer (★★★★★): Grand Theft Auto Online adds another layer of enjoyment to the game. Whether you're racing with friends, tackling heists, or simply causing mayhem in the vast open world, the multiplayer mode extends the game's longevity indefinitely. Frequent updates and a thriving online community ensure that there's always something new to discover.  Conclusion: Grand Theft Auto V is an enduring gem in the world of video games. Five months into my journey, I'm still finding new things to do, new secrets to uncover, and new ways to be amazed by the sheer scale and detail of Los Santos. This game represents a high watermark for the industry and is a must-play for any gamer. Rockstar Games' commitment to quality is evident in every pixel, and the result is nothing short of breathtaking. Five months in, and I can confidently say that GTA V is the best game I've ever played. If you haven't experienced it yet, do yourself a favor and dive into this open-world masterpiece. You won't be disappointed."
Wtf
i have never played the story but i like how the police are unable to look upwards when i am sat there directly above their police car with 5 stars
"The game is good but launching the online mode is pretty bad, i waste 30 mins and cannot enter the online mode. Also quick joining Heist keep throwing me out of the game"
fun game you get to buy shoes and powder
fortnit
nice game thats all i gotta say
rockstar fails
"For the solo, yes. For the multiplayer... heh, maybe with 1-3friends, in private sessions and heists, but thats it."

Now that the bulk of the online play experience isn't exclusively getting griefed by coked up teenagers on jetbikes.. yes. Good game.

I didn't go to prom. I played this game instead.

Nah I just use this game for FiveM and LSPDFR. Grand Theft Auto 5 sucks by itself.
gorillaz on the radio???
"this game is absolutely, amazing although i didn't the part yk, but anyways its a bit fun but can get boring easily i've caused destruction around michaels house n the club yk lmao, but nonetheless good game i've had 14+ hours on this game already although its a bit pricey costing around 15 cdn to 26 cdn, depending if there's a sale or not, overall 10/10."
hehe. hitting pedestrians is fun.
so fun with friends 5/5
very fun :)
"side note : i've played this game since launch, on & off on PS, always been a fan. i recently built a new pc and wanted to see how GTA 5 was on M & K.. game is just as great as it is/was compared to my play time on console, although it is quite easy to get burned out on quickly, due to game-play, missions or otherwise... it'll always be a good addition to your library, especially if you have some time to kill and just wanna bs.  RECOMMENDATION : in my 10 hours of play time on PC I've noticed that pretty much every session is filled with someone modding... as well as for EVERY single free-mode session I've joined, there WILL always be a modder  that joins session and spams the super loud explosion BS, for which someone kicks them, only for them to re-join and do the same repetitive BS time and time again or; another will join under a diff name and so same thing.  most amount of koins and kicks ive seen in my 10 hours, was 13 joiners in 30 mins (causing loud jump scares) and getting kicked within 10-20 secs   it almost seems like you need to run a mod menu just to deter the BS other people with the menus pull, which is obnoxiously ignorant. which honestly just adds to the burnout factor.. so far I've just stuck to playing missions once the super loud jump scares start or playing something else entirely..  great job, R*"
THIS ISN'T GTA 8
"when i first got the game i read the reviews and a wise man said ""i just punched a women for the first time... it felt good"" i can confurm this is true"
this game will out live me at this point
fun game need to try if you are a fan of rockstar games
byuh
"Grand Theft Auto V is the most realistic life simulator I've ever played. Forget about those boring ""sims"" games where you make friends, build houses, and go to work. In GTA V, you can do it all – and then some!  Pros:  Excellent traffic AI: NPCs drive as if they're on a mission to reenact every action movie car chase. Realistic economics: Who knew a life of crime could be so profitable? Just don't ask me how I got that yacht. Endless entertainment: From playing golf to parachuting off Mount Chiliad, there's something for everyone. ""Trevor Philips Industries"" – the only workplace that never gets old. Cons:  Terrible road rage: It's hard to maintain my zen-like calm when my fellow motorists are trying to recreate the next Fast & Furious movie on the freeway. Clothes shopping addiction: My character spends more on clothes than I do in real life, and I'm not even mad about it. Overall, if you've ever wondered what it's like to be a stunt driver, a skydiving pro, a billionaire playboy, or a criminal mastermind, this game has got you covered. Just be prepared to lose track of time and your moral compass. I've been a criminal, but I've never been so law-abiding in my life – in a video game, of course!  Remember, it's all in good fun, and the virtual world of GTA V is a riot. Just try not to get too carried away, or you might find yourself on the wrong side of the law in real life too!"
good performance
bro i have spent 1.5 hours just trying to get in the game but it says my code is already being used
game is good but the one flaw i have is that when i got the premium version of gtav i also got the Criminal Enterprise pack DLC where i should have gotten a lot of stuff but i didnt it doesnt say that i own it in game and when i go to it in game it says buy but if i go to the steam store page it says that i have it in my library. So in other words rockstar scamed me out of my starter pack and i dont know how to fix the issue/problem. If anyone knows a solution lmk in the reply's.  Have a Great day  -GhostWo1f
almost ten year old game and yet still runs like dog dookie on fast gaming pc
my account got hacked then i got it back and i randomly got banned for 30  days and account reset after 800 hours i wouldent suggest this game for some low life rockstar people to ban your account no reason after i just got it back wouldent suggest playing unless you want to get banned randomly they should be more worried about modders
the is fun
i like everything about gta v it  is a very fun game
"there are stupid hackers in every lobby and not the fun ones and they ruin the game, I cannot finish a mission ONCE BECAUSE OF THEM. Come out with gta6 plz this is cringe"
this game sucks big booty donkey balls
I just beat the game for the first time. absolutely stunning story. I do recommend buying this game although I can't help but feel like the story was a bit short.
where is gta 6 ?
besst
"Great game, Wish 6 was out :("

FR ONG THIS GOOD JUST NO ONLINE CROSSPLATFORM
this is one of the best games to play

dis is good. you like to pretend it is fun.
"I'm an Italian gamer and this review was written entirely with Google Translate. I would like to start this review by saying that despite the one star review I love Rockstar products and above all I love GTA V, I have all of Benny's custom cars and 40 other vehicles, I have never had any problems and in fact I have also made purchases to go forward and I don't want to cheat, but I have to say I feel cheated about something that happened. I switch from PS4 to PC and buy GTA, I try to recover the account but I can't and after two days I search on Google and find it written that it cannot be done, which I find absurd given the possibility of cross play. I don't demand a refund but I do demand that a game like GTA V has the ability to transfer accounts from PS4 to PC. I know maybe my review won't mean much to you but I hope you will read it and give a fan the chance to play their favorite game on PC"
penis lol
its gta bruh
Rockstar games has some flaws but this is a certified hood classic

wheri good

"U want to play online huh? take my advice, play only on ""INVITE ONLY SESSIONS"". NEVER, i repeat NEVER play on PUBLIC Sessions. i tell u why. first of all, there will be GRIEVERS and MODDERS, they will be your new friends. they could be the reason you wont enjoy the online game at all. second, ROCKSTAR SERVER/MATCHMAKING is the worst like server of all time. Imagine that you stuck for HOURS in loading screen waiting to get into PUBLIC LOBBY. i literally had like 100 hours of loading screen instead of game time. So, do me a favor. start the game in offline mode first, then join the online mode in INVITE ONLY SESSIONS. Goodluck!"
RED DEAD IS BETTER
Nothing to complain about here 10/10
this game is very cool:)

You can do pretty much anything in online mode, you can be a drug lord, rob the same casino everyday, open nightclubs, open a company, pretty much everything.   9.5/10  Strongly recommend buying the game."

i love playing this game but its a liitle bit hard to figure out how to start(for me) basicly just do the letters in your map which are missions or heists and then just do whatever
The game is great except that it's flooded with kids using mods to grief people.

"RockStar Social Club is criminal.  Stop doing this for the single player experience.  I get it for multiplayer and the like.  But your spyware programs are annoying.  Coming back to play after years of inactivity to have a little fun and the game is unplayable until solving riddles of password protections and linking accounts to play a little quiet game.  After years of online and connective play this billion dollar industry have not figured a better system for ad revenues and generating commercial aspects in a user friendly way. Gamers could never come up with boycott big enough to trash these companies because the game design is excellent and the gameplay is fun, but I certainly wish there would be a proactive effort by these AAA studios in delivering a solution to these grand marketing schemes. So I will instead, waste my efforts in this ridiculous post as if screaming at a hurricane.  Time that I could have been playing your most excellent game is now put off for the several days that I must wait for a little email so I can attempt a password reset for something I set years ago.  For those people currently promoting your damn Social Club I hope your life allows that you feel sorry for your actions and the shame of this might drive you towards a change in behavior.    For those still reading this stupid post I hope you find some purpose in life that avoids these machinations that pound us slowly into the deep void of reality."

Are You Ready For GTA 6
Online has way too many bugs. Good game though
"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."
W GAME ON TOP
"Not able to log into the spyware that is Rockstar Social using my credentials, so I'm prevented from even starting the game. Adding insult to injury, when trying to log into Rockstar's web to see what's going on... to change my password or anything, I'm required to solve... Extremely!!! irritating and time consuming verification puzzles in which I'm required to sum in my head several (hard to see) dice up to 14, mixing both dots and numerals, and choose the correct picture among many others which total 13 or 15 each. Just imagine yourself counting six groups of dice succesfully, like this... not once or twice, but ten times, spending minutes and minutes on the task, only to either find out you made a mistake so you have to start all over, or see that nothing happens and you still can't restore the account or access the game. They're purposely showing customers the middle finger, clearly the entire company hate our guts.  It is unbelievable. If I could start a single player session, at least, for a game which I paid for and I own! But not even that. This game and the company sucks!!! Really, sucks!!! Rockstar is scamming the customers and the least they could do is to give a refund. With Rockstar -NEVER- again!"
this game has an oddly consistent way of crashing when alt tabbing near a cargobob. 10/10
"This has got to be the most sucked off game ever. There is no reason this game should be as popular as it is. Almost everything about this game is bad. The controls are so confusing is makes you feel like a toddler who has just been told to pilot an F22 raptor. Like why the fuck would middle mouse button open the menu. The loading time is so unreasonably long is makes you wonder if they just make it load for that long to mess with their players. The game play is mid at best, like there are so many other options for games you could play with the same if not better features. And one of the main selling points of the game, the heists, are utter filth found from the deepest depths of the filthiest dump. You spend 45 minutes setting it up just only for one civilian to catch a stray and make you lose all your progress and end up making $20. The game also takes up a whopping 100 gigabytes and, as expected for the size, takes forever yo re install. It is also so poorly optimized on steam, you have to make a social club account and if you forget that password then it's just over for you I guess because the password resetting website crashed every time you enter a new password. Only after you do some stupid extra thing you shouldn't have to do you can then reset your password. And don't even get me started on how hard it is to make money. you feel like you are making good progress and then you realize that the cheapest non shit car is over 1 million dollars. plus, for some vehicles, you need special garages to even buy some of the better things. Ever wonder why this game goes on sale for so cheap. The only reason I play this game is because my dumb ass friends keep asking me to play it. I would much rather do unpaid work than play this game. For anyone who is considering buying this game who hasn't gotten it yet and for those who are considering re installing it, don't."
W game lmao
"N tenho nem palavras para descrever o qual incrível esse jogo é, acho q a experiência fala por si só."
Best car in this game is or the rolls royce or the land rover in all black

Really nice realistic game. Do recommend buying and not waiting till it's free. (It will  never become free) Overall 5 stars.

very good but need uppdate

GOOD GAME allot of m0dderrs tho
"It just comes to show how well this game has been developed. The story mode, online mode are phenomenal. I highly recommend this game for anyone who is interested into role playing open world games. Although it is a +18 game, it still is a good buy for the selected audience."

my online game is stuked and not working

"It is one of the best games I have played, and highly recommended for players who seek relaxed gameplay with friends. However, there are some bugs that Rock Star has to improve."

"GTA story mode is good, but online is trash ngl"
"story is the only thing you can enjoy on this once great game, its riddled with vile modders an d hackers that can and will grab your ip and can and will boot you from the lobby. report them then right? wrong the anticheat doesnt even detect the cheats in the first place.  they can and are not limited too, caging you like an animal, spawn killing you, becming god mode and unkillable, try to kick them? you get kicked imagine that! oh and youd think rockstar would care, right? wrong they do nothing and even better they removed 97% of their anticheat and havent been bothered to patch anything. it feels like a broken beta with EA at the healm but this time its the pathetic humans working for rockstar and take two interactive. SAVE YOUR MONEY PLEASE this game is not worth even a 67% off (20$ gta) this level of bullshit. excuse my language but damn this game is awful, and new players just never come back and YOU CANT BLAME THEM"
itsa good one
the game is pretty cool but it will be cooler if they added nukes to the game
server of rockstar is shit
"There's a modder on nearly every server. Other than that, it's a great game."
because no one reads deez im going to say that im gay
"so good, so nice. like it."
"So I waited for almost ten years, never played or watched, denying this part of grand theft auto, thinking that it’s worse than IV, just to come to this very moment and say it was right thing to do, it’s that poor. In every aspect perhaps except satire. I quickly got tired of constant raised voice shoutings, this mid-life crisis drama sucked out of thumb, idiotic unstable characters, total cringe, annoying npcs and cops, pseudo gangsta shi*t, lame choice of music, boring ? sign missions, limit of actions in the world, clumsiness of character and vehicles, zero guns feeling, lame sound design, money grinding, narco missions - ahahah look he’s high, we should get high too and play G T A yeaaaaah, and i’m not saying anything about online mode. Fu*k that sh*t. Fourth part is much better than this LA blunt disaster. Also it was absolutely brain dead decision to put Johnny from the Lost and Damned on the sacrifice altar in order to show me truly emotional and troubled side of proto hipster."
"The game is perfect! It is a masterpiece of a open world design. The only problem is the time you have to wait to play the game. Sometimes I spend 15min just sitting and waiting while the game loaded. Each time when I want to play I think twice if I have enough time to wait. I read topics on forum and revealed that it is a common problem, and Rockstar don't want to fix it. Today I waited again for 15 mins looking at a rolling wheel, and just closed the game without playing it. It is sad."

I am looking for some free steam points so I can afford a mini background profile thanks !
"It's not really my thing anymore, but if senseless mayhem is your thing, then I do recommend it."
dont like it
for the past 3 days i have been playing all night long
if you want a good story then yes download. if u want 30 year old dudes that probably like children to come and bomb u endelessly with their pay to win account then yes download
"Really nice game to satisfy your lowkey psychopathic tendencies.... uhm, i mean i think it reduces IRL violence amongst men i guess  Would recommend to anyone, especially those thinking about doing criminal activity... go vent it all out in-game my friend it really helps :)  Cant wait for GTA 6"
very good game for when you are bored
nai hubutu
killing people
"Can't unlink my steam account to make a new one. Got hacked, really poor system they got going on here"
The story is amazing
"Grand theft auto V as the represent of the '9th art’ is the production which combined all techniques and inspirations of Rockstar therefore to be this greatness. It's like a milestone for not only Rockstar but the whole game industry. Characters in game have abundant personalities and they're also really stereoscopic as game characters that they can actually affect players to lead them to make unusual choices when it comes to determination times in games. As IGN gave this game the 10/10 back to 2018, I would like to say even in the 2023, Grand theft auto V still deserves a full-scores, epoch making masterpiece."
Nice game but  online is hard with bad guys
Haha stolen car go BRRRRRRR
"The game suffered from a real stagnation over all those pvp horrible mechanics, futuristic vehicles being added and much much more. Now it got way better on grinding and it would be great if it wasn't for the cheaters and modders. Not that I'm against on adding money to your account or messing around with friends or even randoms but we all know that most of modders only grief and destroy other people's cargo. Imagine grinding or waiting for a full bunker and watching it all being destroyed by a modder who just orb'd everyone in the lobby. If you bought the supplies you just lost $300k but if you grinded for supply missions you just lost 3 hours of your time playing the game. I'm not saying that you couldn't have known the risk of selling in public lobbies but at this point you are always griefed by modders and if you don't sell in public not only you are losing profit that allows you to buy more stuff and enjoy the game but also you'll find yourself playing all alone as if it was singleplayer with more content.   This game ask players to cheat because no one will grind all their lifes to get an Opel Corsa or even spend 1500€ just to buy everything they want and not worry about grinding. I would grind if it wasn't for modders and I prefere the pc version just for the option of playing with more than 60 fps and with mouse and keyboard.  If you will ban players at least ban the ones messing up with your game everyday just griefing and killing everyone. It's not even a legitimate tactic to grief it's against the rules!   Part 2:  The latest DLC is the worst so far. Took out more content that it added.  The missions are basic except for ""On Parade"" which gave me a cool challenge actually. There's no story at all, we don't have any cutscenes and the side characters only speak to us on the missions, we never see Charlie at all.  I would actually pay at least 5€ just to play a good DLC or 15€ for all the things half priced. Instead you just make players to pay 6-8 Million dollars to buy an avenger or 1.5M just for the upgrade and what do you get? 350k. Come on."
its verzy good
see for yourself and just request a refund when you realize the mistake you made. Make sure to do it before the 2hour window is up.
The Club be wild these days one hand gaming go crazy  10/10
My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on gta5 and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.
best game works great with lspdfr
What a game !!!
I think This Game Isa FANTASTIC!!!
"Title: Grand Theft Auto V - An Epic Experience Marred by Load Times, Cheaters, and Glitches  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is undoubtedly a modern gaming masterpiece that delivers an exhilarating open-world experience like no other. From the sprawling city of Los Santos to the captivating narratives of its three protagonists, this game is an action-packed adventure that has set a new standard in the gaming industry. However, amidst the praise, there are some significant drawbacks that need addressing.  First and foremost, GTA V's open-world is an absolute triumph. The attention to detail in recreating Los Angeles is awe-inspiring, and the sheer size of the map is mind-boggling. Exploring this virtual world is a true joy, with an abundance of side activities, missions, and random encounters that keep players engaged for hours on end.  The characters are brilliantly written and performed, with Michael, Franklin, and Trevor each bringing their unique charm and complexity to the story. The narrative is a rollercoaster ride filled with memorable moments and unexpected twists, making it one of the best in the series.  The game's visuals are stunning, especially on more powerful hardware. The attention to detail in the environment, character models, and vehicle designs is nothing short of remarkable. The soundtrack perfectly complements the atmosphere, featuring an eclectic mix of music that suits every mood.  However, the experience takes a hit when it comes to load times. It's baffling that even on high-end systems, players often find themselves staring at loading screens for what feels like an eternity. This issue disrupts the otherwise immersive experience and can be incredibly frustrating, especially when transitioning between story missions and online play.  Speaking of online play, GTA Online has its share of problems. The presence of cheaters and hackers in online lobbies has plagued the game since its inception. It's disheartening to see players exploit the game's mechanics to gain an unfair advantage, ruining the experience for others. Rockstar's efforts to combat these issues have been inconsistent at best, leaving legitimate players to suffer the consequences.  Furthermore, frequent glitches and bugs continue to mar the GTA V experience. These can range from minor inconveniences like mission markers disappearing to game-breaking issues that force players to restart missions or even the entire game. It's frustrating to encounter these problems in a game that has been on the market for years and has received numerous updates.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains a gaming masterpiece that deserves praise for its open-world design, storytelling, and attention to detail. However, the long load times, persistent issues with cheaters in online lobbies, and frequent glitches detract from what could be a flawless experience. While it's certainly worth playing for its strengths, it's disheartening to see these issues persist in a game of such high caliber. Rockstar Games should prioritize addressing these concerns to ensure that GTA V continues to shine as one of the greatest open-world games of all time."
Social club account comprised by Chinese hackers. Rockstar support wouldn't assist me with recovering the account.

Great game But fuck the hackers
great game other gta games are as good as this why not make some more/from tony/thanks for making this great game keep it up rockstar!

franklin the goat
ITS JUST ONE OF THOSE GAMES THAT ARE GOOD. NO PROBLEMS WITH IT
goated ah game
LENGEN GAME
pleaasssss fixed bugs
"Had my online character corrupted by a modder, 400+ hours gone. Would not recommend playing online, its not a fun experience. Story mode is pretty good though."
absolutely decimated my schlong when i went into one of those strip clubs
cool And fun
best game ever?
such a good game fr tho this shit fire asf
the game been out for 10ys but i till love it
"It's an overall very good game. BUT, the one thing that I did not appreciate about it was how dumb the NPC's are. I rate this game 9.5/10"
this is epic
best game fvckin ever
everything about it is good on my pc
"It's GTA5, what more can I say?  10 years and 185,000,000 copies later it's still the same good game. The story is phenomenal with a rich and diverse locale. As much as I can praise this I would not recommend the online version, it's something.  Go and buy it, it's a blast."
No explanation needed. Lol
its bit laggy for gaming pc you need atlist 4gb graphic card
this is so fire
gdsagd
"This is a really fun game the only problem with online is that it becomes a bit too grindy and repetitive, but other than that its really fun and the end game there's a lot of possibilities."
alr but play modded
sve najjj
this game is  cool.
i need gta 6
I LOVE LOOKING AT VIDEO GAME TITS
favourite game same with postal 2 i have 2 thousand hours on gta on my xbox w game
"Cuando lo compre le vicie bastantes horas al modo offline porque siempre me ha gustado su historia pero cuando entre al Online y empece a jugar me di cuenta de un problema muy serio que tiene el online: Tiene tantos elementos y misiones y cosas que en vez de ayudarte te terminan tirando demasiada información y terminas sin saber que hacer, sin dejar que lado que la mayoría de misiones no tienen lógica o son simplemente  extrañas. Yo le pondría de calificación un 8.0 porque aunque sea un buen juego termino volviéndose un limón que siguen exprimiendo para sacarle todo."
it goood game
Would recommend

The odds you see this review is millions to one.

"I'm fucking sick and tired of game producers introducing the artificial and unnecessary ""requirement"" of being always-online (in this case, the abysmal RSG launcher).  I've been playing their titles since GTA3 was still the latest entry (so literally for decades), but this crap is the last straw for me.  I put up with it before, for both GTAV and RDR2, but I'm done dealing with it for both.  I realize I ""only have to provide it once"" (unless *their* shit fucks up, of course), but I *shouldn't* have to provide it fucking ever.  They *know* I bought the fucking game; I got it on Steam FFS!  This shit is just unnecessary trouble for their own damn loyal customers.  So RSG can permanently fuck all the way off."
veri gud veri gud
Really good game!

"I wish there was a way to review the single player and multiplayer separately. The single player is missing lots of things that you expect from a modern title, mostly because the single player is about 10 years old at this point (literally 9 days away from a 10 year anniversary as I write this). But otherwise, the single player game is about everything you've come to expect from a great developer like Rockstar. The multiplayer game is about everything you expect from an absolutely scumbag horrible publisher like TakeTwo Interactive. The multiplayer is bugged as shit, has almost no incentive to play, filled with griefers and hackers (oh sorry, 'modders'), is 10 years old and TakeTwo have literally said they don't want you playing their game if you don't buy shark cards. I'm just going to go ahead and say: don't buy this game. Even for the single player, its a bit old and there are better single player games out these days (i.e. Witcher 3, Fallout, etc). The multiplayer is a horrendous piece of dog shit that is so obviously tacked on by TakeTwo as a way to try to milk this game for all the money they can get so they don't have to fund a new GTA game for as long as possible.  The real takeaway from GTA5 should really be that you should be extremely wary of GTA6. I'm sure Rockstar will do an absolutely amazing job on developing the game and the single player campaign, but TakeTwo is going to ruin it like they do everything else. Hell, look at the state of KSP2 - that is TakeTwo really pushing that game into early access before it's ready.  And remember TakeTwo wanted to shut down ALL mods for KSP1. TakeTwo is a horrendous piece of shit publisher right up there with the likes of Electronic Arts, but doesn't get quite the flak that Electronic Arts gets because TakeTwo mostly works on things that aren't quite as mainstream for PC, or for things that are mostly console titles like GTA.  Avoid GTA5, and I'd avoid buying GTA6 until well after release when it starts going on sale (maybe not even then - let's see the reviews first...)"
miaow
shovelware
gta 6 plz
you already know
"I love GTA V its a great game and i want everyone to play it at least once, game of the century bro"
"After owning this game since launch putting almost 100 hours into, I am now required to enter an activation code. Good thing Steam let's you check your key... Oh the game is telling me it's already in use, of course it's in use... by me... Great job Rockstar, truly living up to your name."
great game lots of Easter eggs and fun thing to do
OG fun game if u havent played it wyd
"It's pretty fun, though online mode is full of hackers."
good game verry good but old but wqith new things

"This game is a great game that is ruined by a useless and greedy dev. My friend recently had his social club account hacked and his information changed. Despite many attempts to prove his identity to Rockstar including receipts, screenshots and video evidence they have refused to validate his identity. He has 1000 hours in this game and they are willing to treat him this way. I can safely say I will not be buying GTA 6 if you know what I mean 🏴‍☠️ Fuck Rockstar.  I know this won't do anything but I am pissed at Rockstar and want to warn others to ensure their accounts are extremely secured lest it happen to you.   ***UPDATE***  After 2 weeks and 6 support tickets he finally got them to realise he was him, so I guess good job Rockstar? 6/10"
this review becomes positive as soon as Rockstar changes to dedicated servers

Its fun and funny
Because boom boom pew pew swoosh bam
Unplayable garbage without downloading 3rd party software and joining a specific community to play with. All online lobbies are plagued with hackers and modders that exist only to advertise services for sale or grief everyone. All the fanboys excited to GTA6 are too stupid to realize you can't even play the games they already have out as intended because they wont moderate anything and wont ban anyone. They simply don't even try.
The best game!!!
"This game is gold and will never die out for me. Best $10.48 spent of my life. Highly recommend if u neva played Gta-V (\_/) (-.-) />❤️  (also if u still playing the cracked gta-5 u just down bad, the actual gta 5 is so much better and with online (*/ω＼*)"
just yea
this was a game of all time for sure
very good good game fun fun
I love how this game captures the feeling of Los Angeles. The police continue to shoot you after you put your weapons away! Bravo Rockstar games
Just buy it dude
mrnjauuuuuuuuuuuu!
titties.
reg
very gud gejm naked women najs
"killed and robbed a plane,   very fun"
"It's a great game, like Red Dead Online, I love it, I'm really satisfied with it"
"Great game. It's been out forever now so if you haven't played it yet i'm not too sure where you have been. You should defiantly play it, also try out some RP servers as well for another experience."
"Just finished character creation, I guess it's okay so far"
It's like real life. You can do crime in both world.
No Likey RP. RP not for me.
JUST GOOD

great game cant wait until GTA VI
"Game is very very good, must play this game once in life, no any issue with Rock star games eagerly waiting for GTA 6, GTA V is a masterpiece no doubt. The game is playable until you have battery in laptop otherwise this game dont feel you boring so this game is very awesome and enjoyable. A lot of people had dream in their life to play GTA V once in their life. Yes tahts true I knew so No any drawbacks of playing this game but game is suitable for adults only because one or two missions had adult scene so that only can be improved rest is SIMPLY AWESOME.....!!!!!!!!"
its literally gta v OFCCC
GAME IS AWESOME NUTTED SO MANY TIMES AT THE STRIP CLUB
جييييييييييييييد
"I hate the fucking tutorial of this game, so time-comsuming @@"
"Yeah i really like the story and the game, completed it a few times on playstation. But i won't play it on my Computer for now since i have a poor one that doesn't have the requirements for the game. I will get a future pc where i will play Grand theft Auto on it."
its fun to play the game

The police force are very hardworking in this game
I like (grand theft auto 5) better than (grand theft auto V)    not gonna lie

"great story mode but online is to full of modders, and greifers"
how do i get in the car
AETYH
yeppppp
aways cannot start GTA Online and so many bug...
i like fvemobys
fun but gay moders
this is the best game but i need more mony
Probably one of the most addicting games i have ever played
ive played it a bit still broke in online
Just leaving my 420 hour review.
Rockstar has done nothing to address the modder problems that are well known on PC (Almost every GTAO lobby).   - You can have your account banned remotely by a modder - You can have funds removed from your account by a modder - Invite only lobbies / closed lobbies don't help you as they are even able to kill you in SINGLEPLAYER! - They can teleport you / everyone around the map at will and kill you at will - They can make you stumble in an endless loop so that you aren't able to move - The mods that they are using potentially go further than GTA and can be used to penetrate your PC  A firewall is a potential way to protect yourself but it doesn't make you invulnerable to these exploits This game has been out for 10 years and these problems still persist if you choose to play GTAV you're doing so at your own risk as this has spawn an environment for people to exploit without consequences.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXuLZ5tvQlY&ab_channel=TheProfessional
Great cant wait until VI
hit car funny
no gta 6 :angryface: :angryface:
Holy fuck i was literally grinding my money up for 13+ hours just to get banned for no reason LIKE WHAT. This is the second time its happening and im done bruh FUCK rockstar definitely top 3 worst developers of all time.
Fun \
great for all age especially 9 year olds there's no cursing nudity or drug use.
"Good game for SP and MP but please don't give Rockstar more money, just buy the game don't buy virtual currency. Have fun and try to buy it on sale. Bye! :)"
approved by mr.rio
Fun :0
game sangat bagus
very rad game

"Story's as good as ever but if you want to play Online, your options are limited, unless you want to be part of the cesspool."
jjjj
this is a timeless game
Great GTA game with latest tech and story is pretty nice as well. Overall its great story and gameplay is great overall. There are some things i hated about this game is that game missions are not played how you want to but have to play how its desinged. Also would be nice to have more fun activities to earn more money.
best realistic game ever
Online has a lot of cheaters on PC and connection issues severs can be shaky at times and the load times increase do to this but if you can learn to deal with it i do recommend this game Rockstar honestly gave it their all and the game can be fun and entertaining . i guess if you play the campaign only you don't have to worry about these issues the story mode is job well done. Every game has its issues i try to think of it that way.
Game has a crazy amount of options of things to do...but it is rather buggy and many aspects are terrible like flying on PC is god awful. So i find it odd the game is highly against mods when so many mods can fix a lot of quality of life changes. I would love to play online with my friends with some of the quality changes but I worry about getting banned. Unless i am terrorizing a lobby Idk why I cant fast travel across the map instead of waiting 30+ minutes IRL to get to my destination. 3 outta 5
This game ages like fine wine. Its still good.

Can't go wrong with GTA

"Updated review:  I think they're letting the game sink by choking new players from most profits. You'll probably need at least 100 hours of grind as a new player to get to a ""barely good"" enough state IF you put all your money into businesses. It's going to be a really tedious grind cause you will need 2 heists just to buy ONE CAR. The best profit avenue has been ridiculously nerfed and considering it takes about 1hr to set up and $100k in-game currency just to start setting up, I can no longer justify baring with the tediousness of the best profit avenue on the game.  R* probably just want players to move on to GTA 6 when it comes at this point, so I suggest saving up both your time,and your money and wait for it to come out.  Old review:  ""Ironically enough, the ""Grand Theft Auto"" part fades the longer you play the game cause you'll end up using cars you own and worked hard to pay for anyway. Or not use a car at all."""
"I bought the retail version of this game when it first launched. It worked fine with no issue at all for years. Then one day, Rockstar decided to launch their own launcher. All my Rockstar games stopped working, even the ones I had on steam. Since then, I've periodically tried to fix the issue and play GTA V. Tired of not having it work, I decided to buy it on Steam and see if anything changed, although I knew it wouldn't. I've got every error code in the book, I've tried every fix, all the official ones, all the Reddit ones, nothing. This garbage company decided to release their trash garbage launcher and I can't play the games I've payed for. At least I can refund this one. Rockstar, fix your garbage trash launcher no one wants or get rid of it. I only want to play singleplayer, why can't I bypass your garbage trash launcher? I finally decided to let the game run with the error code so I could write a review. This review is all I can do, the quiet echo of my voice will fade into nothingness, while this garbage trash company run by donkeys continues to profit. GTA IV and GTA V, two of my all time favorite games, now forever taken from me because the donkeys running this company wanted to gather more power. Maybe one day it won't be garbage trash anymore. Maybe, one can dream."

FULL OF FUN
It's Amazing
"My favorite Los Angeles simulator. I can drive the 110 to the 5 North without having 17 panic attacks. All of the online issues, including the ability for modders to see your IP address made it, sadly, unplayable.... but as far as a piece of software goes: Absolutely Tremendous."
its very fun but for the one still kid dont play this bc its kinda yea
Aprovado :)
ydrd
The prostitutes are great and all but CJ's place is gone and sad to see purple mfs in there in that mission
Pretty fun exept for the hackers fucking you up for no reason
"absolutely love the game, can't wait for GTA 6 and hoping that it can be run in 4k. but all round this is a really incredible game with alot of laughs and fun in their definitely going to get 100% achievement for this"
"Perfect game for children and even toddlers, with a wide range of charismatic and kind characters such as Trevor and Michael who are spectacularly written in such a way where you cant help but fall in love with there sheer optimism and loving personalities. furthermore this game features an incredible online multiplayer where your child may create their own custom character and head out into the fictional world of los santos ready to do an assortment of exciting and enjoyable activities such as golf, darts, arm wrestling and even visiting the shoe icon on the map near the centre of the city, it is at this icon where the player will be able to purchase all kinds of shoes and other footwear.  in conclusion this game is a great choice for you and your family ESPECIALLY your kids and while your at it, buy them a few shark cards 😁"
greatgame
Addicting    buy now

"Don't buy this game if you're coming from another platform, you will be required to start again."
"WHERE IS GTA 6 THIS GAME IS SO OUTDATED AND IT'S NEARLY UNPLAYABLE (THE HACKERS AND GAME BUGS WITH THE SLOW LOADING TIMES DRIVE ME NUTS).  Game was great when it came out, ""for its time"" I guess, but now it's very difficult to even play the game."
OLD IS GOLD BUY IT WONT HESITATE
"the best game i have ever played. Mixed with betrayal, brotherhood and emotion this is truly the masterpiece and the pinnacle of gaming experience. The story is awesome and the online mode is like no other, i highly recommend you to buy this game and enjoy with friends."
ROCKSTAR LANCHER MAKE MY PEE PEE SOFT
realistic game ever I played in my life
i would be doing this stuff in real life if gta wasnt a thing you already know this has been the best game around since it came out
very nice and intresting game.
roaming
good game but modder so annoying
online is good stuff. dont listen to whiny babies
the game is atractive
Cmon do I really need to explain why?
THIS GMAE
funjy
I've had this game for 2 years+ and I finally got it reinstalled for it now to say I need internet connection for activation. I've done everything I can think of to fix it and nothing works.  Not even Rockstar Social Club will work.  Definitely pissed with this game and Rockstar.
Red Dead Redemption 2 and 1 is 10 times better.
"Many things to grind out for, if you like grinding nonstop this is the game for you"
hm gta v cinco fivem 5
GTA story>rdr2 story
you can hit women
i like GTA 5
i really liked the game but the increasing modders are really pissing of where they are in god mode in every sesssions and damn hard to play due to increase in modders ..
I like to play this game once in a while to commit acts of terrorism.
amazing!!!!! this game turned me into a homophobic piece of shit and racist
"its gta, its been out 10 years its one of the best sellers ever i cant say anything worthwhile"
good with mods/ fivem/ or single player mods. story mode is good the online is ruined at this point dont buy for online the grind is gross
very fun and easy to mod. very original game but would not recommend to minors
"the heists are super fun , i definitely recommend"
kiri
play on steam deck worked amazing until i left it for a month now im having trouble getting back ok gta
haahahahhahahahh
chaos

"A good game to spend a lot of time, they keep updating it frequently only downside are hackers in every session."
"Buggy game, online is almost unplayable."

GTA V is the best game to relax and play if ever you are just stressed out because you can commit crimes you apparently cant do irl so yeah atleast story mode is the best for that but online is just for if you hate yourself and making things much worse but overall my fav game.. :>
slaps
only did this cause the 269 :)
I mean after so many years this game is still worth the purchase
the only thing i dont like is the modders in online mopde its not right that there still in the game
still alive
G D A
bought it only for mod LSPDFR
That's why it's the GOAT!!! The GOAT!!
"good game be like do in real, life"
gg wp
Love this game and now with mods! On another level!
nice game gta 5 my dream game
I did everything I wanted to do in real life here.
uhhhhh strip club uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh thats about it
hate my wife
"The problem is this idiotic Rockstar Social Club bullshit.   If you did not play the game for a long time and if you do not have access or remember the social club email you used the first time. You are shit out of luck. You will never play the game again.   The game is locked into the first social club you created via Steam and there is no way to reset the login and the Rockstar Help desk is useless. Which is not surprising. The support options in games are for the most part, complete and utter shite.   I guess, I will delete the game and forget I ever played it."
this is an awesome game
"tembak, rempit, kongkek"
my game account are hacked
dont buy gta.. unless you want a major headache with the fucking rockstar launcher
Best Game Ever love it!!

300/10.. A good buy everytime. It's on sale now so grab it while you can.
Love the game been playing since release finnaly got it for my PC last month and allready clocked in 600+ hrs!! Recommend the RP servers on PC!!!
this game is great never gets old
(Y)
great online play
"Riddled with hackers absolutely insane prices for cash grab. grinding, annoying 12 year olds. people feeling the need to be pieces of shit 24/7 worst community. Terrible UI, loading screens, heists are fucked. solo play is annoying and almost impossible. Ive tried doing a heist setup 4 times for a hacker to fuck up my mission begging for telegram money. How about you actually put some effort into your game to prevent one piece of shit from ruining everyones experience. youve had over a decade and you sit on your asses collecting money from the shark cards. Sad thing is im still gonna keep playing, if gta 6 is anything remotely like this im never buying a rockstar game again"
IMPORTANT!!!  Go online to Los Santos Cars as there are plenty of free cars there that get delivered to your garage. FYI get a garage near your home if it doesn't come with!!!
"IT'S REALLY GOOD, THANKS ROCKSTAR FOR THIS FABULOUS GAME"
good game like that
gooog
"Awesome sandbox, has a huge hacker/modder problem though"
"Commiting Crimes, Mass Murder and wiping out some NPCS is fun.  Just have fun trying to survive in the online servers."
brrrrr gun
"Look, I'm gonna say just one thing, and one thing only:  If you haven't tried out this game, do so. But beware that on keyboard and mouse, it's quite hard to control helicopters and planes."
game of modders...everyone using mod on online
cause it is good?
best game i have played i bought this game when it came  out and i am still playing it
i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
What to say about the All time Legendary game GTA 5    loved it to the Core
this is just straight up fun
SARCASM IS ALL I FUCKING GOT!
"It's an incredibly immersive and action-packed game with a vast open world to explore. The storyline is gripping, the graphics are stunning, and the gameplay is addictive. Whether you're into intense missions or just want to roam around causing chaos, GTA V has something for everyone. Overall, it's a must-play for any gaming enthusiast!"
gg geming
"Addictive game yet fun open world.  There are 2 thing I highly dislikes : Cheater and lagging.  Both happen when Online mode. I don't know if there is mod that player can go invincible, if there is, highly suggest remove those, its super annoying when 1 play fair and the other using cheat mode. Here's my best solution for DEV: Update the game by adding anti-cheat mode for Online so the cheater are blocked"
thank you dev for supporting me about dlc like the flash best game best dev forever

"When it came out , i was enjoying Gta vice city sitting by the window listening to the rain It was really a hype in my elementary school everyone used to talk about it , people who had played it had to provide a proof with a picture of them playing it XD , now as i own it i'll say it was really worth the hype back then and even now is , i tried the Gta online but online games are not my cup of tea so i put it away for good..when i will have enough time in future i look forward to play it again :)"
Good game but guni fucking sucks at staying alive

-Story mode pretty good  -Online (for PC) is pretty trash filled with Scripters/hackers
love this game reccomended
this game was fun and all but tbh its like beating a dead horse.. the game needs to hurry up and release the next gta and let this one die in the past.. 5m servers would be fun but they also are trash due to all the wannabe gangster kids that vdm or rdm every chance they get.. aslo keep in mind 5m is not friendly to new players.. they expect everyone to just automatically know how to do everything..   long story short yes gta5 was fun in like 2013 but its a little over played at this point.. i need a new map and new things to do
good story
Addicting Game!
I sure love murdering hundreds of innocent civilians on a Saturday evening
you know why haha
epic hackerfest
"It's GTA, duh."
I love killing level 7s

Fast forward a decade later, you play as a ex-Families Gang member named Franklin Clinton, repoing a car for Simeon Yeterian.  You are eventually tasked to repo a car from a kid named Jimmy De Santa, and sure enough you get a handgun pointed to your dome.  Turns out that man you played as Michael Townley is now Michael De Santa,  who faked his death during the heist to enter a Witness Protection Program.  Smash into the car shop window, Michael pays you for a job well done.  The games event’s then spontaneously kick off from that and propels the plot.        There is a variety of activists to do in Los Santos or Blaine County; such as events, Strangers and Freaks, Activities, and some events get your new heist members for future heists. The gunplay in the game is linear, but smooth and intuitive.  The special abilities the trio have are unique and engaging.  It helps you to have an edge over the various enemies in the world such as the Los Santos Police Department,  the Ballas, etc.  Activities are somewhat repetitive, and boring after a while.  The Strangers and Freaks mission is a mixed bag, some of the characters are fun and engaging;  while others are monotone and annoying.  Tasked with different tasks based on the Stranger you are dealing with and what they want.  The game in my playthrough which is somewhat rushed, but also doing all the events and a quarter of the Strangers and Freaks missions; the entire length of the game took me about 39.2 hours to beat. A felt like a real ride, with a sense of achievement based on the 1 of 3 endings you choose. That will be something you will have to find out in your playthrough.   8.5/10 would strongly recommend this game for it’s single-player experience alone, not so much for online because of the rampant hackers in lobbies."
THISAMENNNNNN
Story good online bad
HAHA
"Amazing game with great assets. A lot of things to unlock in the Story Mode but also a great experience while playing in Online Mode. Definitely a game you'll be playing for a long time, as grinding everything costs a lot of time. This does match up with very good results though, so it's definitely worth the playtime!"

Worst load times by a huge margin in any game ive played or seen. For each time u load somewhere like walking into your house theres a 20% chance it will NEVER load and u will have to alt f4 to restart. Game is made of 10% cheaters who can do anything they want to u and usually have godmode. Starting out is very confusing and doesnt give u any guidance so rely on looking everything up. Any vehicle u will want is incredibly unaffordable and will cost u ur whole bank account which u spent hours doing boring tasks to save up. UI is horrible and keybinds dont make any sense. They different for doing the same thing in different scenarios. Definitely dont waste ur time with this game. Its over 10 years old and it shows. Too much.
ONE OF THE GREATEST OPEN WORLD GAME OF ALL TIME GTA V THE GOAT OF THE VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY
game speaks for itself
"It's GTA 5, go buy it."
wagwan g
best game by far
The added a membership and have removed old cars to put them into the membership. They are straight up going for money and do not care about their gamers. Its worse micro transaction tactics than EA/Blizzard. Garbage. ill just mod my game and get everything for free or play on a modded server.
"My account got stolen after 6 years, and there is no way to recover it."

THIS IS SO FUN I CAN RUN OVER PEOPLE
"I recommend the game for the story mode, which is the quintessential GTA V experience that we've all known for the last 10 years.   This game is probably the most fun driving experience I've had outside of dedicated racing games, and every other game falls short when compared to this one.  HOWEVER ONLINE MODE  As a new player you should be super aware that modders in lobbies are very common. And most have a superiority complex. About 60% of the time it's fine unless you try to get in a fight with one, in which case you will have a bad time, being stuck in a death loop. Best way to avoid that is to just type in chat that you're going to go AFK and stop giving them the satisfaction- they give up super quickly. (or just move to a new lobby of course).  Even ignoring modders- as a new player it's pretty hard to get to the good content- which is all the expensive stuff in the game- this truly is the American dream which Rockstar has made millions from over the last 10 years. I used to play the game on console so I've had an easier time getting used to it however- 90% of modders are selfish, but occasionally you'll get random modders who'll just give you a tonne of XP and money which can help you skip a lot of grinding.  If you ever reach the point you get a lot of items- good cars, guns, apartment etc- it's pretty satisfying.  Online mode is full of modders- usually fine until they decide to grief you- in which case you move to a new lobby. you can still have fun in the game though- there's a lot to do, and sometimes its kinda overwhelming as a new player. if you're lucky a nice modder will just give u money and levels, and then you can actually enjoy the game- it's a slick experience when you have a lot of the stuff- otherwise it's a pain to grind."
"Got locked out of my account, showed them that I clearly bought the game from my steam account to reconnect my rockstar to a new account, they said they can't verify that its my account. WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SPENT 60 BUCKS ON THIS GAME"
fun specially online
good game. very entretaining
"GTA 5 is one of my favorite games i have played. I think that the story is great and in depth with characters, as well as the beautiful details  of the map that rockstar put in the game. gta online is when you get to the fun part of the game when doing heists, and buying all of the cool things the shop  has to offer. The the things you should be aware of are the glitches/bugs, and the amount of griefers in online mode."
everthig
"i launched the game's online mode and afk for 30 mins, after i came back it was still loading. wtf?"
hegh
nothing like the console game and driving is really a bugger
Shawty kno I kill people
money moves
heheheheeh i like doing illegal stuff
probably one of the best games of all time
"driving isnt the greatest the wheels turn on their own to stop you from drifting , probaubly because every 12 year old cant drive so they had to make it so easy that you cant even spin out on purpose to have some fun and try to drift, also random cars on the street shouldnt handle the same as a 3 million dollar car."
I'd play again
game is genuinely one of the worst made games ive ever played lmao. everytime you die during a heist setup it spawns you next to the thing that kills you. cant even get back in the vehicle you came in cause it got impounded. i pray to god these game developers burn in hell for the rest of time how did anyone think this was a good idea.
No one reads the reviews so I'm going to say that I'm not the real Jim Halpert.
GREAT CHOICE
so many fucking hackers

Just wait for GTA 6. It is promised to be better. :)

"Had to delete every single game I owned, take a few hours to make space, delete random crap I didn't even knew I had, near accidently broke my computer by uninstalling important shit, just to still only have 16 GB left.  Anyway also get FiveM pretty good tbh"
"I love this game so much , its fun and chill , cant wait for GTA VI or RDR3"

"Fun Story mode, I love the driving.  When you have had a bad day, murdering a bunch of random digital people can be oddly calming.  Not at all safe to play in front of the kids. I  do not enjoy the Trevor story that much, It leans into psychopath too much for me."
Waiting for GTA 6. This will help pass the time and think about what the future holds for Rockstar.

cool game just boring without friends
"game not launching. tried installing 3 time, yet not launching."
"this game never got me bored, there is always something to do"
love the game a lot
ggggggggggggggggooooooooooooooooooooooooooodddddddddddddddddddd
gta 5 is nice
"I love this game, only problem I have with it is the online modders that grief but aside from that highly recommend!"
Singleplayer story is amazing. Have played it multiple times both on consoles and PC. GTA Online has changed for the worse with in my opinion lazy DLC. The grinding nature is not fun. Stupid vehicles like the MK2 opressor which every sweat will use even towards a new level 1 player.  Still doing your daily objectives in GTA Online is quite fun.  If you have never played the story of GTA V before then I highly recommend you doing so.
"fucking hackers in this game,  gta 5 no goood"
"Good game, is very fun"
"The game is awesome point blank, but the one thing that plagues this game and Rockstar seems to not even care or they are promoting it in the background, is the modders and hackers. its sad to see this game at this state. Its not hardly playable just today of me playing every session had hackers or modders in it. its also sad to see the money that we the players put into the game go to the way side and over a billion company can't or won't even put it back into the game to fix the problem and not just ignore it."
Solitude in E Minor
"The most cancerous and horrible game ever created. The joy has been sucked out of this game since 2015, the only people who play this now are degenerate losers who ride on sky-bikes blowing you up out of nowhere. Rockstar has proven several times they hate their audience and customers, leaving users I.P addresses exposed in public servers and destroying modders careers. If you think GTA 6 is going to be any different or better, you should take a good look at how this game was treated for over a decade."
Main Story's great. GTA Online?Absolute dissapointment.Throws a million things at you once you finish the tutorial.Not to mention you might get in a server where toxicity is through the roof!

INSANE GAMEE
"Forget about what percentage of reviews are positive . . . look at the NUMBER of reviews here. This is a milestone in gaming, and anyone who ""likes video games"" should play it. It's a really good story, and it doesn't get boring at any point. The worst thing about this game is that I can't let my kids play it yet."
"Would not let me adjust my brightness to be able to see the game to play in online mode.  You can do this in story mode though?  That's dumb enough for me to not want to play anymore after coming back from a long break.  There is no way to change this in online mode to make the game playable while it is nighttime.  I would have to quit mission, load into story mode, turn it up or down and have to wait for time of day to change to make sure I can SEE???  That is the most asinine thing I have ever had to do to change a setting.  After another hundred hours I've grown tired of the time/money walls.  I cannot complete sell missions without running out of time if I solo.  The rest of the time is spent solely on resupplies.  No other way to make decent money.  Had I known the hangar takes 50 resupply missions to fully stock I would have never bought it.  Takes me so long to generate the millions it took just to see my time spent/money gained go right out the window.  So much so that I uninstalled and will not play this again.    So I played it again...  This time I bought a office so I can be able to buy a warehouse so I would be able to buy a Phantom Wedge.  Turns out that it was not very forthcoming with what I needed to buy in order to unlock the Phantom Wedge. Instead I bought some crate business that requires me to buy the stuff in order to sell?  Also I can't store the truck I want to buy there but instead have to buy yet another worthless to me warehouse in order to store a truck.  So many cash holes to deal with just to be able to buy the stupid truck.  Could not find a single guide online or video explaining this process.  So dumb. I just want to drive a truck with a wedge...  why is this so hard to do?   All in all if you wanna play this game, do the story mode, use hax to get stuff u don't wanna waste time getting and have your fun and move on."

"Fun Ass Game, I just don't like how annoying and disruptive people on there could be. I'm guessing those types of people are people who never got any love or affection from their mommy and daddy, so they're taking it out on people online because they're incapable of being humans in real life, which is truly sad. Otherwise, I love the game."

hhh
its very fun with end less things to do every one say oh GTA has drugs s#x but didn't really see any of that cause i just run around robing stores but if you run out of things to do you can get mods
"still a really good game for how old it is. still love the story. i know gta 6 is ""supposed"" to come out ""soon"", idrc bc this game will always be on top!"

This is a very good game man)

"My favourite game series of all time, and this is one of the best individual games, just getting into online super super late and once I got my head round it (and with the help of friend-only lobbies) I'm having the time of my life, still prefer the early 2000's games to this overall, but otherwise this is my favourite!"

Lost the final 2 brain cells i had playing multiplayer.
Its GTA so 10/10. When is GTA 6 coming out though?
"game would be cool if you didnt have to download the rockstar shit, always having problems with the rockstar launcher, maybe they should take that out"
literally unplayable in public lobbies because of cheating in every single one

"at most install 10 mods, game didnt work, did a lot of shenagins, never want to mod again. 100% enjoyable"
"GTAV is a well-known, open-world, crime based video game that is a favorite among the gaming community. What else do I have to say? It's an amazing game and I recommend it to all gamers out there."

is good but rockstar very greedy with shark boy lavagirl cards grindy online experience feels like real job needs be more grounded too many high-tech vehicles and guns this is not advanced infinite warfare call of battlefield ok?
While this game is a master piece Rockstar seams to have left their prized trophy to decay on the shelf. Gta V online is absolutely FILLED with hackers. i couldnt find a SINGLE lobby without one. to play without hackers you need a entire seperate client. absolutely unacceptable for a company like rock star
Its one of the best games by Rockstar Games
its a good game thums up :]
The online game mode has a Mazda RX7

"GTA 5 & GTA Online is a game that never gets old, with endless possibilities and fun. The game lets you live out your fantasies of being a criminal mastermind or a vigilante hero, or anything in between. The game's world is huge and immersive, with tons of activities, missions, and events to enjoy with other players. The game also has a lot of customization options, allowing you to create your own unique character, vehicle, and property. GTA 5 Online is a game that keeps evolving and improving, with regular updates and additions that keep the game fresh and exciting."

"love GTA V. loved it on PS3. 4. 5. and now PC. being able to mod it (offline) has opened up an entire world of replayability for me. that a game is still relevant 10 years after launch really speaks to the quality assurance at rockstar. where devs like ubisoft, bethesda, 2K, and EA release broken/unfinished game after game - Rockstar has been pretty consistent in releasing quality product."

very fun game to play with your friends
"As-salamu alaykum, dear friends and gamers. Allow me to share my thoughts on the captivating world of ""Grand Theft Auto V."" This game, set in the sprawling streets of Los Santos, reminds me of the diverse landscapes and cultures of our Middle Eastern lands, a blend of tradition and modernity.  In ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" players find themselves navigating the intricate web of crime and ambition, much like the stories of ancient civilizations and the great caliphates of the past. The game offers a rich tapestry of characters, each with their own motivations and desires, mirroring the complexities of human nature that have fascinated our scholars for centuries.  The virtual Los Santos, a sprawling metropolis, mirrors the bustling cities of our region, with its towering skyscrapers and crowded streets. The attention to detail in this game is akin to the intricate mosaic work found in our historical mosques, every pixel a testament to the dedication of the creators.  One cannot ignore the exhilarating vehicular chases and heists that form the core of the gameplay. As we navigate the dangerous criminal underbelly of Los Santos, it's as if we are embarking on a thrilling desert caravan journey, braving the elements and facing the unknown. The rush of adrenaline is akin to the heart-pounding feeling one might experience during a challenging pilgrimage to Mecca.  Yet, it is crucial to acknowledge that ""Grand Theft Auto V"" also touches upon the consequences of our actions, a reflection of the teachings of Islam. The choices made by the characters, and by extension, the player, have repercussions that resonate throughout the game's narrative. It serves as a reminder of the importance of ethical conduct and the consequences of one's deeds, in line with our faith's teachings.  The sound design of the game, with its blend of Middle Eastern-inspired music and modern beats, creates a unique atmosphere that resonates with our cultural heritage while immersing us in the world of Los Santos.  However, it is essential to approach ""Grand Theft Auto V"" with a discerning eye and a commitment to the values of Islam. The game does explore themes of violence and criminality, and it is crucial to maintain a sense of balance and responsibility in our interactions with it.  In conclusion, ""Grand Theft Auto V"" is a remarkable experience that, like the tapestry of Islam, weaves together a multitude of elements into a vibrant and engaging whole. It invites us to explore the human condition and navigate the complexities of a dynamic world, reminding us of the ever-evolving nature of our own lives. Approach it with wisdom and reflection, and you may find it to be a thought-provoking journey through the streets of Los Santos. Peace be upon you all."

simply the best.
niggas should not own cars
Would not recommend the game based solely on the fact that you have to sign into a Rockstar Social account when you start playing.  I bought the game mostly for single player and this is retarded.
YES I DOD
"Red dead redemption with sex, pretty sure there are cars and shit too that's pretty cool"
"why was when i was standing still a woman punched me, so yk what i did? i poured gasoline on that bitch and fucking emoted on her dead corpse, then i resorted to cannibalism. L game ngl i should've been able to sell her decomposing organs on a random internet website the meaning of the story? idk my brains too retarded to comprehend anything, i resorted to cannibalism remember?"
very fun game free roam missions i highly recommend it
Good graphics amazing 👏
this game is 1 mil times better than any game like red dead redemption
very fun when u figure out the sign in

game is ruined by modders and hackers. Rockstar doesn't care
Never thought I'd still be playing this damn thing for 10 years. First person mode is a blast.
"amazing, simply amazing"
playing this game with friends is goated
"Instead of starting the game, there starts a ""Launcher"". In said launcher, I am demanded to craft an account. After about 20min of work for complying, my account is refused because the launcher insists that I must use another account that it insists I would possess that I know nothing about. So, thanks for nothing. If GTA VI would suffer the same limitation then that will unchoicefully imply my lack of accessibility (meaning in addition that I will not buy it)."
W game make s me have an fucking orgasm
why does ketchup comes out when i shoot someone?
GOAT game nuff said
"even though i have done nothing wrong to disobey the rules of the online mode, they still decided to delete my character from the game, wasted all my money on this game just to do that, dont waste your time guys"

i only use it for lspdfr but great game
"way better frames than on consoles. I have played this game on a ps4 for about 4 years now, and this is a massive improvement,.   if you're looking for more customizability, I advise you to add mods like Menyoo and any Simple Trainer (since that gta online dlc cannot be spawned in without a trainer). it is one of the best mod menus out there."
fuckin horrible fix the game
its gta!
GOOD GAME AND I LIKE IT
thisgame is so fun. the modders make it a bit better but it depends cuz the modders got me banned during my trophy run :[
"The best game in 2013, dated in 2023. It's Rockstar's dead horse propped up by artificial limbs and ketamine. Also barely playable without crashing on my monitor in 4K, with a 3080Ti."
Was good now is bad
gta v is awesome but five m is just 10x better

Once u make like 10-15 mil u can have anyhing in the game (online) and it becomes boring beacuse u have nothing to do. There's no need to grind for more money. The single player is legendary. I recommend it!
it was very sztisfying
"good game, very fun, lots to do, modding issues but its PC so what do you expect, would recommend to people"
it is great and everyone is so nice and loving

Get rid of your stupid dependency on the Rockstar Games Launcher
"im diamond 1 a rp off of champ, im diamond 1"

"Yes I would recommend this game. Its fun and is full of stuff to do. It is more fun to play with friends of course, but you can still interact with other players inside the game. But if you are under at least 14, its not really the most family friendly game to play. But other from that, its a great game."

"I played GTA San Andreas, Liberty City and Vice City on PSP, GTA IV and so far this is the best in the series. I like all the characters and gets more fun as the story goes. Gameplay is just so satisfying and immersive. Still listening to funny ads and commentaries on the tv and radio."
its allright i guess

"i still want GTA 6, and Im honestly tired of this game, but this game is good."
great game ever!
I know the RP scene is big and they deserve all the love and support in the world. But vanilla GTAO is just another cash grab borderline waste of time but it's definitely on the edge. Have a lot of good memories but none of my friends or family wanna touch it anymore lol except for RP. Stop giving Rockstar your money just give it to RP server hosts.

i like playing online mode and shoving over homeless people

"This game is full of hackers and really mean people. I am specifically talking about the online portion. If you want to play online, do not go near this game. It is one of the most toxic, awful things that you can come across. I expected more, but the players are awful to be around, and no one will ever be fun to play with."
"Had to uninstall, too many modders"
5 OUT OF 5
non stop pop fm saved my life   i lied it was the music locker
Good Graphics and interesting gameplay. I purchased this game in 952 rs during sale.

"This game is extremely amazing and fun, even more if you get LSPDFR and mod your LSPDFR."
jesus is him.
Rockstar still not properly supporting PC with  missing content and near zero attempt to remove players using mod menus. Public lobbies have more modders than a cod game
клас вот и всё
Its so fun and also very easy to get mods. I love everything about gta on steam
Not bad. We all know its a good game but its time for something new..
still better than Cyberpunk 2.0
The game is dying. They're adding less and less content. Its a goofy sandbox from time to time but grows old pretty quick. (I have over 200 days on console)
A very good nice cars good heists nice story
its rlly cool
Absolute classic of a game...now give us GTA 6!
PLeAse VeRiFy yOUr GaME dAta

"GTA Online is barely working. Do you need another 10 years to develop multiplayer? I love this game, but comparing to console, PC version is unplayable online. Even $15 I paid feels like too much for this."
amazing gaming and can keep you entertained for awhile playing the story mode and also because of the updates

This is the greatest video game of all time

"robbed a colombian guys island and then blew up his car following the instructions of a drunk russian man, 10/10"
The GTA Online experience.  Log on. Can't afford anything. Grind boring content for 20 hours to buy a mid car. Get sick of the BS. Buy a second hand Megalodon Shark Card code for $20. Buy the submarine. Grind Cayo Perico for 30 hours. Fly around on the rocket bike blowing people up cause there is no endgame. Realize you have blown 200+ hours and never had a second of fun. 30 of those hours were spent in loading screens. uninstall.
"As someone who played it on Xbox (over 5 days worth playtime) I would definitely recommend this game for PC. If you're coming from console, it may take some getting used to, but it's a fun game to play overall no matter what device you're playing on."
Helps you practice what to do when people test you IRL

"Great game. One of the best games to add mods like cars and lspdfr. Plus the third party Roleplay servers. playing online is not fun. i dont suggest. it has lots of cheaters, it is heavily rigged and unfair for missions and some jobs."

W RP Game  Best Game so far since my childhood.......................
Great and all but they are locking away updates and only giving them to PlayStation and Xbox. Rock* also refuses to implement cross platform.

Very fun game in the beginning then becomes a grind game . The hacker and modders are unstoppable in gta online sometimes they attack the lobby with some shit and can ban your account !.
If you forget the email you used to link steam & rockstar social club then your locked out of your account forever once it force logs you out.
U CAN ROB STORES STRIP CLUBS MILITARY BASE AND EVERYTHING U WANT CARS GARAGE HOUSE *(*((**************************
story mode was fun
you can shoot people
One of my favorite games of all time!
how does one reset their multiplayer account.
this vvideo gassme is pretty fum
good game but lots of hackers
ONE OF THE GREATEST GAMES IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY.  10/10 played this on the xbox360  in 2013 played it again on the xbone 2.0 in 2015 played it again on the PC in 2019 so i bought a PS5 at costco for 600$ so i could play demons souls remastered bought demons souls remastered for 70$ played it for 40 hrs within a month returned PS5 for full refund. realized i can do this with the PS6 and bloodborne remastered.  will play this again on the xbox xsx tricky one series bone in 2028 will play this again on the PC 2.0 in 2030 but who in the hell knows if ill ever play GTA 6
you feel like a god when playing story for the first time
my dream
"I believe this game has heists or missions or a story mode, yeah I haven't done any but the driving is fun and just the chaos of the online lobby is fun"
great loading screen siimulation
] '{=;l[']
Haha gun go bangbang (:
"My first GTA game. Great story, interesting characters but some missions are quite boring but Stranger mission are real fun and the writing done in this game is great. GTA Online though is still up for debate for me since it was fun at first but after a while when you have tons of money in your bank it does get quite boring. Not many interesting going on since the updates are really slow and there are double and even triple money events but like I said it does get boring after you reach a certain limit but achieving that limit is quite fun (I guess...) GTA5: 9/10  Online: 6/10"
fujunfufn
this is one of the best games ever espetshaly for the price
"i started playing this around 9, i think i might be a psychopath"
väga tore ja lastesõbralik mäng <3
Satisfying
"i love killing innocent civilians, sad theres no kids"
W Game!
"The game is alright, need a few more hours before I finalize my thoughts on it."
"Really enjoyed playing this game. One the best, if not the best of all time. Can not wait for  GTA VI"
"Bom não sei por onde começar. O Jogo é incrivel,a historia é impolgante, A ambientação é foda(npc's e mapa) as possibilidades são muito fodas. No incio eu fiquei muito impolgado, mas no final chorei, não so de emoção mas de alegria tbm.  O mapa podia ser maior. Embora foi ambliado no GTA ONLINE, eu ainda acho que podia ser maior. Não Posso esperar por uma sequencia. KD O GTA 6 ROCKSTAR!!!!  (SPOILER)  Eu acho que no final da opção B na qual voce escolhe o michael, o dinheiro podia ser distribuido para o trevor pelo menos ."
i love that the game updates regularly and always has new things to do..
GTA Online so many cheaters
decent game i got on a discount do recommend but beware of hackers
Is a pretty nice game
banka soyuon
The game is good not doubt but need more customization and access to building to another level.

How can you not like gta5? Online sucks now a days but the story is great.
"it's pretty good, the online is fun but i hate the fact that sometimes after the mission ends the game will just become a blackscreen and no if you're gonna say it's because i have a weak pc then your're very wrong, i have a 3060 ti and the game runs in 200 fps, if you encounter this too or you know a way i chould solve this then i'd like you leave a comment."
You get depression from MKII.
I THINK GTA 5 IS THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD

yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss               iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiyttttttttttttttttttttttttassssssssssssssssss
"stop being scared from society, this game isn't a master piece. its a piece of shit made by a shit company who never cares about its players. gta5 is an old cow that is still being milked by r* the online is in a terrible state where it became unplayable: [b]1)[/b]so long loading screens and most of the time you get kicked out after a long ass waiting. [b]2)[/b] the online is full of cheaters that will kill you and destroy your stuff and all you can do is watch. [b]3)[/b]glitches everywhere. [b]4)[/b]the grind is unreal, and everything is expensive with the low missions and heists pay rate. r* made it so hard so they can make players buy shark cards. well done you piece of sh1t company. [h1] story 5/10[/h1] [h1] online 1/10[/h1]"
it is just the best story game ever if you dont think it is try it out
no kids to kill 0/10
"Best game graphic wise , cant wait for the next one"
Just WOW!!!!!
the gameplay is peak
I like to steal jets and pretend im tom cruise
these is a my dream game
very fun with or without friends
Gosh this game is insanely fun! I love that it's a shooting game! You can steal vehicles and you can also do missions on here as well! Please play this game!!
cancerware. DO NOT BUY.
"Good game, but need money to have fun fr"
Best game ever OP
if u need to buy u can this game is ultimate i have played 15 hours+
Rockstar's launcher sucks major ass and they should be arrested for it.
"It's no GTA VI, but it's ok."
need more teamwork
"i bought this game many years ago, the computer i had back then wouldnt run the game properly so the 52hours was me playing around with the system. many years later ive built a new pc. i try to play the game but rockstar want me to log in using the email i had many years ago. i dont have that email anymore so even though i still have the same steam account and the purchase of the game, i cant play it. been in conact for the last couple days and no help at all. Rockstar games are shit! find another game through a different service."
Rockstar is money hungry. game was good before rockstar decided to suck it dry. online is loaded with modders also the flying vehicles are pay to win and take no skill. story mode is 10/10 tho great single player as usual with rockstar.
Very kid friendly game. Loved playing it with my 6 year old son. BIG THUMBS UP!!!!!!!!!
"Been playing on console for almost ten years and decided to grab this on sale for RP purposes. So far it has been an even more enjoyable experience through the first week after purchase. I can safely recommend this game to anyone, but I'm sure anyone and everyone has either played or heard about this game by now."
Nice game to grind
Got it gifted for my birthday
its the best game eva
there is sex
love killing police
story mode yes online no   (i repeatedly got turned into a chicken)

modding is a bitch

"GTA Games have one thing in common, Its storytelling. And GTA 5's story was great as usual. The graphic, The mechanic, There wasn't much to badmouth. Variety of new cars, And I loved the online. It gave me and others a chance to play with friends and make friends. But just like others, I didn't like it when most of the cars were erased from online shops. But let's get back to story mode, I liked Trevor the most, His character in-depth was amazing, He's cruel but not a psychopath. He loves his mom and values loyalty which is shown in Ending B. When Franklin asks for Trevor's help to kill Michael, Trevor refuses instantly, But when it is Ending A, Michael agrees. It tells that Michael values his family more than anything, He tells it on some occasions as well. And as for Franklin, He's the street man who wants to leave that life behind. (But he just upped the game) From the interactions and everything from these three characters I thought, Trevor was the muscle, Michael was the leader, Franklin was the peacekeeper (Bonus) Lester was the brain. And, There's more to the story than what I explained, Other than just playing the online, I suggest you play the story mode as well. But the most important part in the story (In my own conclusion) Was the three protagonists, They're all in the end doing what they're doing to achieve a better life. And I think I rumbled too long xD"
It's GTA V
I CANT GET INTO THE GAme anymore waaaaaaaaa
trfefeer
"Online is an abomination!!! I can't get into any lobby where people modding make the game completely unplayable! I am getting teleported into random spots and killed over and over, if I try and do a job, I can spend all this time completing objectives only for someone at the very last second to make enemy vehicles fly all over, and all of the cars tires to explode at the same time. I can't even do a race without someone just blowing up my wheels over and over until they finish and can't control it anymore i guess. I loved this game on console back when it was first out, and after rebuying it for pc, I wish I could get a refund.   0/0"
online doo doo in 2023 without mods
Best Free Mode Game AND The Best Missions AHHAHHAHha IDK why but gta 5 gives me vibes that i cant explain but it feels good
pp gta got bb gun beam sss op
yes when it works
I like murdering prostitutes
syir
im in the loading screen longer then in the game
Always a go to game
Best game out there
Fivem :D
"Play online, offline. Its better, go online once you have the capabilities to escape people easily and also fight back. That or just play the story, I've heard it is great."
Cops ai are great😑😑
okkkkkkk
good 10 years old game
"I've been playing it since 2015 and it always get me into it from how thriving the game is. especially having all the things I'm interested in. Shooting, racing, robbery grinding to get money. I would recommend this to my friends."
NNNN
"A game that was made in 2013 and still holds up in 2023, 10 YEARS LATER! - #respect. I wont even complain about the amount of hackers and cheaters always teleporting all over the map and stuff, but even just playing the story mode is still brilliant.   The only thing that i am now desperately waiting for is for the developers to PLEASE HURRY UP AND RELEASE GRAND THEFT AUTO 6... Why is it taking soooooo long to publish GTA 6. Please launch it and also put it here on STEAM FIRST.  Otherwise, I love this game, its cool."
this game is goated
ther is sxe -Some kid in the reviews of GTA IV here on steam
"gun go pew pew, then you get money"
GOAT...Not much more to be said.
best gamee  ofccc
very good game!!!!
its fun and can keep me entertained for a long time
running over people is entertaining to say the least
where is the strip club
"This is not towards Steam or the Actual game itself, This is due to the very horribly integrated ""Social Club"" that has caused me and many others to suffer for what we paid for, Recently had my Social Club account hacked and the hacker linked their email to my Steam purchase of GTA, I have managed to reobtain my account and made sure to activate 2FA so it doesnt happen again but now im stuck waiting on Rockstar support to relink my steam purchase of GTA to my Social Club account so I can even play the game on single player, They do not allow you to play the game without being signed into social club so im stuck with a game I own that I cant play even offline if wanted to and tbh I dont even know if Rockstar will even relink the game to my account so I may just be screwed, guess I will find out within the next week or so whenever they decide to get back to me"
THE BEST GAME U`VE GOT TO CHECK IT OUT
This is a good game i like to EAT RATS AND BE A RAT IN THE GAME like in a rat costume
hoped on stuck at the trevors misson with the plane so fucking hard and boring to do so i decided to play online while im constantly getting fucked by flying cars that are getting drived by proffesional ph stars.
best game ewer fr frrr!!!
"It's a Grand Theft Auto game, what's not to like?!  Graphics are brilliant, story is amazing, online components are super fun. I have over 1000+ hours on my PS3 and even more on the PS4 before playing it more here. With the right group of people, online heists are extremely fun! It might come off as grindy, but it is worth it.  Highly recommend for that someone that somehow still does not own this masterpiece!"
good game with lots to do in online mode.
570.0 hrs on record and still its look like the first time i played ;  It’s fair to say this game is the best game of my life ( [spoiler]after CS:GO lol[/spoiler] )
lovely game 10/10
"As a recent indoctrinate into PC gaming, I've recently been revisiting games from my childhood. I spent 500 hours on GTA 5 on the Xbox 360 watching strippers and now I can put another 500 doing it on my PC. The 4k textures just make all 3 inches get nice and thick unlike the hair on Trevor Phillips head. Would recommend!"
dis game make me cum in lazar

"one of the BEST open world games out there. outstanding graphics, along with an impressive story."
"today in online i got chased by a guy in a tow truck going 140 mph, got hit by a guy in a jet barely surviving, and got help from a modder doing a heist with me, very amusing"

"I always love to play gta when I was kid until now, you can do whatever you want and do some missions with your friends. comforting while play alone and fun when play together"
Best all-round game ever
I'm pretty sure my rockstar account somehow got stolen. Can't play a game that I own because the rockstar launcher says it's now linked to a different email that I'm not even associated with.
fun game online but rockstar makes so much money and gives nothing back for the fans in online service game

"I loved this game when it first released on consoles in 2013-2014. Now it's a bittersweet reminder of Rockstar's fall from grace, as the campaign is lackluster and GTA Online grows worse every year"
good game/story

"Only online, story mode is rubbish."
"Great game,  I had this on my xbox but wanted to try mods so yeah this is great experience that wasnt stuck in 30fps"
I like the freedom the game gives me
i love shooting and running over people.
So Make Me HAPPY
Mass murder makes this game fun
A GOOD GAME
pretty bad compared to san andreas
"It's GTA, What else do I need to say?"
"Shoot people, commit war crimes, make money, waste money, repeat"
ITS A FUN GAME TO PLAY ALONE BUT WHEN YOUR WITH YOUR FRIENDS ITS EVEN BETTER

"If you buy this game at 2023, it's still worth the money. Why? it's 2013 game with 2015 graphics, AI and Tech. Then why should you purchase this? Well surprisingly it's for the ONLINE part of GTA V that's makes it worth the buck. Now I know GTA vets will be pissed off at this comment. But truth is as a beginner in 2023 you'll be smashed with 10 years worth of content. So you'll be overwhelmed with how much this game has to offer. And in my opinion the freedom & abundance of choices is what makes this the Best GTA game ever made.  And yes in my opinion GTA V story > GTA 4 story, because story is aware about and embraces the dual nature of characters and leaves it upto the player to choose their perspective. This is something GTA 4 couldn't do it properly."
I love the fact that you can kind of do whatever you want in this game and its very fun. 100% recommend for people abov the age of 15.
"yes man,i like that but i wanna more interesting weekly update and more easily to make money,but is so goood,love u<3"
10/10 would wait for  more than 11 years for a sequel again  Good game. Online is a mess tho.
"sunt mic si fraierut, ia ma de mana miau"

Banned me for cheating 10/10 would not reccomend
good god this is one of the best games i have ever played (btw rockstar where the HELL is gta VI)
"Do you like getting your ass kicked, if yes play gta online on low level youll sure get your ass kicked :D"
uh yea good game but gta 4 isb better
"Very fun game, it can sometimes be to grindy, or players are ruining your expirience, but overall i would give it 9/10"
It is hella fun and i reccomend it to everyone whoe DOESNT have a strict mum:)
boobs heheh
"Rockstar couldn't properly make a game if their lives depended on it. And now they want to make a 6?! Haven't fixed ANY of their other games, but yeah, make a new one. Worthless money grabbing fucks, just like any other AAA company. STOP WASTING YOUR MONEY UNTIL THEY DECIDE TO FIX THEIR SHIT YOU ALREADY PAID FOR!!!"
its fine. just hard to play the game with modders. but still fun! :)
One of the most beautiful electronic art

So many hackers.not recommend Online public.Rockstar  never help  you. single player is best .
its gta nikka
The best Rockstar game of 2013 But when will the new GTA come?
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
its good game and can play with friends .
"Even though the game is good its now full of hackers / modders and griefers, i would recommend playing in a friends only server"

It's 2023 still it is one of the best game I have ever played I will recommend this game to all and we even can play roleplay and stuff with freinds
9.5/10

"very sophisticated game, except when it comes to the cops. if you are a new player and you have 3 stars or up, you will die"
racist
THe best game
"This game gave me a lot of emotions, both positive and negative. While I was going through the story line, I was worried about the fate of the characters of the game, which was developing very rapidly in an extraordinary way. The game gives the player a choice of ending the game by either killing one of their friends or saving them. Online of this game is fun, playing with your friends in different fun modes, but there are also story missions. I liked one of them, ""Doomsday"", which is divided into 3 acts, because the events there are rapidly developing, the main characters are betrayed by a crazy AI owner who is trying to destroy the world, but we prevent him from doing it. But in this game there are enough bugs, desynchronizations, some of which are very old and not resolved. Anyway, the game is good!"
Dog ass
Games pretty good frfr
best game oi ever seen
[b] Why did I move here? [/b]  [b] I guess it was the weather. [/b]
For a game released in 2013 it was far ahead of it's time

Cars cannot be saved in garage. It always go missing. Spending & buying a car is useless. Customizing characters is also not very satisfied.
i hate it !!!
effef
help life :(
Fun until its not
ITS GREAT GAME
Sweeeet!- Eric Cartman South Park
Heists and lots of fun with friends involved.

how can i play it when stupid Rockstar launcher won't let me start it :(
fun af kinda sucks you need rank for alot of the stuff tho
Great game. Played GTA 5 on the Playstation. Prefer PC. Faster load times and I can play on the go with my laptop. Can't do that on  the PS4

"good ass game and always has been, just has a distinct art style i've grown really bored of (and online sucks), can't wait for gta 6"
"This game made me so violent grrr. videogames are bad for you!!! seriously though, a must play. Although, you have already played GTA V if you werent born yesterday. Get ready for an extremely toxic online community though. 9/10"
played it for a couple hours straight every day and then completely forgot about it.  the game does not start up properly and for that reason i can never play it again ever.  there is probably an easy fix but honestly i dont care.  i want a refund.  10/10 would reccomend
yes😁
its okay i guess. pretty cool angy man who yells.
i love killing pedestrians
Too grindy. Good cars tho play it anyway.
goody good for being old
"Honestly a great game overall with the updates, the patches and dlc make the game online more interesting"
"Story mode is a timeless classic. Online is really fucked, riddled with hackers, and glitchy as hell. Also the snack and armor system in online is one of the worst healing systems in any video game ever. Overall fun to play with friends but I feel bad for all the solo online players."
silly fun gta
"just play the singleplayer campaign, it will bring you more joy than online ever will"
This game fire ong
I CAN COMMIT MASS MURDER 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
gta online sucks so bad og i8942375u9234
I've been trying to make the game work for about 2 days now and nothing seems to work. A multi-billion dollar company can't fix a launching issue
this game is nice i love running people over and shooting them
its gta...i mean what else can i say?

"Servers are complete trash. Can barely connect to gta online and when you do actually get in, dont ever try to go into one of your player own building because, drum roll please, you crash! Modders basically run the sessions, servers are a trash fire and the new content is literally 2mil honda civics. The fact the offer gta+ should be a fuckin crime considering the nature of their product. 10/10 do not recommend.  Edit: 28 hours later nad still garbage servers. I am uninstalling and will not be buying gta 6. Great work rockstar, you money grubby fucks."
respect kendama
oppressor mk2
this games sucks
IT HAS GUNS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Is good game.
dsaccasc
story is great but online is way too grindy and is full of hackers and level 400 players who kill new players because they have no life
This game is like if you let the intrusive thoughts win
idk i js had fun
Great game in general. Multiplayer in 2023 is questionable no doubt there will be modders in every lobby. But I would recommend anyone who has any modding knowledge or wants to get into modding (Singleplayer) should give this game a try. I have been putting my last 40 hours in game using the LSPDFR mod and it gives this game so much more replay ability.
it sure is the fifth one alright
This game is unplayable due to modders and cheaters.
cars go vroom or something. weed too.
This game is mad fun when you just wanna grind and have a great time with friends. Although this game may be frustrating especially with its weird physics its still a great game!
online takes ages if it actually loads
melhor
Story mode seems okay but the online mode is great
a bit boring after 200h
ROCKSTAR IS MONSTER EAT ALL GAMES HISTORY wait for VI
its a cool game and fun
Old ass piece of shit has so many glitches. kinda fun though
it has a strip club
bas
the strip club is very realistic
BEST OF THE BEST
Loading Speed is very Low in Online Mode
JFHGJ
dont recomend could only put in 2 hour over all
Its a nice fun game.
good giame

"Best game ever, i prefer story time but i love playing online too. I recommend playing this game!"
"The Rockstar Launcher and DRM is terrible. Online is unplayable with extreme loading times and heavily pay to win. Singleplayer is pretty enjoyable once you get past the 5 minutes of loading, modding is pretty fun too.  Only buy it if you want to play FiveM, otherwise you're better off ""sailing the seven seas"" ;)"
sdfa
old af
Worst sever ever
dtw g fdgfd gfdfg
it's good (i only bought the game for the strip club)
"Great for lspdfr, epic games is good but steam is the goat:)))"
hella modders if you want fun download fivem when you get gta 5
"I beat this game way back in 2013 on Xbox 360. Still a great story, worth a play-through for those who haven't done so. Its been kicking around for so long for a reason."
Its a game!

Keen for gta 6
would 100% buy this just to rocket launch cars for a wanted level then rocket launch the cop helicopters out of the sky
Funny Game With Friends
"refunded, played the game years ago when it came out on xbox one, have since built a pc but cant play because rockstar refuses to unlink my old rockstar account that i no longer have access too.  they said that if i unlinked the account the game would never be able to play online, not going to play around with the AAA game companies anymore they make billions of dollars off of us and cant even pay for proper customer service.  this is after having to argue with them for THREE YEARRS to convince them that i own my copy of rdr2, which of course i preordered like a dumbass  TLDR Rockstar is a shitty company and you shouldn't support them"
yeah fivem dope
game very fun omg pls buy it give rockstar money more support so 6 comes out fast
Vey sexy Waiting for gta6

May not be the best GTA in the history of GTA. It remains the G.o.a.t when it comes to graphics and online gameplay
very funn
i mean cmon its gta 5
i can get head and steal hookers money
The game still great despite the game almost run out of milk. It still the same PS3 game i did play years later and still amazing game! but the Rockstar launcher! God that shit is gross!
i can listen to hifumi daisuki while committing mass murder this is a great game

cool game for  Rockstar fans
sometimes I just drive around Los Santos to feel something...
Nice Gem bruhh..
masarap
it s like crime but skibidi toiket
this game wants to make me dip my balls in acid and cut it with a rusted knife infused with Bubonic plague.  10/10 totally recommended for you to try this game :)
"Can't sing high enough praise for this game. Clearly a work of passion from a hard working team of enthusiastic developers. Don't be foolish and mistake it for a cash grab, that would be ""unfair"". Years of neglect are clearly demonstrated from the moment you connect to a ""Vanilla"" multiplayer server. But fret not FiveM to the rescue... just overlook the recent acquisition by the infamous Rockstar as I'm certain they won't screw with that... right?!?!"
it a good game but way more better if put mods on there
i love this game so much]`
this game is all good and i played it fully like 10 times on diferent types of devices but that aint the problem when i first downloaded this game and payed 20 dolars for it on steam i finished the story mod and decided to hop on online mod it was all good but 2 3 days later i wanted to hop on it takes time to open from loading screen and it says [you are attemting to acces gta servers on altered version of this game please come back to gta v ] how am i using an altered version of the gamee if i bought it directly from the store
"I probably only spent 150 hours on this, the rest was all idle time for my nightclub business. This is the game I'm most embarrassed of my playtime regardless. Red Dead 2 is better in every way."
Driving is epic
i like running over pedestrians
the strip cub and the whores
game pantek
Has floral shirts and aviators. All I need.
AAA title
Cool game when it came out in 2013. Only have this on the PC to play FiveM servers..   Waiting for GTA 6
This game is a legend
big titties
All of the possibilities!
its a WWWW
"Still fun looks great, basically a driving sim at this point ."
Pretty good game but Gex is better.

Women are destructable
Easily the best game for 2010-2020...
FIX YOUR HACKED GAME
"GTA 5 online.  Kill on sight, kill on respawn,  kill on respawn,  Killed by airplane with missiles. attempted 5 missions and 4 crashed the game.  Might like the game on private servers but you can't focus on anything because people kill you to much.  Shot an attacker in the head and they beat me to death with a pipe after shooting her.  Game was a gift from a friend with a private server.  Don't get for online."
yay butthole
its full of adventure
One of the best games in the series besides San andreas
It's not part 4... but still good.
waiting for grand theft auto IV no point of buying this game will get bored of it asap lmao

"I repurchased this game again for the 5th time. xbox 360,xbox one,ps5,the epic store and now finally on steam. 10 years ... it will be ten years in less than a month. If you make a good game people will play it and buy it over and over. this game doesn't need a review. I would continue on but i have to go buy skyrim again."
this game is ass I'd rather play flappy bird for the rest of my life

this game is just the best fun and you can play with other players it so fun
"Truly a masterpiece. Not too many game developers can write such hyper specific stereotypical characters as Rockstar. The gameplay, story, replayabiliity, progression, itemization and fun factor are all 10/10. The only thing that is lacking is the ability to make money to buy all to amazing things in the shops. It's way too grindy and encourages people to purchase the shark cards."
8Y`
"gotta love the godmode's, hackers, and modders in every lobby. REALY difficult to sell cargo and make money with all the griefers who just obliterate you with orbital cannons. story mode 9/10 very good, online is horrible, only way to play is in invite only sessions but thats realy boring and isolating. reccomend it if your playing online with friends who can either protect and help you or if you like the loneliness of invite only, but story mod is great if your buying for that reason"
"Been trying for a while to enjoy this game, and I can't. I will certainly never recommend anyone actually get this. Even if you were at literal gunpoint and told to buy it, it is not worth it.  - AI 100% aimbots to compensate for terrible (or lack thereof) design. Getting one or two-shot by a meth head who is *barely* wearing pants from 2 blocks away, blind fire, with a pistol, gets really fucking old fast. Getting swarmed by enemies that can see through objects and nail you with impossible precision is a joke. People that defend this are on actual drugs. For the essentially unlimited funding this game had to develop, they barely thought about what was balanced or fun.  - Combat is stupid. Defenders of this trash will say ""it's realistic"" while flying an oppressor jetbike and being unkillable (hacks that Rockstar does nothing about). It leaves little to the imagination to WHY some people get those hacks in the first place. To enjoy the fucking game, even at other's expense, which the game encourages you to do anyway.  - Players are 99% toxic. Good luck finding anyone in public lobbies who isn't a prick. The game rewards bad behavior. Literally. ""Good for you not being a prick. Here's $2000. By the way, grief those players and you'll make twenty times that."" Only met a couple cool people in online, it's a mess.  - Lost interest in the story for single player. NPCs with godlike aim, killing me immediately, and no amount of ""health increases"" or armor matters. The armored Kuruma is the only way to make most things possible, let alone fun. Still, because the devs are stupid, sometimes you will be killed by enemies which have absolutely no way to hit you, armor, building walls, doesn't matter. This system solely exists to waste your time and money. Armor, at best, takes one pistol shot. MAYBE something else but you will never notice. It's immediately gone by some dipshit firing blind a mile away. Fun.  - Everything revolves around shark cards. Every aspect of playing, making money, is designed by an idiot so you get impatient and buy a shark card to skip the gameplay to earn it so you can buy the thing you want.  - If you haven't gotten the picture by now, nothing more I can add will get through to you. Just stay away from it. Or don't, and be miserable.  Do not support this shit heap. It's made a gajillion dollars and me never supporting them ever again will not even register in these asshole's wallets. Do not spend money on this. Ever. There are far cheaper and more entertaining things to do to make you hate life.  Fuck this game."

good environment
Can't play without social club and captcha is pain in the ass F u
pretty fun :D
i hate you rockstar.
gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood i love killing hookers
"Oh you wanted to play the game you paid for? TOO BAD! Get ready for Rockstar Social updates, sign ins, wrong passwords for heaven knows what reason, solving ""I am not a robot"" puzzles, signing updated EULAs and a good 20 minutes of dealing with garbage before having the privilege of being bombarded with GTA online ads just to play the offline story mode. Piece of sh-t company."
graphic and the gameplay is amazing
very fun game one of the best games of all time
It's amaizing game.I'm waiting GTA 6 eagerly!
cooolll
I hate the Opressor II. Booo to you if you're using this.
A very good open world game
Social Club Launcher is a joke. Next Rockstar products I just Torrent so I can actually play whenever I want. Also what they did to the Trilogy is a joke.
its a amazing game to play with other people like friends that u know who has it and plays it
it feels real but it could feel even realer
i lovee ittttt rockstar love youuuuuu (;
cool game very entertaining

"hey its not like a review but like a beginners guide to make money in gta online  So your main objective is to buy the Kosatka sub for 2.2Mil. And that 2,2mil,youll earn by doing heists.but first youll already have 1mil since i think everyone get the criminal starterpack for free. so heres what you get for free 1.1mil from criminal starter pack 2.500K if you enable 2 factor authentication in your rockstar account  So you still need 700k. If you want to do it by your own then run apartment heists.You can do it by either going to ur house and then starting one or just use the quick join from ur phone.Id suggest you to do the apartment heists since they pay you decent for the time of the mission.  Or if you want to do it the quick way then... make a reddit account and go to r/heistteams  then ask ppl to run heist for you,there are some really generous ppl there so you may get lucky there.also there are many other ways by doing the pistol quest,completing the flight school,weekly time trail etc  but this is the pc version.this game is filled with filthy motherfucking hackers which are desperate to ruin your day.so either play in a public lobby in passive mode or just play in a private session  and sorry for bad english"
ulala~ game mantapz

Great game when there ain't any hackers in the lobbies... Love that you can now run businesses in a friend only or closed lobby now to avoid being trolled by hackers.. gta 6 needs to come soon...

what do you need to know the best game obviously
yes good very cool cool me so coo gang gang
this game is too good to be true
Lowkey the singleplayer is an underrated masterpiece.  Online can be fun with friends but is full of bs and pay to win
"we all know gta, if you are thinking about getting it but not sure hears my review: online is grindy sole, online is funny with friends even whilst grinding, story mode is really good and worth playing. one thing to note is that you do a lot of hours without realising especially when mucking around"
FIRE!!!!!!!!!
经典永不过时！ 引人入胜的故事剧情、代入感极强的人物心理，让玩家久久不能忘怀。 多年后我决定重新打开这款游戏，这次我选择做个好人。  The classic will never go out of fashion! The compelling storyline and immersive character psychology will stay with the player for a long time. Years later I decided to reopen the game and this time I chose to be a good guy.
"Had a total of 2000 hours on my online character record. So ummm,,,,, gotta stay alive for gta 6 for PC"

"I've played this game for 550 hours, 543 of those are online. Up until about 3-4 months ago this game was great for the GTA Online portion.  GTA Online has become so infested with modders/hackers that 3 out of 4 sessions you join have you getting hunted down by some idiot in godmode getting killed repeatedly until you have to leave your session, only to join that session and have you and everybody else in the lobby get blown up from a guy 50 miles away using a mod menu. You then leave THAT session, and get teleported to the other end of the map just to get killed repeatedly by another idiot in godmode, then the next session somebody using a mod menu disconnects you and everybody else from the lobby with the push of a button, then you have some guy cashdrop you a huge amount of modded money without asking/against your will and get YOUR account flagged as a potential hacker even though you're one of the legitimate players. Get the picture?  Honestly, if Rockstar did something about the hackers and modders this review will turn to an enthusiastic yes, but as of the last 3 months I haven't been able to do anything at all due to the sheer amount of modders. I'm talking spending 30-40 minutes out of every hour played session hopping to find one without a greifing modder.  Rockstar, fix your platform, this is absolutely ridiculous."

"How could I evaluate a game like this that's PERFECT in all aspects?  Grand Theft Auto V is such a legendary game. The masterpiece of the century. I'm really happy that I'm living with this game contemporarily.  Also, GTA5 is the only game I've memorized whole game maps. Since released in 2013, it has no competition! Since then, many open world games have been released, but there have been no games like GTA5!"

"the game makes it impossible to change your password or log in in general if you had not been on for so long that you forgot your password, or even if you do change your password it wouldn't be for the same account so you will still not be able to get in anyway."
This is the best game ever. It's a little tedious when you first start at level 1 but when you get more rp it's suuupeerr fun!! 100% recommend.
ITS GTA V
"This ridiculous game designer demands that you install an extra launcher, that will purposefully get your email wrong meaning you can't play the game unless you go back and uninstall the game through the Rockstar Games Launcher and install it through there, meaning you will have lost a lot of time to get the game to work  **** Rockstar"

"The story campaign is fun to play through, online is a horror show for legit players, almost no point of even playing online unless your okay with people who only know how to mod and hack. Makes missions and doing anything multiplayer pointless though. And it doesn't appear Rockstar even knows where to begin to remove these modders and hackers. If you call out the hackers in game they have the ability to just crash your game so reporting them is also useless."

"Yes this game is very good and you probably know that already but there are some simple things that do anger me sometimes, and the long cutscenes.... pfffff. By the timr you enter the lobby gta 6 will have come out!"
It's simply the greatest game of all time.
"best game ever, pls release gta vi"
Very fun ngl
Best game in the world. i would highly recommend this game.
awsome game i love it
Gta online need anti cheat
vey good game
best game ever for freely to move everywhere
Honestly hate the fact the cayo perico heist has been messed with so r* can groom little kids into buying their shitty shark cards. The newer dlc has been atrocious to say the least with either having little content or none at all.
"[b]It's a shame that Rockstar can't read the anti-gaming law with understanding. This law prohibits playing with real money or virtual money that can be exchanged back for real money. Neither of these is the case in GTA V, so it is incomprehensible that games such as roulette etc. are blocked in Poland. There is no law applies even though we can buy GTA$ with the Shark card because the Shark card is a good and/or service. By playing we can lose the virtual cash we get as part of this service. As long as Rockstar does not allow the exchange of tokens or GTA$ into currency (Zlotys, Dollars, Euros, etc.) there is no question of violating the Anti-Gambling Act because there is no physical gain and therefore nothing to charge tax on. The purpose of the law is to seal the collection of tax, because before the law there were a lot of points where the profit had the person who placed the Slots did not pay tax on it, as well as the player did not pay tax.[/b]"
its coo i guess even tho it taking 10+years for gta6
Wouldn't reach this many hours if I didn't enjoy playing the GTA V.
"Awesome game, looking forward to 6"
just do it pls
This game is a steaming pile of ****!!! These devs are so F****** money hungry and completely dont care about thier fan base. Rockstar games has lost lost all talent in making games and have done nothing but become another triple A Bulls*** company. Absolutely garbage company!!!!!!!!!!

"great online but so many f moders if they add a anti cheat or sm it would be perfect but i cant recommend at its current state,"
"before you read my review, this is my alt because I play story mode, my actual account as over 1400+ HRS on it,  A Bumpy Ride  Rating: ★★☆☆☆  So, I just have to vent about my time with GTA 5,  especially the online part. Strap in, folks, because this isn't going to be a joyride.  I don't know from where to start but... here we go,  First of all the online mayhem:  GTA 5 online? More like GTA Cheater's Paradise. The place is swarming with players using mod menus, making it feel like a lawless wasteland. Rockstar's effort to clean this mess? Well, it's non-existent. Plus, the in-game prices are so absurdly high a car that you can buy for 100K is worth of 4M  Recent updates? Yeah, they've made the game feel like a wild circus, not in a good way.  Server are too slow, buggy, and laggy The servers are terrible and buggy Trying to enjoy a heist mission? Prepare for a chaotic mess of crashes and glitches. It's almost like they want you to give up,,,  and don't get me started with the customer support, its a nightmare in Itself  My online account had a problem that basically kept me from playing. When I finally reached out to their support, it felt like shouting into the void. Response times were painfully long, and when they did reply, their help was about as useful as a chocolate teapot. ""did you try to delete and reinstall the game?"" To top it all off, they had the audacity to mark my ticket as ""resolved"" when, in reality, it was anything but resolved. Talk about frustrating.  so far the only thing I liked is the story mode, The only saving grace in this GTA 5 ordeal is the story mode. It's a genuine masterpiece, with no cheaters in sight to ruin the fun. If you're thinking about diving into this game, I'd strongly advise sticking to the story mode and steering clear of the online chaos. GTA 5's story mode is a gem, but the online mode is a wild mess of cheaters, wallet-draining prices, and a customer support team that needs a serious upgrade.   Rockstar, if you're listening, it's high time to fix these issues and give us the game we all deserve, Disgusting company that doesn't respect it's customers.  ★★☆☆☆ 2/5  BAD EXPERIENCE."

The standard for sandbox games. Nothing will ever top it until Rockstar decides to release 6.
"This game on xbox or playstation...100% play it. The game on PC is just garbage. So many hackers and modders it just isn't fun. Best you can do is go to a private match, but I enjoyed playing with and against real players. Rockstar doesn't care about it because gta 6 is almost here."

"T.P.I for life! After years of wanting to play this game, I finally robbed my country's central bank to purchase it. Now that our economy has tanked, I can say it was worth it. I'm not sure about the online mode, it was too overwhelming for me and I had RDR2 lined up which just seemed to be way more fun than this so I can't speak about it. The single-player mode was amazing though, coming from GTAIV there is a lot to love save for the unnecessarily violent cops."

just try disable 2-FA and you will see what a dogshit company is like u have to wait 2+ days for a simple remove 2-FA link(i waited 4) and if u wait more then a day or two nope its invalid now so i guess ill go fuck myself
"I've been playing GTAV on and off since it was first released, and I've been playing a lot more recently (since they opened up most of the missions to play in a private session). I basically stopped playing for a few years because it was impossible (for me, anyway) to find a session where other players would more-or-less leave me alone to do what I wanted to do. Since they will now let me play most missions in a private session, it's been great. If I could find a few friends to play with - a bit difficult for me as I'm an old guy who plays mostly in the afternoons in the eastern United States - I'd be interested in doing the Heists. Oh well, maybe one day.   The ""Story"" is much different from the ""Online"" play, and both are fun. I did finish the Story (I didn't get every last achievement, but that's okay), and now I play almost exclusively online. Note that this game deserves it ""Mature"" rating, mostly for the language, but also for some of the innuendo and some artifacts.   The game mechanics are great! I'd say they're among the best I've seen in any game. It would be nice to see RockStar use the same mechanics in a different story in a different setting. Hint, hint.  If you enjoy FPS games with varied missions and mission types, open world play, and great game mechanics - and you don't mind the language (particularly in the ""Story"" version) - I highly recommend this game."
best of the best!

Grand theft auto is a unique franchise more known for its iconic ways of stealing this game is very worth the cash I played over 500 hours and enjoy the game for people who see this review I will say it is addicting and will be your favourite game only thing i don't like is grand theft auto Vi wait. :) 10/10 game recommend.

"Fantastic open world game but on line is absolute trash. In my first 2 hours of on line playing I was in the tutorial and I had selected ""Passive Play"" because I only got on line to play some of the fantastic race tracks people have made. I was killed 3 times within 5 minutes by someone who magically drove through a cement wall into a clothing store while they had a God mode and began blowing everything up around us with an rpg and I saw his body go flying and immediately re-appear where he originally shot from then he pointed it right at me and killed me then teleported to me when I respawned and did it again. I had a ""Bounty"" on me by no one and was being tracked no matter what I did.  Amazing single player game, ABSOLUTE TRASH ON LINE PLAY."
"Stepping into GTA 5's gameplay world is like being thrust into a wild and chaotic adventure. The freedom to explore a meticulously designed open-world city is exhilarating. Whether I'm cruising in a stolen car, engaging in heart-pounding shootouts, or participating in meticulously planned heists, every moment feels immersive. The seamless character-switching mechanic adds depth, allowing me to experience the story from different perspectives. And when I'm not following the main plot, there's a plethora of side activities, from skydiving to golf, ensuring I'm never bored. GTA 5's gameplay is a rollercoaster of action, exploration, and unexpected hilarity that keeps me hooked for hours on end."

"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is"
"This game is fun - I like it.  But, a recent update has rendered it unplayable for me:  Before a recent update, Linux and Windows support was flawless.  Now, Grand Theft Auto V is not playable for me on either Linux (Proton) or Windows (native).  On the former, I experienced it occasionally loading and working, other times it doesn't.  It would often get past ""Processing Vulkan Shaders"" and then not launch the Rockstar Games Launcher.  Some other times, it would crash after the loading screen (at about 2-3 stars in the top-right).  On very rare occasions, after restarting Steam, and letting Vulkan shaders process, it would sometimes actually launch.  For the latter, it was fine, until changing my graphics settings, at which point the game loaded and played at less than 1fps, where I was unable to change any settings back at all.  On Linux with Proton (which virtualizes the game!) I was usually around 70-80fps.  Main menu screens being impossible to navigate makes no sense here.  A few hours from initially writing this review, GTA Online is able to pass through all the loading screens, but then immediately crashes when getting ingame.  Fun.  I understand that not all users will experience the aforementioned issues, but it might be something to be wary of, especially if you are looking into running the game through Proton.  Along with those, I still have some other gripes with the game:  The menus also feel clunky and incomplete, and some options are located in hard to find places.  GTA Online lobbies are infested with cheaters all the time - going anywhere but a private or friends only session is simply not a fun experience.  GTA Online's loading times are also extremely long a lot of the time - sometimes taking 2-3 minutes to get into a lobby.  This could be an internet issue, but I'd describe my internet to be pretty average and alright.  This game is still fun once you get things going and I would like to recommend it if I was able to get it working a larger amount of the time - playing GTA Online with my friends is one of my favourite things to do an I enjoy even just being in a lobby and VC with them, with eachother occasionally jumping in and bombing one another and everyone bursting into laughter.  And even playing solo is still a fun experience, at least for me, stealing cars and shooting guns is fun.  PS: If anyone can help me fix my mentioned issues then feel free to reach out.  EDIT: Thought it'd be worth mentioning: Intel i5-12400f AMD RX 6600XT 16GB RAM  EDIT2: I have no idea what I did, but it works now!  I think it's because Windows randomly decided to update and possibly did my graphics drivers.  Could have been an issue with that.  Still very strange."
its gooood
awesome.....!
"The game is good, somehow checkpoints work incorrectly by advancing the player to the next stage of the mission while the player fails on a previous stage. Graphics is stunning even at the end of 2023.  Definitely recommend playing!  P.S: Social club suck"
Is good :thumbsup:
nothing that i can say just luv it
"i love every bit of this game, its what every game should be, FUN."
i am having trouble logging in with social and its telling me its having trouble automatically logging me in to my account using an email that is not mine nor exist because its fake and when i ask for support they ignore me
"for a game made in 2013 its decent, nothing outstanding and nothing too horrible, a major issue for me though is that there are only 69 story missions and so i completed the story in ~3 days"
"Loading screen simulator Bots are better that you simulator Broke man's simulator GTA 6 waiting room simulator Cheaters and modders simulator Third party Andy simulator Imagine you still playing this game on 2023 simulator   If you love Pandas and other animals please leave a like, rate and give an award? <3"

"Single player game = YES! GTA Online = NOOOOOO!   I have way more hours in GTAV than what is shown on my account as I have played since day 1 of it's launch on other platforms. That's part of the problem. I'll leave out the details but the reasons I say to avoid the online part is because it's the most toxic multiplayer game in existence today. It started out good when they stayed within the bounds of the GTA universe but once they introduced game breaking flying bikes/cars/subs/nuclear missile heists/etc it was clear they only cared about the money.   Heists weren't even in the game at first and when they did get put in they weren't terribly unrealistic. But that's when Rockstar(RS) started their turn to greed and predatory shark card pushing. They nerfed payouts for nearly everything while increasing the cost of everything, in an attempt to slow down players getting too much money. Players could buy stuff with all the money RS was paying out in missions/heists and that didn't make people 'need' to buy shark cards. So they just kept adding more stuff at ridiculous prices while also requiring ridiculous storage facilities for these new vehicles and you couldn't even do any new heists unless you owned a certain vehicle/business, thus ultimately making the 'official' grind to get these things a p.i.t.a. Or, just as they expected, people started buying shark cards to compensate for their time which just spiraled out of control into an unrealistic experience that's so out of touch with the original release, RS just said ""oh well it's a different universe that takes place before the events of single player..."" B.S. The reason they haven't made GTA6 sooner is because the cow still had a LOT of milk left.   I don't want the other companies seeing the 'success' of RS as a sign to do the same treatment to their games. Sure you'll make money, but you'll lose a lot of players leading you to end up like RS pandering to whales that keep the game afloat."
comp
Game has stopped working!!

"It has graphics, it has murder, it has mayhem. Good times"
I lost all of my progress from xbox because i cant transfer to pc. Fuck this game
great game have played the story mode 20+ times on different platforms and have enjoyed it every time. only downside is the multiplayer because it filled with modders
"my daily release of dopamine includes running over innocent people, watching the girl on the loading screen, and finally, last but not least the strip club, sadly they removed the gay strip club though. However, it is most definitely a must buy"
this fucking game is trash! every time i play it wont let me so i am quitting GTA V forever!
YOU CAN RUN PEOPLE OVER AND OVERHEAR THEIR JUICY GOSSIP WHILE THEY'RE ON THE PHONEE!! VERY POG GAME U CAN ALSO SHOT INNOCENT PEOPLE WALKIN BY BUT ITS NOT AS FUN AS RUNNING THEM OVER!!! GET GAME YES
"great game, gta for life.."
"GTA V and GTA Online with mods is definitely one of the best games on PC hands down. I remember playing it on PS3 long before it made it to Steam and I have so many great memories of that time. The modding capabilities it has now just make it that much more enjoyable. Doing co-op with my friends is such a blast, and I don’t think there’s any other game on PC that can provide the same kind of experience as GTA V and GTA Online. I highly recommend it to everyone who haven’t tried it yet, and I’m sure they won’t be disappointed."
so kewl

Be the criminal you have always wanted to be...
"I literally cannot play the game. The game made my social club account, so I have no idea what my info is. Now the game wants me to enter the email and password. Rockstar and Steam wont help me. I am so sick of it, they wont give me a refund, either side, so I am stuck with a $60 game on my Steam account that I cannot play. If anyone can help me, that would be great, I will cash app whoever gets my game running $30. Snapchat is Mark.boop for anyone willing to try and help."
Booooooooooooooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrriiing. lets see the next one already.

"To preface: I do not recommend GTA Online. Try FiveM instead.  This is one of the best selling games of all time, for good reason. The singleplayer story is nearly 10 years old but still holds up as one of the better action games/movies of all time. Play it, enjoy it, and if you want to handle multiplayer, please install FiveM and join one of the servers there."
absolute shit
Go to the shoe store. You won't regret it.
thhe game is very realistic and i like it
this game is like 10 years old how do you not have it?

great game but i have to buy more money in this game
You Know All Of The Things!! Just Fun..
"Pretty Fun, lots of modders though"
made me more suicidal than a ex r6 player
little boring but fun most of the time
Why I need to say something about this game quality? Everyone knows already!
Lots of replay value and addicting. The grind for me is fun.
"really really fun game, even online mode, but as of late wayyy too many hackers and cheaters, so you just have to get lucky with your server or use an invite only session (which is no where near as fun). one way to protect your self from the hackers is to download protection scrips and use them but probably not worth it if you only just bought the game as this game is like 50 aud. so in short i don't recommend or condone hacking and also only get GTAV if you really really want it, otherwise just wait for GTA 6 to come out. (I only said recommend because the game is still fun despite the hackers and whatnot)"
VERY VERY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
id expect this kinda anticheat from an indie developer. great job
buy GTA 6
Enak aja lah ya mainnya santai
very cool B)

"Garbage game, spent all my time in loading screens and crashing. The little time I got to spend in game was ruined by invincible hackers spawn killing me."
ITS GTA ONLINE
unpredictable story mode!!!! it was fun playing this game :)
i got that sloppy in my whip
there's little to no new diferent things to do
Will no Start
its a bit fun
"This only about online:  You have 3 other friends and can play in private lobby = YES  I tried to play with random ppl in public lobby , give it two tries for aprox one month - dont have nerves for cheaters, hackers, spammers :-(, so solo = NO  ...........and last, this is just a minor , but if you are in restricted country, you have to use VPN to be able to use casino..................."
"My relationship with GTA V and GTA Online has been a real love-hate relationship. The story mode is pretty great and feels like a Hollywood action movie at times, and a dramedy at other times, lots of hilarious dialogue and memorable characters, gunplay is solid, vehicles are fun. I'd definitely recommend GTA V to someone that's looking for a solid singleplayer game, not to mention the availability of total conversion mods like LSPDFR, which let you play as Police or Emergency Services in a semi-simulator like way.  GTA Online, though? I hate GTA Online, but I also love it. It's a great social game, and a great way to kill time if you're playing with friends, lots of ridiculous stuff is possible, but playing solo definitely gets boring and repetitive pretty quick, but still most of the 3300+ hours I've spent with the game have been GTA Online, so they must be doing something right."
"Good game, just run people over"
oooooo coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Nice and shine
"The (online) game is filled with hackers and modders using god-mode and other cheats to make the game unplayable for you. When you attempt to report them, they ""intercept"" those requests and block them, they can then crash your game...spoof your name and in some reported cases...even get you banned for their activities (because of the name spoofing).   I've had my game crashed soo many times that its just not worth playing anymore. You can grind the game all you want to try and experience the game further but someone can just take it all away from you in a heartbeat. Rockstar does nothing to address these issues so the issue just continues to get worse.   There are non-stop advertisements in each online session for these modding websites and for purchasing insane amounts of in game money through them. It would be so easy for rockstar to fix this but it must be more profitable for them to allow it to go on. The only way to truly report players is from the rockstar social club where there is no guarantee your submissions are even reviewed.    If this is how rockstar handles their biggest cash cow, how are we to expect GTA 6 to be any different?"
Insane
I always enjoyed playing GTA from the beginning. As a 80s baby I have watched the series do great things. I love running through the story line; it keeps you entertained and has tons of options. I recently got into playing it online with some friends and have found the open world with a group to be a great set up for gameplay. I'm making everyone get online to play now. so we have 3 or 4 crews running in one lobby. Great way to spend the day
i get run from the cops and rob people download this old game its worth it.
"good game, haven't slept in 3 days"
takes too long to load  (pls comment ways to reduce loading time)
NO DRAGONS 0/10
I like to kill people in this game. If you like killing people than I think you'd also like this game. Overall is pretty good. (:
I mean its GTAV... what else do I gotta say
i loved everything about this game! most of all i liked the online part of it more
"I like the way it goes about heists, and I wish there was more story mode. Also, the random events affecting story mode is fantastic. I do not like the gun play controls as much anymore. Too sticky."
remove the opressor mk2
This game should be rated to 3 year olds
Great game after so many years
this game is horrble don't buy this piece of shit game every time you load in it's either you get spam insta killed or the cheaters crash your game or break it i got a fucking 3060 and my game crashing...f2ggoggtttt
You can run this game on shitty school laptops

This game is so good but Rockstar is filled with degenerate retards that don't know how to fix their dumb fucking launcher and website because they are too busy milking people of a game that came out more than a decade ago.
no go d
best monkeyt game
"Overrated. I'm still surprised people even play online after the whole GTA+ fiasco, and how rockstar only knows how to add stuff when it makes them money instead of focusing on the bigger problem at hand. Cheaters, every single lobby you go to is filled to the brim with some kid using his free trainer making it miserable for everyone. I would talk about story mode but everyone nowadays buys GTA to play online so I won't bother."

"Listen up, you crazy bunch! Grand Theft Auto V ain't just a game, it's a full-on crazy ride that'll have your heart pounding like you just downed a jug of adrenaline. I'm talkin' 'bout a world where you can hijack cars, burn rubber like a maniac, and unleash havoc like a bat outta hell. And let me tell you, it's a damn blast!  From the moment you dive into Los Santos, you're smack dab in the middle of a chaotic playground that's fit for folks like me – misfits, lunatics, and downright insane individuals. Michael, Franklin, and that wild card Trevor bring a whole new meaning to the word ""chaos,"" and believe me, things escalate pretty damn quick.  You get behind the wheel of a stolen ride, slam that gas pedal to the floor, and the rush hits you like a shot of adrenaline straight to the veins. And let's talk heists – planning and executing those with a bunch of screwballs by your side? It's like conducting an orchestra of chaos, and I'm the goddamn conductor.  Los Santos, man. This open world is a masterpiece of madness. You got everything from pristine beaches to grimy back alleys, all ready for your brand of mayhem. And the attention to detail? It's like they read my mind. You can be a pilot, go play some damn golf, or raise hell in a strip club. It's a world tailor-made for a guy like me.  The story? Oh, the story is a rollercoaster that'll throw you for loops you never saw coming. Betrayal, lunacy, and plot twists that'll make your head spin. And those random nutjobs you meet along the way? Helping some wacko launch his drugged-up submarine? Yeah, that's just another day in Los Santos.  Graphics? Sounds? Radio stations pumping out twisted tunes? It's like being inside a chaotic fever dream. The only thing missing is the smell of burnt rubber and gunpowder. And damn it, I love every second of it. It's like living out the craziest fantasies without the real-world mess.  So, if you're looking for a taste of the wild side, if you want to dive headfirst into the lunacy and unpredictability, then Grand Theft Auto V is your golden ticket. It's a wild journey that'll have you grinning like a madman, cursing at the screen, and maybe questioning your sanity – all in the best way possible. Embrace the madness, you beautiful maniacs!"

"Lately (M27)my (M7)son has been in love with these ""Skibi Toilet"" things. He constantly asks me for robux just for the Skibi Toilet games he plays. He is quite literally infatuated with it. I think it is doing something to him, someone help me make him stop. I've even put a time limit on his IPad, and it's to the point where he somehow gets around the limit. JUST FOR SKIBI TOILET. I have been getting calls recently by my bank for fraudulent activity. Turns out it's just robux for his skibi toilet games. He has already spent over 50 dollars on these games and I don't think he's gonna stop. He already has my credit card memorized and I don't know how. I DON'T EVEN HAVE MY OWN CARD MEMORIZED, BUT A 7 YEAR OLD DOES! Someone please help me or tell me a way to get him to stop."
10/10 game been playing since the day it released and I'll keep playing even when GTA 6 comes out.
is gooood
Better than GTA 4 Online (SMD 4 Meat riders)

toxic but fun to drive in
Sram do paczkomatu
the game itself has been fun but the online content today is just a shadow of its former self. If you are a low level starter be prepared to be target practice by those who have spent far too long and amassed huge funds. so they can buy flying bikes and wipe you out in a second. Preventing you from accomplishing the most simple mission to earn money and rep. - This can be mitigated by playing solo so temper your expectations and don't overstretch and you should be fine.
Crime is a W
get a mod menu
MUy bien!
good good good
Best game according to me
too many loading and kick from game
THERE ARE NO COUGARS IN MISSIONS
"very fun game, you get to murder and run over people with cars, as well as fly planes in buildings, an not give a shit about the speed limit."
ITS A COOL GAME BUT WHEN U GET AT STRIP CLUB ITS SO COOL
Good game but gta 6 when?

"very kid friendly, if u are a nerd who cant get any beaches this is the game for u, tones of prosti everywhere its very kid friendly"

Can't imagine how good of a game it would be GTA 6 i can't wait till 2050
VERY VERY GOOD!
"this game is pretty awesome and revoluntionary, but the it's drawbacks are sooooooo disgusting and make it almost impossible to enjoy.  for starters: loading time is so long that you will most likely change your mind and switch to another game . i also must add that the amount of times that i've been playing in a session then randomly getting disconnected is horrifying. i really hope rockstsar fixes these issues (they most likely won't :))."
You should play this if you want to commit crimes against humanity or if you have mods like every other person
Spend more time at the strip club that playing the actual game
"Over 900 hours in this game and I wanna kill myself, would recommend if the player base isn't full of degeneracy (especially Sunday Griefer's). This masterpiece crashes when you'd least expect it, for example just driving around is enough to end your perfectly fine session. On this journey I have opened Task Manager well above the average number in a life time, because Rockstar Games is amazing!"
doggie ah game can't even join a game if you have any skill you'll be kicked by modders instantly so I recommend a mod menu for kick protection among others protections
I LOVE GETTING BUTT FUCKED BY OPPRESSORS 10/10
"I mean, yeah, it's GTA V. You know what this is, you know if you'll like it or not.   My only real complaint is that I'm forced to download and store the entirety of GTA Online, which I don't play. This makes the entire install over 100gb, which is not cool."
mutilating your balls is better than gta online
i hate it

"had to deliver 15 packs of weed in 30 minutes via water plane and theres hardly any time for it. i had 6 parcels left and 5 minute when my game froze for maybe the first time ever, at least the way it did. because it didnt stop responding on the computer, it just quit moving and after about 15 seconds it closed itself with no crash report or anything. youd think a game that took 8 years to make and has had 10+ years of updates afterward would be as dysfunctional as GTA V yet here it is."
JOD

"Filled with exploiters, RP is fine if you are lucky to get in a good server."
I have a level 400 account on GTA online for XB1 so my hours arent high on PC. But yeah I recommend getting it.
"great graphics , strippers , pole dancers what more could you want"

fun the only issue for me is money
"Nothing but a greedy company making a desperate effort anymore. Modders wreck lobbies without consequence, random people get banned daily, and nothing ever gets fixed. Save your money, and wait another decade for the sixth installment."
its a fun and good game to play if you like story line and also free play

"Got into online and saw my IP address, ISP, and location in the chat. I really feel like I'm at home"
its fun but lacks an easy way to get mods
murder is pog
takes me about 30 minutes to join a online lobby
very good game espically with online
very fun but i have no idea what im doing
criminal simulator
welp i must say the Story is alright i guess i liked it but well i did not find it that interesting i guess but the gameplay is a 10/10 for me  Now to Online  Online is kinda hard to play as a new player because of the god damn Flying bikes but its good with friends even more good like i love it but be warned of hackers in every two lobby's  Sorry for bad English im german and to Lazy to care
"The fifth main entry in the GTA series is very much more of the same type of gameplay and story that we're used to, now in a somewhat fresh setting. That said, my main complaint is that there isn't more of it, as completing the main questline left me feeling I still had much to explore, but no incentive to actually do so. I suppose the idea is to play online but as someone with little patience for multiplayer outside my circle of friends, I would have liked more single player content, even if they were autogenerated missions. 60 hours is still a decent playtime though, especially for a game that goes on sale a lot, so pick this up if you haven't already."
((:
Amazing story and game play. I love it.
good good goooooooooooooooood
When i played GTA 5 Fivem Its a great game! Nice fucking game. Rock ON!
goooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD GAME
Its an amazing game if you just want to be a badass then this is the game for you!
Rockstar has been really scummy lately.But this game is still my childhood.
Get the criminal enterprise starter pack. It's definitely worth it.
👎 No
I always love this game
Kinda copied watch dogs 2 but its all good
its GTA goods and bads I am not gonna have to list em you already know .
Love this game. Spent so much time on it playing on xbox and playing on PC is even better.   The cheaters suck tho and can be a problem sometimes.
^_^
Very good game but side missions sometimes are headache. Helicopter controls for PCs are very poor.
My car got stolen
i ran over a old lady
nc g
i like chimken
very good terrorist simulator
online the goat but my starter pack i bought didnt receive it so dont recommend buying criminal enterprise starter pack without contacting staff at rockstar but i made all the money i would've had because i did heist and jobs and missions but uh yes
It's cool but it takes long to load
"One of, if not, the greatest story game I have EVER played."
a free world to ruin with no consequences
"pay to play. pay to win, subscribe to win. your not gonna enjoy the game unless you spend more money"
"Amazing game, almost sandbox"

I'm impressed with how rockstar made so much money from this game
its fun kill evry one
"I just want to say that this game is not bad.  I do not like the two of the three protagonists, Trevor and Michael. There are too much driving in this game and it's kind of boring."
"Rockstar support sucks I got suspended and they will delete my charachter that i spent over 230 hours on and  there is nothing i can do about it and there is no reason that rockstart has to suspend me, so if you're planning to buy gta v, Never kill anyone in online because they will get pissed and report you and also, you have to read the terms of serveice 50 times before you start the game so that you can be at least 30% sure that you will not get suspended, But you will most likely get suspended anyway because the staff were probably bored or something.  I relly like the game but the support is just horrible"
1/3 of the player base is hacking.
Best game to have fun watch out for griefers
im never getting my drivers license
This is an amazing game. However Rockstar on the other hand is abysmal and makes a shitty social club launcher that doesn't work half the time and somehow manages to lose your 200hr account prevented you from logging into the game until you go through a multiple day support process to MAYBE get it back and just for that I would say don't buy this game and don't support a shit company.
"well, After 2,744.8 hours of game play, i can officially say that this game is...... complicated.   The actual game itself, single player,  is great.  The online version though.... while the most fun version of GTA, its also \completely over run with modders.  I would say that Rockstar has completely lost control of their online mode.....but i think its by design and they want the modders to play more then actual players.  I have reported HUNDREDS of modders and nothing ever is done about.  at this point I give up.  The online world of GTA is lost to the modders.  After 2,744.89 hours, I struggle to recommend this game.  It has some great moments and fun gameplay, but the online version......... too many modders / hackers............ .just ruins the whole of it.  sad rock star wont do anything about this.  play at your own risk. i recommend single player, or solo lobby for online."
glizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy edit i play every day
its the best game in my opinion
im a racist and i love this game
Interesting
f u
great game almost 400 hours reccomend  alot . but all griefers should kill themselves
JUST AMAZING defo reccomend
12/10 best game ive played in my entire life  ignore the negative reviews
"Personally, I Reccomend the Game. its story is Great, some romance, like Trevor being interested in a old lady, and or A 3-bit gangster Killing one of his mates. other than that the  Online feature. its alright, easy to rage at, because of flying bikes with missiles for christs sake and or just the average Military grade Jet fuckers Flying themselves into the ground like a Japanese pilot. in the wars"
lklklk
"Game has people with almost no clothing, 10/10"
fiya
fire game even after 200 years
it is great
American Dream Comes True
"so my friends got me into the game a long time ago. they dont play anymore. do you know who does play? the guy who spam killed the sessions' members, and i was being blamed for it. 2 minutes later, rockstar blocked my account. im on a steam deck, is that even capable of hacking gta online?? was a good 130 hours while it lasted though. seemed like everyone used me as a pin cushion for bullets, explosions and telling me to KMS(this was a popular message going out). i dont know why ppl say warcraft is toxic. they dont manipulate the game into making me the villain. cool story mode, wish i couldve gotten into online mode some more before my IP was blocked."
majestic game
nice and easy game
super hra
";,ol"
This game is a very very bad game don't buy it at all it's a stupid game full of bugs and annoying damn you Rockstar
shoe store was not shoe store
"Story mode is great, online isn't, sure content and activities is fun but getting stuck on the loading screen while entering apartments/garage ruins the fun"
once you learn to mod this becomes the best game you will ever play
"Pretty fun game until i try to get on after not being on for a week, come to find out i'm banned?"
i jl gdjbdsj f
"Used to love the game, and still do. This game unfortunately is practically unplayable. Unless you play the Story, you will be met with modders who will grief you every 10-15 minutes delaying any progress in the game. If you think playing in an invite only session is safe, think again. Modders are able to do almost anything now, control your character, cage you, constantly kill you, it makes the game unplayable. I've put probably 500+ hours in this game between console and pc, and I've come to the conclusion that GTA V on PC is just unplayable now and not worth the hours upon hours it takes to accomplish anything now."
this game i dont cant play again
i need steam points pls donate
Nothing more fun than fucking around in this game or playing heist with friends.
it gud buy it
AWEDAWD
zaza
can i have 10 dollars for criminal enterprise starter pack

This Game is the T!ts
Used to be good but all the futuristic shit ruined it
"online, NOOOO. single player, YESSSS. Fivem, yes. REDM, YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!! LSPDFR, YTESAHHAHAHAHH!!!"
so fun have to play
Runs beautiful on steam deck
Best Game I have ever Played 100% Getting GTA 6
"fun and addictive but you do have to worry about Modders/Hackers on online gameplay. its not always annoying but when you do run across a basement dwelling, baby dong, 40 year old who just happens to want to bug you.. its gets TOXIC.. sometimes you have no choice but to just close the game out, force close; restart the game. besides that.. this game is actually a great game."
4SR3R
Pretty fun should follow youtube to get started then go from there on your own
They will reset your account entirely for no reason on top of dealing with modders.
( ͡⚆ ͜ʖ ͡⚆)╭∩╮
"Cant log into my account anymore cant make a new one, game is dead"

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is an extraordinary masterpiece that stands as a testament to the open-world action-adventure genre. With its sprawling, meticulously crafted game world, engaging storyline, and endless opportunities for mayhem, GTA V offers an unparalleled experience that continues to captivate players years after its release.  Set in the fictional city of Los Santos, a stunning reimagining of Los Angeles, GTA V introduces players to a trio of protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking a new life; Franklin, a street-savvy hustler looking to escape his surroundings; and Trevor, a volatile and unpredictable criminal. The character-switching mechanic allows players to seamlessly switch between these three individuals, adding depth to the narrative and offering unique perspectives on the game's unfolding events.  One of the most remarkable aspects of GTA V is its breathtakingly detailed open world. Los Santos is a living, breathing entity teeming with activities, NPCs, and surprises around every corner. From towering skyscrapers to sun-soaked beaches, the city's diverse environments offer a sense of immersion that is truly awe-inspiring. The game's attention to detail, whether in the bustling city streets or the vast countryside, is a testament to Rockstar's dedication to creating a rich and vibrant game world.  The storyline of GTA V is a rollercoaster of heists, betrayals, and unexpected alliances. The interwoven narratives of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor provide an engaging and well-paced experience that keeps players invested in the outcome. The writing is sharp, darkly humorous, and often satirical, tackling social and political issues with a dose of Rockstar's signature irreverence.  Gameplay in GTA V is a harmonious blend of action, driving, and exploration. The sheer variety of activities is staggering – from high-stakes heists and intense shootouts to leisurely sports, races, and even simple pastimes like golf and tennis. The driving mechanics are polished and responsive, and the wide array of vehicles, each with its own distinct handling, adds to the immersive experience.  GTA Online, the game's multiplayer component, extends the life of GTA V even further. It provides a massive open-world playground for players to engage in co-op missions, competitive modes, and open-ended chaos with friends or strangers. The constant updates and additions keep the experience fresh and exciting, offering an ever-evolving online world to explore.  Graphically, GTA V still holds up remarkably well, showcasing intricate details in character models, vehicles, and environments. The game's soundtrack, radio stations, and voice acting are all top-notch, contributing to the overall atmosphere and immersion.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a masterclass in open-world gaming, combining an engaging narrative, a vibrant and diverse game world, and a plethora of activities that cater to every type of player. Its longevity is a testament to its enduring appeal, and even years after its initial release, GTA V remains an essential title that stands as a shining example of Rockstar Games' unparalleled craftsmanship."
probably?
i love this game plus mods :)
vvn cakda shtoa veeka re they home yet vychislav natoolia rockyyy no
This is probably one of the most packed games of all time filled to the brim with dlc and then when it eventually gets boring after thousands of hours you can try amazing mods that unlock tons of more content such as gta rp through fivem and story mods that change the story completely and the way the graphics look

Online makes me livid.
"If you love shooting people for no reason and running over people for no reason, this is the game for you."
"For a AAA game studio, this game is dog shit. Stressful, irritating, and impossible to do anything of value by yourself."
online is good ig
Rlly makes u feel like a guy who can't afford a car of his own
master piece
gggg
veri gud game buy it
i love this game its so fun to play with friends
Game is cool
Very nice game but has a lot of crashes
"Howdy reader, let me state that this review is only for the single player / story mode experience.  To be to the point, this game is good not fantastic, it could have been fantastic if some elements were different, even so - I think you should play it if you haven't already, it's a fun ride.  The main reason why this game is not amazing is because it lacks depth, depth in story, in characters and the world surrounding it; the idea of having three protagonists is quite revolutionary for a triple A game, taking that into consideration, we needed more for every main character, especially for Franklin. Why not use secondary missions to expand on these characters? Their mindsets, their history, their relationships with other individuals, I wanted to understand them better, I perceived the mcs, I just wanted to get more out of these three. I wanted to get a clearer picture of Franklin's hood life, his bond with Lamar, with his ex, with his childhood friends, there was enough structure for that to happen, instead what we got was futile missions who are mostly running jokes or their existence is there only to get a mechanic from the game, which is fine - we can have those but we need the build up missions also, they are essential for a story based game such as this one. I hoped to view additional content of Michael's family life, to spend time with Jimmy, Tracey, Amanda, they're nice kids and I disliked the fact that we went with the full on stereotype characters. Same for Trevor, I craved to watch into his head so to speak - to make proper sense out of him. My point is, this game is too short and it's short for the reason that we have too many meaningless missions that do not shape your protagonists, those quests are forgettable.  You feel like a ragdoll at times due to the fact that the physics are quite strange, the controls for helicopters, airplanes, parachutes and so on are kind of bad on the keyboard, you get used to it though it can be irritating once in a while. GTA's V universe it's detailed, same for the map yet much of the side content it's rather shallow, sure you can do yoga, play tennis, golf and whatever, only most of the players with ignore those activities for half of the game if not for the entire game, keep those inside the game but you also need features to have actual entertainment to follow because it feels natural to follow since you enjoy it. Radio stations required diversity in the music genres, once more, it's good, it could have been superior - perhaps is my taste? I don't know, however, across the majority of the stations, on every channel, I liked what? Usually two songs? I'm only saying they were deficient in quality music, in my opinion and you need quality music since half of the activities will be inside a vehicle. You can say more, though, who wants to read this much?  8 / 10."
"A lot of good things in this game. The hours are basically all from singleplayer mods and such, i have almost 900 hours on ps4, and man the online has only gotten worse. I played a little bit of vanilla online on PC, and it's also pretty bad. If you really wanna give this game a try, find some friends to play with ESPECIALLY early on and stick with them, playing this game solo is a miserable experience."
"Yes, It cured my Sheldon copper disorder"
tyi
STILL THE BEST GAME TO EXIST
I hate the hookers in this game need more animation
I picked C. Aint that a bitch
honestly its fun
One of the best games if you like a good story!
"The game is fun until you want to do business cargo runs/selling items and then a dude with the sole purpose of griefing you will hunt you down and ruin your fun. Every server has one or 2 of these people as well as the many hackers/ modders in the game who also, are in at least 1 or 2 people per server. Get rid of the mk2 = make the game good again."
I like the cheats
Great game for adults!
Play this game but look out for modders
"hackers make or ruin ur game,but I got sum contacts"
can make my day feel awesome..
My mom said not to play it so I did it is good game I say
"its fun, online is quite a grindfest but if u dont devote all your time to one thing in the game its quite fun"
ederg
Reasons i like this game  1. I can shoot up a Gas Station  2. I can do a JFK  3. Drive bys are fun  4. i can do whatever the shit i want  5. The missions  ANd lastly i can push people off buildings lmao
TOO GOOD

No Tutorial on the many stupid mechanics on online as well as an unbearable amount of cheaters

game is really good just has some fps drops
pew pew pew
Still playing this while waiting for VI to come in the near future
i don't like the game
"If you want this game to play online, wait for GTA 6. Everytime you join a lobby you either get obliterated by every hack known to man, or you get given EVERYTHING ruining proggression and your entire experience. Rockstar does not care about pc players and wont be any help. In this games defense though, the actual game is enjoyable, its just unplayable."
"Can't play GTA 5 due to the one of the worse anti-aliasing in any game I've ever seen. Max graphics, max anti-aliasing, 2k res, flickering everywhere. Annoys my eyes,  5hrs game time, 50hrs trying to fix an issue that can't be fixed.  Gross stuff."
good game must have so fun
goodn tgaje3 bro
Nais Gaim🥶🥵🥵🥶🥶
jai mata di
muchooooo niceeee
".Best Rockstar Games game, my favorite game, apart from the bugs, I used to play this game on my ps4 as a kid, and now that it happened to my PC I can't play it, it has a perfect story mode, perfect characters, it also has online mode, with a wide variety of activities, such as races, robberies, etc. It is a game that will be recorded in the world of video games, simply a jewel..."

"Good game even after 10 years, recommended. Waiting for its next generation >_<"
best game ever played in my life

ttyigfpuioh9ip78uhgo
its a great game because when you complete the story mode you can play online or replay missions
the online receded faster than simeon's hairline
"I used to like this game, online isn't even worth playing anymore R* make games then fail to support them. If you like being frustrated by hackers in godmode this the game for you. Thanks for nothing R*   Save your time, and energy for something else - unplayable in 2023 unless you want story mode, GTA online is a joke probably even to R*"
I DONT LIKE THIS GAME...... I LOVE IT!!!
THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED !!!!!!!!!
jeeta
ffffffffffffffffffaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

Amazing fr
Nice game everybody knows that
this game is truly a game
vERY NICE
"NICE GAME, I GUEES?"
i recomend
The game is fun but ir's very grindy if you want to get money.  If you have alot of free time and don't get bored fast then i recommend this game.
"In my opinion one of the best open world games i've ever played. Tons of content. Instead of following an obligated set path of missions like most other games, you have 100% choice on which path you take right from the beginning. I got hooked from day 1 and have yet to be bored. That's my review for online since I haven't gotten far in story mode."
The game is lit

"I drove a plane into a military base, very cool"
Its hella good
broken online since 2013
"Liked this game a lot when I first bought it few years back. As it is now though, with modern hardware and windows 11, the game is pretty much unplayable with frequent stutters and crashes, never got optimized down the road at all. Pretty mad about it too, since I really wanted to replay the single player again before diving into multiplayer, but no such luck .. at crash number 68, within 24 hours of starting a new game :/"
buys game heads to strip club closes game with regret
game rất hay
Extremely fun game
Its all around approachable and fun.
ytt
quite good
Fire. Burn. Everywhere.
haha gun haha i kill you now haha get rekt haha
i love this mgame
Open world game very fun for me and realistic
tehehe
motorcycle fun
"So full of modders, it's unplayable. Can't do anything when I'm getting launched into the stratosphere and dumped in the ocean. Spend your money elsewhere."
"It was fun at first But it's the opposite of the gift that keeps on giving. It just gets worse and worse. The game is full of cheaters, is basically unplayable online. Every update the devs remove something else, making the game dull and boring.  I you are stuck with this game, try playing alone, and explore a bit. The game has some nice visuals."
The
If you delay GTA6 one more time...
I got ban😮‍💨
fun and a lot of things to do
should be aged for 1-100 very child like game
its gta 5 what more must I say
car go fly
online servers are kinda messed with hackers but you can negate this in settings by running an invite only lobby.
has a very big inflasin rate in gta5on
It's a fun game though can be challenging to start up due to how long it's been out with so much to do.  You'll have to start out in the single player version of online to make money doing open world deliveries and such as the public lobbies can be fun but chaotic and people will prevent you from making money.
Bad guy simulator (Very fun)
monekyssssssssssssssssssssss
Pls play it! It's an awesome game
"Good game, but it's rough starting as a beginner in online mode. Quite overwhelming, if I didn't have a friend to guide me. I feel like there should be a bit more tutorials to help you get started. Other than that, I would highly recommend."
it cool bro
Amanda is a little shit
This shit sucks
"Rockstars are basically cons artists, they have no support whatsoever, they charge you each time you buy their games, put you in their Social Club where those morons have no clue to keep an account secured...."
best game that has ever been released
I  like it
"I'm likely less typical type of player, as I enjoy exploration more than violence, but here GTA 5 shines too, as I loved moving through different city districts and nature zones, exploring the buildings, ads, infrastructure, wildlife, and random conversations.   And for me GTA 5 seems as a great compression of Southern California with its top features represented (from city to rural life and to expansive nature).   Loved GTA Online too as got some free money together with my purchase, which allowed me to customize my game ""lifestyle"" with looks, properties, and vehicles which I used with friend to showcase our customizations to each other.   Vert fun!"
good game but cussing and not allowed for 11 and under
It was decent.
"It took a long time before this game was in a state that I could enjoy in a long term, It's progressively gotten much more playable for solo players and for a game that advertises itself as the ultimate crime simulator this game is oddly relaxing to play and just grind when you need some peace and quiet. Its a classic game that I would highly recommend."
I loveeeeeee game
sound game
"I don't think what there is to like about this game needs to be explained, play this game and beat its story or you're an infidel and not a real gamer"
its a game about grand theft and grand auto
cats
good like money
made me a man again
i get to say bad words
fun w friends
"Good, sus game."

"Don't really recommend, its a pretty fun game but online is filled with hackers and can't really have much fun on public sessions.   that being said its a really fun game and its a good way to stay in shape. (I haven't finished story mode but I heard its pretty good)"
yo i cant
Certified hood classic
fix your game by getting rid of asshole hackers that roam your servers
"the best game ever, no questions asked"
"Very bad game update its like rockstar does not even care about gta5 too many bugs, Loading screens for ever and even new bugs like mechanic when i tryna spawn a vehicle it suddenly freezes the spawn and never coming i like this game overall but not whern its created by idiots"
Make an option so you can have sex with dog or shark
"I liked playing the story mode, but the online version isn't really worth it"
not work... social club key already use issue
"u know? The legends say every time there's a hacker in public session fucking with the game data & causing a lot of bug, there's a  dog with diarrhea  taking a shit on the graves of R* tech team ancestors  guess those dogs are doing it all the time"
"Great game, but I didn't like it as previous one. Characters are just not as good as Nico, Tony or Carl. Writing is more depressing and I didn't enjoy it as much. Technology is great tho. I love driving and shooting  I can't believe this game is almost 10 years old..."
I was raiding a hill billy place and he had his dick out
Do crime Kill fools make monay Nuff said

good game its fun
"Illuminati Confirmed.. but a great game (Story-Mode)!! Online is just pure time waste and grinding.. even tho I had a lot of fun with it for a very long time (Started playing on XBOX 360 in 2015 and went on to XBOX ONE later, then to PC till 2022). Really.. it's not worth buying that game nowadays."
Game won't launch
great game runs even on potato pc and overall great storyline and good gameplay
The BEST game but i think it's stupid why we cant play with other console players
"I would completely recommend this game to anyone seeking an immersive, in-depth gaming experience; that goes for, both, GTA V and GTA Online. Most definitely my favourite video game yet. (Yes, I'm British if you somehow couldn't tell)"
"really good game. online mode is only nice, if you can play with friends. public lobbys are so full of hackers, it's not even funny anymore :')"
great story nice graphics overall its just a well developed game
Got hit by a oncoming train because I wasn't observing traffic. 10/10.
i recommend this game to other players but its 1500 rs so  make it cheaper or free
"[H1]You forget a thousands thing everyday, pal. Make sure this is one of 'em.[H1]"
"The gameplay is enjoyable, But the servers are so utterly inundated with modders, mod clients and exploits that it makes playing online utterly worthless, and R* does not seem to be bothered with them.   Don't bother getting it for GTA:O.   1/10"

Its just a classic game
its good but hard to get to story mode
I bought thsi gae and it cracked

"This is the best game ever made,rockstar really did a good job on making the world and the story."
Beautiful graphics and amazing game-play. Online is the best! Especially if you have other friends!  Plus heli go brrrrrr
mONEY
GTA ONLINE IS BULLSHIT AND NOT WORTH THE TIME IT TAKES TO LOOK AT THE STEAM PAGE Also the single player is good except that I just played for like 6 or 7 hours and I couldn't easily find the save option so all of that progress is GONE
John Pork is calling.
christ i hate this fucking game
sweet
story mode was insane i would recomend and you can use mods so i would recomend downloading
wanna get bullied by tryhards? Play this game.
buh buh lmao
im retarded so i crash car
"""But I did kidnap his wife!""  From robbing millions of dollars and shooting your way through waves of police to simply enjoying a game of tennis, this game's single-player has been one of the most enjoyable experiences I had. There always feels like there is life to this game and it allows for immersive game play, especially when going on massive crime sprees."
amazing game cant wait to run it on a 4070!!!
Best Game i ever Played childhood Game
gta online sucks because rockstar doesnt do anyting about the people that mod their account and not ban them
this game is very good grapics
such a good game a little toxic but it is very fun(:
"I've never seen such a buggy game with such terrible servers and so many hackers. The fact that it has been out for 10 years and is still this rough is pretty inexcusable. Not to mention the engineered addictive nature and microtransactions.   I'm addicted, but you can still save yourself."
it fun nothing more
Nah
Greatest game of all time
"Good game. Pros: -Pretty good graphics. (Depends on what your settings are) -A good amount of guns. -Multiplayer. -Cool missions. -Pretty long game. -A ton of vehicles. -Fast ways to get money, but you need a lot of money to get money. (Bunkers, Facilities, Arcades, etc) -People can make their own races and stuff like that. -Races. -Heists. -A lot of things to do. Cons: -People fucking ruin multiplayer, ex: Hackers, Toxic ass mfs, Griefers, and trolls. (Luckily, you can go in ones by yourself or with only friends) -Flying vehicles in public sessions. -Things cost a fucking ton. -The blood looks kinda bad. Singleplayer: 8/10 Multiplayer: 6/10 Overall: 7/10"

"This game has been out since 2013 and still has more bugs than TF2, a game from 2007 whose developers have mostly abandoned at this point. I'm only posting this because I had to close GTA Online for the third time tonight thanks to an indefinite blackscreen and Steam asked if I'd recommend this to others. The answer is obviously no."
favorite game of all time
GOOD FUN
SUPER DUPER MOOPER FUNNNN :)
Yeah gta cool and all with online and everything but its only worth about 15 bucks so dont buy it other wise still love it

GOOD STORY MODE ALMOST MADE ME CRIED
Don't play the online version unless you want it to consume all your free time and extra cash.
great game to play with lemonkeyboy
"This is simply a beaut of a game. indubitably magnificent. this is the most well crafted story and multiplayer based game I have ever experienced in my life. Many may say that it has lost it's touch over the years, However, I simply must disagree. A game of this caliber simply cannot lose it's former greatness over time. I appreciate you reading this. Have a beautiful rest of life."
"Title: A Magnificent Urban Playground - Grand Theft Auto V Review  Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) stands as a monumental achievement in the realm of open-world gaming, offering an incredibly detailed and sprawling virtual representation of a vibrant and chaotic metropolis. Rockstar Games' masterpiece, released in 2013, continues to captivate players with its intricate storytelling, diverse characters, and an expansive sandbox environment that pushes the boundaries of what an open-world game can achieve.  From the moment you step into the sun-soaked streets of Los Santos, it becomes apparent that GTA V is an exercise in world-building perfection. The city is alive with an abundance of activities and attractions that cater to a wide range of play styles. Whether you're an adrenaline junkie looking to engage in high-speed police chases, a strategic planner orchestrating elaborate heists, or simply an explorer soaking in the urban sprawl, GTA V offers something for everyone.  The game's narrative is a tour de force, interweaving the stories of three protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor – whose lives and ambitions intersect in unexpected ways. The character development is exceptional, and Rockstar's storytelling prowess is on full display as they delve into the complexities of their personalities, backgrounds, and motivations. Each character is fully realized, making it easy to invest emotionally in their individual journeys.  System Specifications:  RTX 3060 60 Watt of Power 6 GB VRAM  Ryzen 7 5800HX 16 GB DDR4 RAM 512 GB SSD"
good game good for keeping u away from bordem lol

A fantastic game created by a greedy company.
the controls are pretty bad most of the time
gta innnit

child slavery  also dont go out w out yo homies bc a group of endermans chased my ass down the dark alleyway dawg aint playing it again
PLAY IYT AND BUYY IT FOR FGGAYDRIAN
its fun but the modes be overusing they powers n shi ngl
"Back when I got this game, it was fun. Adventures with friends, heists, and missions that you could do alone when friends were offline. Now, it's a buggy mess. Missions can't be completed, it keeps failing to connect to servers, hackers galore, you name it. There's a new game breaking bug every time I play now, and I find myself restarting the game 5 times a night.   Stop milking this game and don't put any more money into Rockstar until they provide something that's actually worth a damn. It's 10 years old Rockstar, move on. GTA Online is a terrible excuse for a gaming product and you can't even keep control of it anyway."
"If real life had cheat codes, I'd totally enter ""GTA V"" mode every morning! Who needs a snooze button when you can hijack a helicopter to work, right? This game turns Los Santos into a playground for chaos enthusiasts and traffic law critics. Just remember, in GTA V, jaywalking isn't a crime – it's a way of life. Watching NPCs drive is like witnessing a symphony of car crashes.  Pros: 🌆 Open world? More like open pandemonium! 💰 Robbing virtual banks: 10/10, would felonize again. 🚁 Traffic jams are for quitters; skydiving onto moving cars is where it's at. 🤖 NPCs with the driving skills of a brick on roller skates – unintentional comedy gold. 📺 Invaded by the ""Cops"" TV show? Just pay your virtual therapist with virtual money.  Cons: 🚔 Cops magically teleporting to your location: surprise party or police state? 💥 Accidentally punching the air while trying to enter a car – my character's new interpretive dance move. 🎤 Radio DJs: yes, I'm still here, and yes, I can still hear you.  Verdict: If life gives you lemons, make a ramp and jump a stolen car into the sunset. ""GTA V"" is a masterpiece of mayhem, where obeying traffic laws is merely a suggestion. So, put on your helmet, grab a rocket launcher, and let the anarchy begin!"
worst
"Love the sandbox game play and being able to drive multiple machines, commit crimes, and have fun all from the comfort of home"
yay cool gun go boom
Rockstar automaticly logged me out of my social club account and now i cannot play the game anymore. My steam account is supposedly linked with an email i have no clue about. WHY
"I have to say..... its fun pvp till he pulls the common free mod menu. BUT, when you get called a hacker. its worth all the money. 10/10 would play for another 500h"
its a good game overall
The ability to run all of your businesses in a private lobby is not something that should be ignored. It's great. I don't have to deal with any sort of griefers just my asshole friends.

very good pew pew
punching civilians is my favorite pass-time activity
Rockstar knows how to make you play a game
its the best game in the world
"For me, Grand Theft Auto V’s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane, fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time, whilst driving around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path, and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. “Typical!” one of them yelled at me, as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.  I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments, big and small, that make San Andreas – the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas – feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well-realised world and tells a story that’s gripping, thrilling, and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series, and there’s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn’t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It’s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto-aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road, though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last, Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons, mission checkpointing, ensuring that you never have to do a long, tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again."

"im mentally deranged, i should not be allowed to play this"
"great game, sucked me dry. EVERY LAST DROP"
Blegh.

this game sucks
If you can get through the ass pain of having to go through rockstars bullshit then youll already know this game is GOATed whether you play it on PC or Console youll have a great time. However for PC players - dont forget your shit cause rockstar will go through more girlfriends than you before they help you out in recovering your account.

"3k hours grinding online and 3k hours role playing. I don't regret it.  Waiting for GTA 6 and hoping it will expand on how much we can do to customize and personalize our cars (tunes, car accessories, lift kits, drift kits/tuning, specific engine upgrades). Also hoping fueling cars and turning signals would be a thing in GTA 6 too.  Also I really loved the setup camp feature from RDR2 and hope something like this would be implemented to GTA 6, be it chairs tents a rug maybe.  The most fun we had in this game is spending time with your friends in a private lobby, Hosting off-road events with our SUV's and Pickup trucks, camping and telling stories near the river around a campfire. Golden memories."

"I have been a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series for years, and Grand Theft Auto V absolutely exceeded my expectations! This game offers an unparalleled open-world experience that keeps you hooked from the very beginning.  The first thing that struck me was the incredibly detailed and immersive world of Los Santos. The city is bustling with life, from the diverse pedestrians going about their business to the stunning landscapes that seamlessly blend urban and natural environments. Every street corner has its own story to tell, making exploration an absolute joy.  The characters in GTA 5 are some of the most memorable and well-developed in gaming history. Michael, Franklin, and Trevor each bring their own unique personalities and backgrounds to the table, creating a perfect dynamic within the storyline. The voice acting and character animations are top-notch, making every interaction feel genuine and engaging.  What truly sets GTA 5 apart is its storytelling. The intertwining narratives of the three protagonists keep you invested in every twist and turn of the plot. The missions are diverse and exciting, ranging from high-octane heists to heartwarming moments that reveal the characters' deeper sides. The writing is sharp, witty, and often satirical, offering both thought-provoking social commentary and laugh-out-loud humor.  The attention to detail in Grand Theft Auto V is astounding. From the realistic physics and driving mechanics to the bustling traffic and pedestrians, the world feels alive in every way. Whether you're engaging in a high-speed chase, participating in a street race, or simply soaking in the beautiful sunset over the ocean, the level of immersion is unparalleled.  And let's not forget about GTA Online! The multiplayer aspect of the game adds a whole new layer of fun and competition. Whether you're teaming up with friends for heists or engaging in wild and creative game modes, there's always something new to explore and experience.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece that has set a new standard for open-world gaming. Rockstar Games has once again delivered an unforgettable experience that combines gripping storytelling, stunning visuals, and boundless opportunities for exploration. If you're looking for a game that will keep you entertained for hours on end, GTA 5 is an absolute must-play!"
The game has recently been very slow and glitchy. mechanic doesnt allow me to select the cars i want delivered. i cant enter my maze bank office/garage or custom shop always stuck on black screen forever when doing so.

"[h1]First Look[/h1]  [hr] [/hr]  As for me, lets say [I]im not incredibly fond of quite like any shooter game(such as Fortnite, CS GO etc.)[/I] because of them having pretty much only two main goals: Shoot any opponent on sight, and survive yourself which with time become just oblivious. But you would say: if so, then [b][I]Why am I recommending the game then?[/I][/b] Its quite simple, [b]  [I]Because GTA5 is NOTHING like those shooter games![/I][/b] This fact is due to GTA being an [I]Open - World Game[/I], which means that you not necessarily have to run around and shoot anyone aimlessly, but you can also progress in the storyline of the game itself (in Story Mode) or collaborate with  other player in quite any mission (in Online), for example: buy and re-sell cars etc.  [h1][...]TO BE CONTINUED[/h1]"

"Joined an online session, was immediately killed by a hacker. joined new session and started cargo run and another hacker teleport-ed to me killing me and my cargo straight away lol dont waste your money"
its fun and actually runs really well on my shitty acer laptop!!!! :P
the most time i've spent playing this game is rampaging against the cops  10/10 would terrorism again
buy a tank change your life
this game FUCKING SUCKS
its goaded
"This game is very inconsistent with it's over all performance. I don't know if this happens to anyone else, but this game has been stuttering so bad for a few years now to the point where its completely unplayable. I've tried all the ways to fix this stuttering issue like trying to lower my graphics settings, uninstalling and reinstalling the game, deleting all the files, restarting my computer, and using external apps to lower the Graphics settings and even more and none of that worked. I wouldn't recommend buying the game because you may face the issues i'm currently having."
i like loading simulator
helps me cope with life> i used to do the stuff irl but i found out insdead u can do it in gta without risk of getting shot  which is awesome! love this game.
I played GTA 5 on xbox one but I bought for a mod and It is still a great game even a decade later

hacker attack me ver mad rockstasr plese fix as i can not play
"This is probably the worst GTA I ever played. The Story Mode is plainly boring. Many missions have bad design - go to another side of the city, like I have nothing better to do. Rewards for side-missions are not exciting. Trevor's character is seemingly stolen from Kane and Lynch. GTA Online was bugged for me, the game doesn't consider a tutorial finished, and thus I don't have any job or activity."
10 y/o game btw
a game does not get any better
when the cheating gets SO BAD they shut down your game with their mods.... GTA online is a fucking joke I only play out of SHEER BOREDOM
my mummy said this game was evil i saw big bobs on this game
"Will Change if Ever Fixed.  Well, I got this game a while ago. I loved playing it for about a year. I got into the Online game world. Went to serve in the military. Come home, my accounts been stolen. Never was able to get it back. Very frustrated. Want to play with friends even today. Can't fix the account, can't change the account key, can't buy a second copy, lost all my progress and my stuff with my friends.  Tried to fix it in vain more than once, over months of waiting and checking.  Due to their data breach, had to go over all my other accounts, found my personal data out on the net, still haven't gotten my account back.  10/10 Great Game, horrible Life Decision in hindsight. Stopped buying Rockstar games as result. But would play again if I could ever figure out how besides rebuying the damn game."
"A well crafted master piece.  While plagued by micro transactions lately, they are easy to ignore. please do not pull a blizzard and shove microtransactions down everyone's throat."
"I fucking love this game, it is the best game ever, period!, Ladies and gentlemen. GTAV!"
I played
"Herf Derf yerrrr, yo gaba gaba"
This game is pretty fun i enjoy it
great game to have fun and play online with your friends took me only 16 hours to complete the story (i dont regret it)
"game used to be amazing when playing online, hackers make it non-enjoyable however, and even dangerous for your computer"
"Dont buy this game! Rockstar (the game devs) do not care about your account's security. If your social club account gets hacked like mine did then you can't play the game at all. it doesnt allow you to sign into another social club account and play even though you bought the game on steam with your steam account. Therefore you're just stuck with a copy of gta that you cant play because you no longer have access to the social club account you used it with. And to put the cherry on top, the social club account you use to play is linked to your steam account, so do what you want with that information but i wouldn't recommend wasting your money on a nearly ten year old game that'll allow just whoever to come and take all your personal information."
Game is unplayable due to online hackers that put you into small cages limiting your movement and forcing you to logoff and back in to only have it happen again in an endless loop. To add insult to injury steam refused my refund because I played 3 hours instead of the 2 hour cutoff even though I literally just  bought the stupid broke game few hours ago!
its gta what can u say

Enjoyable if you're playing with your friends
game is fun not for kids under 10 tho
"After thousands of hours on ps3 & ps4 and multiple purchases of this game over the years for various reasons, once again in 2023 I didnt think twice about purchasing gta5 for the 6th and final time on pc. So yeah I highly recommend Grand Theft Auto 5."
lamar is black jesus
good good ya
this game is fun tho play with your friends
very bad service from steam if you want to download gta 5 please dont waste your money here go somewhere else
YOOOO THE BEST GAME EVERRRRRR
"Basic open-world game with SO MUCH to do!  Missions, collections, hundreds of vehicles to drive, dozens of weapons, varied terrain, huge open world to explore... This game is just so much.  I especially love the crazy talk radio, and the soundtrack takes me back in time.    The only real complaint I have about this game is that all the characters are unlikable.  I really dislike all 3 playable characters because they're all bad people.  To an extent that's unavoidable in a game centered around theft and assassinations.  Still, it would be nice to have just 1 character who's not awful."
its the best game i have ever played i just has that vibe
"0 Stars. GTA used to be a really good franchise but R* has proven their incompetence by an absolute lack of attention to fixing bugs or preventing hacks. Most recently none of the in game menus work, so you're unable to complete missions, call for vehicles, or utilize anything that isn't on the in game phone. Loading still takes obscenely forever, even for a 10 year old game. That is when it actually does load between whatever areas it has to load. Too often you end up staring at a garage door trying to walk into a garage area or playing cloud simulator waiting for a load back into the world from a race or mission.  Instead of fixing issues like this which have plagued the game from DAY #1, R* has instead focused on bringing new characters, missions, vehicles, and weapons into the game. It doesn't matter how much content the game has if it's not playable! Even when the game is running properly, online griefers run rampant with glitchers, hackers, and exploiters to prevent even simple enjoyable gameplay. It always deteriorates into a PvP match instead of an open-ended world where people can play together. R* has never bothered to institute server options to prevent PvP outside of a ghost mode which makes it impossible for you to wield weapons thereby impossible to complete missions. Yes, nobody can kill you in this mode, but you can't play the game either. R* has ruined what used to be an amazing immersive series with an endless quest for profit."
Best storyline
A game set in an alternate reality where children dont exist.

"GTA Online is very inspiring.  You will meet some of the most braindead, sh!tstink, God awful people in this game.  If you ever feel like you aren't a good person or are just not happy with yourself, it's always a good idea go hop onto gta online and see how far from rock bottom you are."
"Good gameplay and story, works well even on a low end system."
Almost 2K hours just to get banned after a modder gave me action figures and crashed my game. Fuck you Rockstar fix your shit.

هذه اللعبة ممتعة ، ولكن ليس لمن يؤمنون بالله ، فهذه اللعبة لا تحتوي على معايير الكتاب المقدس ، لأنها تحتوي على عنف وجشع ومحتوى جنسي ، ولكنها قد تكون مسلية إذا اخترت ما تريد أن تراه شيئًا أن يكون مناسبًا ، ولكن في رأيي ، لا يتم تقييم كل شيء تقريبًا في هذه اللعبة على أنه وقت مرور جيد لمن يؤمن بالمسيح ، الابن الوحيد للأب.
this game is grate
kill people and take your anger out on peds

"Online: This game is unbelievably glitchy now. Having to restart the game many times or leave sessions for glitches. I just had a mission where I couldn't drive my own car :( ok though take an NPC's Car oh get to the missions car kill everyone around it and then I can't drive that car, Great wasted 10+ mins for literally nothing we can do to fix mission."
Legal👍

This game isso fun and i really reccomend it
Rockstar has turned into an antagonistic corporation. Just like every other big video game developer.
Please cancel [b] GTA 6 [/b]. I speak for everyone when I say we want to continue playing GTA Online. The only thing GTA 5 needs to be a perfect game is a paid battle pass. Thanks for reading!

best game known to man kind
Got banned cause game is dumb(jk its very fun)
ive hd to reintall this about 7 times and still dosnt work
Best open-world game ever
gooodddd
Very good game if you play with mods
"its a fun game with a 10/10 story. When you play online you will join in a public lobby with prob a griefer or 2 but i would to make money go in a private session (invite only). when you get further in online it gets more fun because you are able to buy more fun things to mess around with and give payback to the ppl who griefed you when you were tryna figure out how to make your first bit of money.  Overall Story: really good but gets repetitive (in my opinion) but fun when you play with mods (mods dont work in online Online: early game in public sucks, grindy, mid-late game it is fun."
"You get out of your 9 to 5, tired from work, drive back home. check your phone for messages or emails and you feel like getting on your PC but instead you just head to bed. Finally, you log off GTA Online...."
Nice OG game. Worth buying!!!
great game love the shoe store if you know what i mean i have 325 hours and i love it

"Full of hackers who won't let you play the game. Rockstar seems least interested in doing anything about it. Even with good net and system requirements the game take forever to forever to load. Only few times it gets loaded, but evene with that it has tons of bugs ingame and obviously hackers to ruin your gameplay."
excellent game highly recommend 5/5 stars

Bw the beat game ever i played. Thanks Rockstar❤️🥹⭐
"You who never had to chanse play this, would recomend but  nah you all are just 12 years olds"
very good worth it for money
good ganme
"I don't know what to say, other than it's a fun game that doesn't follow many of the rules that other games are ensnared within. I don't know many people my age who play this game, but If your grandfather says that people his age don't play games like gta v, tell him that's why old folks get a reputation for being delicate. ... I haven't figured out most of the control details yet, but it hasn't stopped me from completing missions so far.  I tried to write something useful here, but I think I am going to keep playing and try this again later, when I have accumulated more experience."
i like this game it made me smarter :)

i cant fcking play gta online
runs fast on older machines
I love this game. And all of y'all should try it.
"This is a large-scale world open learning game developed by Rock Star Gaems(referred to as R Star), learning content is 1. Money management Step 2 Work part-time 3. Gun structure 4.

Work as a team Such as projects, online mode can improve social The background music and visual performance of the game are unique and there is a word that can beat R star only R star"
A Triple A title that aged very well
"I was mentally stable and had a decent amount of saving when I installed this game, Now I don't"
the best game i have played
uoyhgib
aw yep
The grind in Online is fucking horrendous and the monetisation is predatory at best. Fun with friends though so there's that.
"Online is super fun, good amount of content, it can be grindy but its really worth it in the end. Absolutely love the cars toooooo :3"
It's a fun game
it gta
Veri god
solid stuff in this here game
I loved the game still do. Played it when i was younger and in high school. would not recommend getting on digital unless it's from a third party that bypasses the rockstar launcher and epic. As it stands The company has made it more difficult to play the game online as well as to just play the standard campaign without a login gatekeep. get the ps4 or ps3 version and check out the community modding scene to get your moneys worth.
i swear i just bought this game about 3 weeks ago
"Great game till now, i highly recommend it"
5 stars
good pew pew
i love how the game makes me want to eliminate myself but then i see my charachters gigantic booty and it makes me cream so in conclusion
Good morning Amrica
Very fun and goood game recommend

Not my R*. Change the name. Everything except the single player has been tainted by 2k. Even their stance on modding.

"Firstly i wanna say that Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece. Story, gameplay, characters, details, nature... Everything just everything was incredible. Unforgettable experience that was.   BUT!  The online part was the pain in the ass. I mean everything was fine the missions was fun and challenging. But i don't understand how they can't prevent this cheats in the game, it's so annoying. But u know what the saddest part about it? Not the failed missions because of cheaters, not the despair feeling. The saddest part is that this ""humans"" who uses cheats are mentally ill and i think that they need to get help. Because it's really not a normal behavior.  I hope that Grand Theft Auto 6 would be prepared for this cheaters. Good luck Rockstar."
amazing game love having all my guns taken away by modders really fun rockstar
its gta fam
Got killed by a flying motorcycle. 10/10
"[h1]Single-player[/h1] The single-player is great. The missions are fun and hold up well after all these years.. I think the problem is the story: The protagonists are great, but the antagonists leave a lot to be desired. There isn't a villain like Dmitri Rascalov, Officer Tenpenny, Dutch or Micah. It's a more vague thing, like ""Michael's problems"". So you hop from minor antagonist to minor antagonist until the story ends because Michael's arc is finally completed. I'm not sure it works from a climatic point of view. The gameplay feels evolved from GTA IV, the animations are much smoother, the graphics are better, the world overall feels more sophisticated and more populated, there is simply just more content. This is not without its drawbacks, however: Some things have been scaled down, like the physics simulations in shooting and driving and the damage model to cars. I don't know if it was due to game performance or not, but since this game was made for the PS3, I guess they couldn't fit all the new things without taking some old things out first.  [h1]Online[/h1] The online is very fun... with friends. If you play in a public session, you can count on some griefing, some hacking giving you money so R* bans you, some funny guy crashing your game... but if you play private sessions with friends it's very enjoyable.  I like exploring all the content added to the game over the course of these 10 years. The first heists are a bit dated now, but the Casino Heist, Doomsday and Cayo Perico are great. It shows R* learned what works and what doesn't. But you don't need these things to have fun. I enjoy doing things like Top Gear-type challenges in places where you don't really go in the story, so you have a lot to explore before you feel like you need to buy expansion content.  [h1]Microtransactions[/h1] GTA Online has these microtransactions called shark cards. People complain the expansions are very grindy because they feel R* wants you to buy them. I agree. It feels like they made them with the following options in mind: - A: Buy a shark card so you purchase the property/car/etc and its upgrades -> the expansion is fun and yields good in-game money, so you can buy more things and have more fun. - B: Grind to purchase the thing, then grind some more so you can purchase the upgrades which make the property profitable: not as fun.  Same thing with cars and houses. In Midnight Club LA, R* sold car packs for $2.99, now they sell cars for a million GTA$. This gives you the option to pay with your time instead of only your wallet.  Nobody tells you about this, it's very subconscious. If R* went with option A and sold the expansions/DLC on the side, people wouldn't complain, but they probably wouldn't care either or call the game P2W, so I feel like it worked out okay."
dis gejm gud evrivan bay it
"I made Michael look like Andrew Tate when his wife left him so he could get on his sigma grindset and win her back. I wish you could have done the same thing with Franklin and his girl, but shes messing with some brain surgeon or lawyer or something. She was black anyways so I got him a schizophrenic white girl that eats dry wall and soil."

"This game is pretty bad honestly. If you're buying this game to play online , Just don't. I have almost 100 hours on this game and it takes literal hours to get a match for missions going . There's modding everywhere. It's really only worth the money for the story. Rockstar games is way past their prime and it clearly shows when you see their newest content."
its good but old asf

"Sometimes it just keep loading and doesn't work when I try to enter online, and right now I am still loading I can't join online, I hope you fix that Rockstar."
amazing grahics\game recommendations
a very silly little game
IF I GET STUCK IN THE LOADINGF SCREEN ONE MORE TIME ROCKSTARS GONNA GET THIS D
Cant be fucked to give a review but the strip
1040 hours. game is unplayable. they let modders run their game for them
definitely recommend it ❤
"I cannot play the game due to Steam being linked to my Rockstar Social Club account. Haven't played in a few months, tried to open the game and it updated. My email now will not work because of the link and I don't have a way to access the random email (I assume created by Steam) associated to reset the password. Absolutely wack to pay for a game and jump through a bunch of hoops just to not be able to play it. Complete uninstall/reinstall does not work either. DO NOT RECOMMEND UNTIL THIS IS FIXED."

"s tier type game, recommend online thats fun to."
"GTA V, a 10-year-old game, still manages to blow my mind with its incredible visuals.  The city of Los Santos looks stunning, with vibrant colors and attention to detail that rivals modern games. Rockstar's dedication to updating and enhancing the game has kept it fresh. For a game that's been around for a decade, GTA V's graphics are still great.  If you haven't played it yet, you're missing out on a visually captivating experience that stands strong even today."
awesome foursome
Grand rp on top
OVER COOKED.
Its a really fun game to play and all the missions are really fun its very realistic.
Is it even needed to look into reviews for this game
"changed my life in 2015 playing it as an adult is cool too, there's a lot of interesting commentary that's still pretty relevant in 2023  there's weekly updates, and they've always released dlc for no extra cost after the game's initial success =)"
it can stop responding and not load sometimes but i love it to much
"if you can look past all the grinding, sometimes this game is very fun. a must play with friends"
best game for game lovers.
"Very fun yes,  only downside is gta 6 isn't released yet."
great game cant wait 4 vi
Story Mode playtime: 160 hrs Worth it.
cant load into the game with being stuck on rockstar logo. Rockstar games support was utterly useless in helping to fix this issue. waste money for me. i cant get a refund because while troubleshooting i logged in 14 hours somehow. 0 hours worth of playtime
FESDRGRFETDGESDRTGESDRGESDRGFESDRGRFESGESRFESRFESR
its not letting me sign in its dog shit
The Best game for my opinion
"I wanted to try it again after a few years the stupid link acounts and passwords are fucking dumb and stupid, i cant play the game i buy anymore, great job rockstar, your obsesion for having our info ruins the experience"
ubo
"This game is one of the worst games you can buy. It seems fun and at times can be, but the amount of bs anyone has to get through to get to the fun parts is insanely too much. If you are lucky enough to load in before 30 mins of failed attempts (not my network), you will then get to try calling the mechanic to bring you one of the cool cars you bought, and that vital menu freezes 50% of the time. So players must get to their garages to use their cars and go do missions and PLAY THE GAME, and 60% of the time you load into a building or garage, your game gets stuck in a loading loop. If you are lucky, you can press alt f4 or tab out a few times and then load in, or just restart your game and the porcess entirely. And if you somehow are driving around in your sick car doing a mission or just cruising, you have 30 seconds before a hacker or a mk2 oppressor kid explodes you and then continues to explode you until you leave the session or go passive mode, which then you cant use any of the parts of the game that are fun. Or it will be a hacker on an oppressor. I have had a lot of fun on this game, but it has caused so much frustration and wasted so much of my time just on loading screens. SAVE YOUR MONEY buy a simpler game or one not made by rockstar or get a better hobby than video games."
GREAT BEST GTA5 on
funny but crashes sometimes
still waiting for gta 5 :')
way to many cheaters
kenzo kenzo
Its fun :)
NOT ANY OTHER GAME CAN REPLACE GTA 5
good game very fun
love the strip club but u have to take off the undies too
bad game.
"I do not recommend this if you play for online mode I've been a gta player for over 12 years on console who now moved to pc and I'll say one thing for sure THIS GAME SUCKS the anti-cheat is terrible and the only reason people cheat on this game is to be a prick or to get money because rockstar refuses to make their game playable to a degree that is good for casual players this game has been and always will be terrible and a shit place to spend your time here's a few problems I have with it  1. Its impossible to be in a public lobby: there is almost no conceivable way to be in a public lobby without some jackass using or advertising their shitty mod menu a example is a guy named Ineludible who is always advertising their scam malware mod menu and crashing and or killing you every time you call him out for trying to scam people or steal their info  2. Rockstar wants you to buy shark cards: I have believed that rockstar has pushed their shitty version of a pay to win system forever they purposely make jobs underpay and heists too hard to grind because they need you to buy their micro transactions and I fully believe gta 6 will be exactly the same because go figure rockstar does not give a rats ass about keeping this game nice and playable they just want to milk it dry and I know that for a fact because as someone who played on console for ages I got excited over little things like a tire falling off your car if it got hit to hard but rockstar won't ever start caring because gta is just a cash grab to them  3. the players: the playerbase is some of the most toxic and hard to put up with people ever between the griefing, modding and just exploiting they're horrible and they almost always use some lame ass excuse ""you're meant to kill other players"" or ""it's in the game for a reason"" it doesn't excuse the players to be as shit as they are you get little to nothing from ruining someones hard work yet they still do because they are terrible people and rockstar refuses to ban these people because they're just more money holes to be used not to mention the fact that rockstar denies making lobbies where you can play most things solo because ""you need more people"" from the bottom of my heart I hate this game and I'm sure rockstar does too"
"Really good game, so many fucking cheaters online tho im having flashbacks to warzone"
hggfyiughbigytred5sdtcfg
amazing story mode is a 9.5/10 the only bad part is gta 6 is never gonna pass it
i would rather hit my nuts with an acid dipped spiked baseball bat than get griefed on here by level 7000s and modders. every game i load into a game the titanic is either floating around in the sky or im getting nonstop killed by an opressor nerd
This supports my gambling problem and my poor purchases on the internet
"everyone knows everything said about this game, story good, online bad, but holy shit is online sometimes impossible. sure grinding is inevitable but sometimes its genuinely hard to fathom how much you have to grind, not to mention its been the buggiest piece of hardened dried shit on the side of your ass crack. crashing,  hackers, servers getting fucked, uncomfortable controls at best and an overall shitty experience especially playing alone makes online dogshit. rockstar also really does not care about fixing the game because some fucking selfish shitheads just love to keep buying shit like shark cards, letting rockstar chill with their actual billions pouring in every year all the while theyre removing good content because they know theyll just get more money anyways. story fire though."
love this game!!!!
don't believe the 6.9 hours on record most of the time i've played this game offline its probably closer to like 70 and i only played it for like a week. insanely fun but genuinely an unhealthily addicting game
i like shooting people
shooting npcs fun
my wee wee go BOING BOING BOING!
fun but hackers everywhere
TAKES TOO MUCH DAMN TIME
Because the gta series are a great game in general
Good game especially considering its over 10 years old.
"Playing the campaign mode again on 2023 , still doesn't dissapoint"
Can the developers stop using this game for free money already and release GTA6?
yas play again soon adfihlbauhfainn
"Pros: Really fun game in story mode worth getting on sale, haven't played multiplayer and don't plan to. Cons: For the love of god make better airplane/helicopter controls ...  Edit: played a bit more and the controls for airplane/helicopter/swimming are so bad for pc that I have to downvote this game, have completed about 50% of the game and I just got another swim/helicopter mission, I'm done, bad game for pc uninstall."
love this game and the mods
"i love the game, i enjoy playing this with my friend and the story mode"
bounced on my boys d!ck to this for hours.
very good with friends
its gta comeon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
t76yjykguyhyjgyjhygyfthyjygfytht76g
it great to play
"gvhgvmghv,kj"
"Worthless game where players are allowed Vehicles that don't even follow ""Physics"".  Really now if people wanted to play Halo they should be playing Halo.  The ""Oppressor MK2"" should be renamed to the ""Noob Bike"" for what it is.  Rockstar games have no idea what the hell they are doing with their game."
C'mon why are you reading reviews? It's GTA.

Save yourself

there are black people so mid game #ihateniggers
buuuuuuuuuuuuus
"This is the only game in the GTA Series that I have ever known. But for the entire 185.4 hours I have on record, only like 10 of those are probably on story mode. My recommendation is this game is worth it just to play online. It is great, amazing, full of action and adventure, that this game can really be for anyone, well anyone at least 17 years and older, but we all know there are kids who will get it anyway. I will end with this. This game has taken a huge chunk of my life or at least a few days worth of it anyway, and I will say it were some of the calmest days I have ever had. Probably helps its a game I was watching my babysitter play when I was like 11 or so so I have been interested in the game for a long long time."

FUN SO MUCH CANT WAIT FOR GTA 6
NEEDS MORE ROBO SEX
bro i literally played this game for 23hr and i was loading for 22 and a half hour
Good game nice

"finally, my parents let me get this game"
i love getting blown up randomly by 8 year olds
Story mode: GOOD! Online mode: BAD!
grand theft auto is a very fun game. i love it and i think it will be a gem forever
I'm new this game and I enjoy it already :nekoheart:
This game is nice and all with good graphic but one problem is that its keeps on crashing and the online mode is so bad its so hard  to complete a mission/heist as the online people keep on leaving or dying so i 100% dont recommend this game
got banned for 6 months
This is a game were you don't have any boundaries or rules and you can do literally whatever you want.
hmmmmmmmm
so nostalgic to play this game love it
GTA6
Murdering the crips
Awesome gamne i definitlyeym will buy it again

Rockstar is the definition of a game studio that only cares about money and not about having a decent product anymore.
GREATE IN THIS FU.. WORLD

"Not capable of caring less about the single player story. Absolutely love the online content with friends though. Game can be a bit of a grind at times, but once you get yourself up and running, it gets pretty easy to keep money flowing without having to resort to shark card purchases. Definitely don't regret picking it up."
its the best i have so much playing
made bank then lost money

"One of the most iconic video game of all time. Amazing story line, once you're done with the story you can go check out online mode which is really fun but be ready to meet so hackers or toxic 11 year old British kids from Manchester."
Trevor is worth it.

I liked this product
I CAN'T FIND THE BUT OPTION
"if you ignore all the bugs and the hardship called ""getting money"" and only concrentrate on the cardriving engine and everything that has to do with vehicles, it is an amazing game"
"Bought this game strictly for GTA Online, because I had beat the story mode 2-3 times on XBOX One years ago. I played for a few hours, went on youtube, saw Cayo Perico Heist was best money... withing 2 days I had Kotsaka and did my first Cayo Perico Heist. Grinded CPH for 2 weeks, bought every buisness and vehicles i would ever want and quit. It got super super super boring..... 40-50 million for 100 hours of game play and to my liking, ive beaten GTA Online.... This is a pointless grind. Wait for GTA 6..... maybe?"

"Semplicemente un capolavoro senza tempo, dopo più di 10 anni dalla sua uscita GTA 5 riesce ancora a tenere testa e a parer mio a superare anche molti giochi attuali, con una storia semplicemente unica, il gameplay risulta sempre pulitissimo, anche se con dei minuscoli bug che comunque non vanno mai a inficiare significativamente nel gameplay, e poi anche dopo 10 anni questo gioco ha un reparto grafico formidabile, semplicemente un successo senza tempo"

Since I loose access to the email account linked to the stupid Rockstar launcher I cant use the game anymore... What a gimmic.... This email (Gmail) is deleted since I stop using any Google shit.... So result I paid for a 108GB game for nothing.    PS: Even if I try to create another Rockstar account I got the error message: Your steam account is link with another email .... so FUCK OFF
c un criss de bon jeu mais y faut le 6 la tabarnak
a hacker in online decided not to kill me and instead gave me some weapons

You cant run over children
[b] You can shoot to black people like in real life. But GTA has a bad side: you can't kill childrens. So 9/10.  [/b]

"Single Player/Campaign game is great, just want you'd expect from a GTA game. However GTA Online is terrible, full of glitches, stuck loading screens, and hackers/modders that like to grief players."
"this game really puts you on an impossible grind and will most likely crash many times for many of you. good game for messing around though, you are going to wish you had money"
I killed my sister with an orbital cannon.
epik pfun game
drive car shoot npc heist then log off
Love the game its really fun i played this for 17 hours and i recmond playing this but the thing i dont like is that online theres no strip club which i need to check the atm because i need to take cash out so add that back to online
"THERE ARE SOME HACKERS IN ONLINE, BUT YOU CAN PLAY IN A PRIVATE SERVER SO ITS GOOD. i just realised i typed that all in caps and im not gonna retype that."
I BELEIVE THAT THIS GAME IS FOR 13 OR OLDER BUT IM NINE AND I LOVE THIS GAME SO
is gta v kid findy
"GTA V - great game. I still think GTA SA and GTA Vice City are still better, because they have more iconic settings. GTA Online - Ignore/Stay away. GTA Online turned from fun idea to grindfest/money sink. I can't give it a possitive review because it exploits it's player base. STOP WASTING MONEY ON MICRO TRANSACTIONS, only buy full fledged expansions (GTA V realy needs atleast one)."
kau ma spün wau ma wü
my family left 10/10
"dear rockstar games, this game is too violent, i stuck my 2 and a half year old child in front of my screen for 5 seconds and he picked up a gun and shot my wife in the head. 10/10 game. hated that slut"
cna i see my wife yet
"great idea and game for a time till they gave up on it and allowed hackers to ruin what was fun about the online aspects. Instead of fixing it, they would rather just shove a bunch of new stuff in your face to try and make you forget. All new stuff, never fixing none of the old, bad stuff"
jjjhhmmhhh  bbvfggfgggf

"Imma be real I haven't touched the story at all and I don't intend to, I'm purely playing this for the Online aspect and while the age of this game certainly shows itself from time to time, I'm enjoying the Online experience with my friends. We've done heists and tons of missions together and I feel like i'm getting better and better at it the more I go through, plus the Nightclubs allow me to make some real money without making me feel like I have to open my own irl wallet just to fully enjoy the game. Haven't spent a dime and i'm having a blast."
"It's been 3 years without GTA 6, I can't stop shaking and I'm having severe mental breakdowns. I woke up today trying to buy GTA but the game is not here , I had a major panic attack but managed to calm down after a few hours. I couldn't go to work today, I am so worried that I even took my dad's gun from the shed and started to speed boost. I am nothing without GTA 6, it is my life, it is my destiny, without GTA 6, I wouldn't be able to do anything. GTA 6 is the best thing i ever seen and I can't get rid of my addiction to it, it is the best game in existence. I can't stop trembling and crying, I am very worried. I used all of my money on gta games , I don't know what to do. GTA 6 can't be gone any longer cause if it does then I'll go insane again.. breaking my mouse, chair, house, and everything I own. GTA 6 is very amazing and GTA 6 is my life."
pitulin
best overall open world game ever made
its good but theres no workshop bc i want to play as a cop or something but i have to a crap ton of downloeds.
"really fun, you can do about anything until cops get on your ass LOLL"
My Rockstar Games Social Club account got hacked so now it won't even let me launch the game :)
"Campaign is absolutely amazing. Well written lore, and an unbelievable story you can sink into. Online mode is insanely awesome. Yet another absolutely amazing story to dive DEEP into. Only concern is the sheer amount of hackers/cheaters and harassment from non-gamers/""try-hards""."
fun game with lot of stuff to do
Epic game just can you make a police job so we dont gotta install a mod like LSPDFR

Just Get It
IT'S A GOOD GAME
"The graphics? They're really good. Then again I expect nothing less from Rockstar. The game's world, Los Santos, feels so alive. You've got these stunning sunsets that light up the skyline, rain soaked streets that look real enough to touch, and just a level of detail that's amazing. Walking around the city or driving through the streets, you can't help but appreciate the small stuff like how the light hits surfaces or the expressions on people's faces. Especially online mode. GTA V's online mode is the icing on top. If you're into action packed gameplay, you're in for a treat. Both of these make the whole experience feel like you're right in the middle of this awesome virtual world. Whether you're teaming up with friends or just out exploring, GTA V nails it on both fronts and it's a game you won't want to miss."

"If you're going to play online, make sure you have your therapist ready on call because of how bullsh** this game is. Except single-player, single-player is a blessing."
"idk, just got it but so far it seems good. Well see what its like down the road!"

"this game is so fucking gay it gives you suicidle thoughts and might eventually brainwash u into doing very bad stuff like maybe killing urself or others and not necessary killing but harm aswell u will eventually get tired of the game and of life and will end up doign diabolical shit irl i highly do NOT reccomend to play this gay game. for ur own sake use the money u could use on this game at something alse. WARNING TO PARENTS please keep your kids away from this game, even tho if they begg you to buy them the game do NOT buy it i am speaking from experience and i do not want anyone alse to experience what i receantly did"
bro
good game because i like it
"had a lobby without a modder once, good game, sometimes the game doesnt give you way to slow cars with way to strong enemies that do way to much damage and respawn infinitly for missions, griefers most often have an iq of below zero flying into a building and then leaving after killing you, THE BEST PART YOU HAVE TO PAY REAL MONEY TO PLAY THE GAME. story mode good tho, you can beat woman good game will orbital cannon children again 10/10"
amazing game waiting for gta 6
aahe hhayw game
chili
This game allows players to obtain your IP address with third party software. Players can follow you to any lobby and grief you even in invite only lobbies. Players can kick you from the lobby or shutdown your game. Play at your own risk. Use a VPN if you have one.

The BEST game for missions and exploring would definitely recommend and the only thing it needs are a workshop that doesn't work in online also i cried when i finished the game because my body forced me to kill Michael
"Stick to invite only lobbies now, and just make some chill friends. That will improve the game experience. It gets grindy and public lobbies are setbacks."

A modder made me deaf. Pretty good game though.
"Great Game. Really Engaging. Fun Missions. Police chases are Intense. the Police have Mental Issues. It turns Really Tense when you Get low Health. Sad when you Complete story tho. Trevor is A Comedy Genius. Exactly like Me. It has Variety (Cars, Trucks, Map, Clothes, Characters, Modes). and can Be Forever playable if You use Mods. :D  Also. if they Have the Touching Feature in the Strip Club. they Better add a Full on Sex feature into GTA 6. Or online :)  Serious note. really Great. And its Getting Frequent Updates. online Is great too."
Very fun with friends
This game is a classic and a must get in my opinion
ALOWS FIVEM SERVERS REALLY OJIO TOILET COOL MUUUS

"GTA V is an all in one game, especially for simulation fans. I love the open world and physics of this master piece!"
Very fun anyone who wants to download this game obviously knows about it so just get it worth the price.
"Far past it's glory days, but still GTA V is a fun game that has a decent story, an almost unbeatably good open world experience, and plenty of activities to do."
very broken in ways but addictively fun with friends

"Rock* has horrible assistant help services (Socialclub). I was trying to log back into my account because it had gotten hacked, and Rock* was like sure thing we will get to it; then stopped replying and it has been over a week. Honestly, if you want this pos game go right ahead. Like they have made billions of dollars, and still can't assist the people who are actually playing the game.   Dear Rock*, suck my f*ck*ing fat nuts. Honestly, i would rather play ROBLOX than this pos game."
it is a very fun game and online is fun too!
Noice?
One of the best game ever invented
i killed my friend
its a very good game even as a console veteran of the game i can recomend it but a downside are the modders and Rockstar Games is doing a good job of banning them so i can recomend the game
tried playing fivem gta and i couldnt idk whyyyy
BJ is possible.... Or.. I´ve heard its possible...
very fun good for your kids
Better and improved :D :)

"One of the best games out there. The storyline ,gameplay, and physics are top tier."

I have been locked out because I can no longer access the email I used when I first bought the game. Seems silly I can't even play offline without a 10 year old apple account.
GOOD STORY and creative

"Really like the story mode, the clean graphics and the music. The cars are nice but it does feel weird having no fast food or restaurants to visit or dine in like GTA SA. Definitely would recommend to everyone."

"I still haven't beaten this game, online is just too fun when you're allowed to do what you need to."
Modders/hackers make the multiplayer unplayable and the lackluster story does not make up for this.
very fun with frends

"Amazing story mode, grindy online mode. Also, do not buy shark cards as it's piss easy to make money in GTA Online nowadays..."
i ran over 20 ppl
garbage!!! hackers never ending HACKERS!!!! and Rockstar refuses to care or even show any remorse or course of actions taken to fix there game but hey shark cards are on sale!! dont buy this garbage you can buy an account from third party services for LITERALLY 3% of the final cost through steam or rockstar. GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE!
"super, time saver"
megaballs
best game ive played since a long time. keeps you busy
"the server getting so slow lately even i have a decent internet and a good pc setup,but when everytime i try to enter gta online its took me forever"
my friends keep going to the strip club and its pissing me off
30 hours in and I'm still not-  FUCKING FUCK YOU GET OUT OF MY ROOM OR ILL SHOOT!... im still not that violent...
when i get 200 hours ill deinstall
Eh its pretty good.
Good game rockstar
enjoy
suud
Lots of hackers
A lot of hackers in the game. The same few people pop up at random times in your games to leave spam discord messages then leave afterwards. There is pretty much no limit to what the hackers can do to destroy your gaming experience. The game is fun but it's hard to enjoy it when the game's economy is based on Bidenomics and hackers are constantly playing God.
"best game ever, even the server is suck"
goog graijus
try it love it
"This game is a buggy mess. I can't believe Steam and Rockstar are allowed to accept money for a game that is unplayable half the time. This game is so old there should be no problems at all. I own this game on PS4 and have never had so many loading problems as I have with this version. This game should be removed from the store until it is fixed and loads correctly on a consistent basis. Between the hackers and the stuck loading screens, refunds should be given to everyone who paid money for this crap."
its rlly fun i rlly like it
Its GTA and mostly play for online. pretend gamble and pretend gangster. sure
Fun as fuck with friends. Dogshit with randoms
Gun go br br Car go vroom vroom Lester -> (discord moderator)
"8 years later, online on PC is still full of mod menu / hax users, spam murdering everyone with exploits and they can join off you into the next session and keep it going.   Unless you specifically play invite only servers with your mates / discord buddies. You should buy it on console to avoid le hax."
Rockstar and it's servers stinks.
"Used to be good, now 6/10 times there's hackers every server and 8/10 times it just loads infinitely and servers are broken. They gave up on it like Red Dead."
great game 9/10 because sometimes when you are first starting out in online mode pros can greif you with their crazy vehicles but other then that defiantly buy it
Definitly not racist.
This game is sexy
I LOVE THIS GAME I LOVE THE CHEATERS I LOVE THE DDOS
YUHHHHH
I would say its okay because there are some spammers and they get really annoying.
And you dis man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Wish I could use the online stuff in singleplayer, can't figure out the modding so i'm at the point where i'd happily pay an extra £30 just to use the online content (weapons and vehicles) in SP - £60 if they converted all the quests, businesses and heists too. not to mention being able to ng+ as a GTAonline character in SP (i'd pay £20 for that alone)- yet another thing i'd legit pay for since i love the online content but hate playing online in the community."
"Still haven't got past the loading screen, Hope the game's good!"

"single player campaign is fun. good story, good length, well executed. online is a pain, and a massive drain of your time - vehicle balancing is bad, no real effective countermeasures, usually get griefed to hell. player base is toxic as hell.  ...will the above stop me playing? probably not"
A staple in gaming. Can't wait for GTA 6
"Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece that has captivated gamers around the world with its unparalleled blend of gripping storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and a dynamic open-world environment that offers endless possibilities. As a dedicated player and enthusiast, I can confidently say that GTA V stands as a shining testament to the incredible achievements of the gaming industry.  From the moment you step foot into the sprawling metropolis of Los Santos, you're immediately immersed in a living, breathing world that feels incredibly alive. The attention to detail is nothing short of astonishing, from the bustling streets teeming with pedestrians to the meticulously designed interiors of various buildings. Each nook and cranny of the city exudes authenticity and realism, making it a joy to explore and experience.  One of the standout features of GTA V is its engrossing storyline. Rockstar Games has outdone themselves by weaving together the lives of three distinct protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor - in a narrative that is both compelling and emotionally charged. The characters are multifaceted, each bringing their own unique perspectives and motivations to the table. Watching their stories unfold and intertwine is an experience that leaves a lasting impact, making you genuinely care about their fates.  Beyond the main storyline, GTA V offers an astounding array of activities to keep players engaged for countless hours. Whether you're indulging in high-stakes heists that require meticulous planning, partaking in adrenaline-pumping races across land, sea, and air, or simply enjoying the laid-back pastimes like tennis, golf, and yoga, there's something for every kind of player.  The online component, Grand Theft Auto Online, elevates the game even further, providing an expansive multiplayer playground that invites you to team up with friends or compete against others in a wide range of activities. The continuous updates and content additions from Rockstar ensure that the experience remains fresh and exciting, keeping players coming back for more.  Visually, GTA V is a masterpiece. The level of detail in the graphics, especially on modern hardware, is simply breathtaking. The world comes alive with stunningly realistic lighting, weather effects, and meticulously crafted environments. The attention to detail extends to the character models, vehicles, and every facet of the game's design, contributing to an immersive and visually captivating experience.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a triumph in game design, storytelling, and open-world exploration. Its unparalleled attention to detail, engrossing narrative, and wealth of content make it a must-play title for gamers of all kinds. Rockstar Games has delivered a true masterpiece that has set a new standard for open-world gaming, and it's an experience that no gamer should miss."

gta online doest even work game is like shit honestly!!
"[h1]Grand Theft Auto V - A Dizzying Descent into Gratuitous Violence and Societal Decay[/h1]  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) stands as a prime example of a game that prioritizes shock value and gratuitous violence over meaningful storytelling and responsible gameplay. While the series has garnered a massive following for its open-world environments and sandbox gameplay, GTA V takes the worst aspects of its predecessors and amplifies them to an alarming degree, creating a virtual playground that revels in immoral behavior and contributes to a troubling cultural landscape.  From the outset, GTA V showcases a narrative that glorifies criminality and glamorizes antisocial behavior. The protagonists are a trio of morally bankrupt individuals, each embroiled in a web of crime, violence, and corruption. While the concept of playing as antiheroes is not inherently problematic, GTA V crosses a line by portraying their actions as humorous and entertaining, rather than exploring the consequences of their choices. This lack of nuance and depth undermines any potential for meaningful character development, reducing the story to a series of shockingly violent and exploitative set pieces.  One of the most concerning aspects of GTA V is its unrelenting focus on violence and degradation. The game offers players a staggering array of weapons to wreak havoc upon the game world, from firearms and explosives to melee weapons. This arsenal is used not just against rival gangs or law enforcement, but also against innocent pedestrians and bystanders who are treated as little more than collateral damage. The game's missions often involve acts of brutality, from torture sequences to heinous acts of cruelty, further reinforcing the idea that violence is not only acceptable but also integral to progressing in the game.  Furthermore, GTA V's open-world environment encourages players to engage in rampant destruction and chaos without any meaningful consequences. The game's mechanics actively reward players for causing mayhem, such as earning money from committing crimes and evading the police. This encourages a toxic cycle of behavior that normalizes criminality and recklessness, undermining any semblance of ethical gameplay.  The game's treatment of women is particularly troubling, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and objectification. Female characters are often reduced to one-dimensional roles, existing solely for the purpose of providing sexual gratification or as mere plot devices. The pervasive misogyny extends to the game's humor, which frequently relies on offensive and degrading jokes that reinforce harmful attitudes toward women.  Beyond its narrative and thematic concerns, GTA V also suffers from technical issues and a lack of innovation. The game's character models and animations appear outdated and stiff, failing to match the level of graphical fidelity expected from a modern title. The open-world environment, while expansive, often feels lifeless and devoid of meaningful interactions, leading to a sense of emptiness and repetitiveness. The online component, Grand Theft Auto Online, is plagued with microtransactions and a persistent grind that favors players willing to spend real money to progress, further contributing to a sense of exploitation and unfairness.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V exemplifies a disturbing trend in the gaming industry where shock value and gratuitous violence take precedence over responsible storytelling and thoughtful gameplay. The game's glorification of criminal behavior, exploitation of vulnerable themes, and overall lack of accountability contribute to a toxic gaming culture that normalizes antisocial actions and undermines the potential for meaningful experiences. Rather than pushing boundaries in a positive direction, GTA V succumbs to the worst impulses of its creators, resulting in a game that is more harmful than entertaining. As a reflection of societal values and cultural impact, GTA V stands as a stark reminder of the need for responsible and thoughtful game design that prioritizes the well-being of players and the broader gaming community."
Good old GTA V   :)

"It's definitely fun. Online you need like. Kiddion's or something to save yourself from getting killed., kicked, and banned. So many hackers it's wild. BUT if you can manage to get into an empty lobby with friends and play the game it's super satisfying and the heists are really fun."
osam game for fun
You can load into a public lobby on startup and lose all money you've earned due to cheaters. Never touching this garbage again.
"Its gta 5, what else could i say?"

WDWDAD
One of the best games of all time and we all know that. But please just let it die and give us GTA 6.
"Really good game, the only downside is there is no megawalletburner shark card than costs $50,000. I really want to give every cent I ever earn to this cooperation for making a basically bug free game. Also, If I give rockstar more money then they will forget to patch bugs and add anything to the game so it stays the way it is."

i think that GTA V is a game that every single gamer should play regardless of what style of games you normally play because it is arguably the greatest game ever.
hella modders but otherwise not bad

"Nice game but becomes boring eventually as there aren't any big updates regarding gameplay and also rockstar adds new content very less frequently, I hope it will get better as GTA RP merges with Rockstar."
grad thetf auto :steamhappy:
"great game with many way to spend time, story mode is by itself worth buying the game, and possibilities are limitless in the online gameplay, I've spent 185 hours in game mostly in single player trying to unlock everything without any internet help and I still find new things to do."

"Very good game with good graphics and storyline, 10/10 would recommend you play this."
"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) stands as an unparalleled masterpiece in the world of gaming, delivering an immersive experience that has set new standards for open-world gameplay. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this installment, showcasing their expertise in storytelling, game mechanics, and world-building. As a devoted player, I can confidently award GTA 5 a well-deserved 5-star rating.  The first aspect that strikes players is the meticulously crafted world of Los Santos and Blaine County. The level of detail is astonishing, with every nook and cranny teeming with life, from bustling city streets to serene countryside landscapes. The sheer scope of the map, coupled with the seamless transition between urban and rural environments, creates a living, breathing world that feels genuine and alive.  The game's narrative is another standout feature. The interwoven stories of three distinct protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor - bring a refreshing dynamic to the traditional GTA formula. Each character has their own unique background, motivations, and quirks, adding layers of complexity to the storyline. Rockstar's signature satire and social commentary are well-presented, making the narrative both engaging and thought-provoking.  Gameplay mechanics in GTA 5 are nothing short of exceptional. The driving mechanics strike a perfect balance between realism and fun, ensuring that vehicular mayhem remains as entertaining as ever. Shooting mechanics are smooth and responsive, enhancing the action-packed sequences that the series is renowned for. The addition of heists adds an extra layer of strategy and excitement, enabling players to meticulously plan and execute high-stakes robberies with their chosen crew.  What truly sets GTA 5 apart is the online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online. It's a sprawling universe in its own right, offering players the chance to explore Los Santos with their friends, engage in various activities, and even create their own content. The consistent updates and additions by Rockstar have kept the online community vibrant and ever-evolving.  Graphically, GTA 5 continues to amaze even years after its initial release. The attention to detail, realistic lighting, and meticulous character animations create an immersive experience that stands the test of time. The level of optimization on various platforms is commendable, ensuring that players across different systems can enjoy the game without compromising on visual quality.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a magnum opus in the gaming world. Its combination of a richly detailed open world, engaging characters, gripping narrative, and diverse gameplay mechanics make it a landmark achievement. Whether you're a fan of action, storytelling, exploration, or simply causing virtual chaos, GTA 5 offers an unforgettable experience. Without a doubt, it deserves a perfect 5-star rating for its lasting impact on the gaming industry."

"1) симулятор подключения к серверу 2) симулятор инициализации  3) симулятор подключение к GTA5 Online 4) каждый третий тип - это читер который скинет тебе на голову мильйон горящих самолётов и уебёт тебя 30 раз подряд потому что он может это сделать 5) Чтобы ограбить с друзьями банк, нужно помолиться сатане, отсосать 3 мужикам, поставить 10 свечек в церкве и начинать миссию в полнолуние  А так в целом, забавно"

"When I was growing up I couldn't really play these kinds of video games in my mother's household. I never bothered to play this game at a friend's house either. I just never got around to it. That was until I turned 20 years old and moved out of my parents' house and into my own apartment. I found this game on sale and I figured why not get it. After 80 hours into this game (barely touched the multiplayer mind you) I'm in love with the single player campaign. I'm glad I never played this game until I turned 20 because not only am I free from having to look over my shoulder when I'm at the strip club, but I understand jokes and references 14 year old me would've never understood. The campaign is hilarious and really fun to play and I know i'm 10 years behind on all of this but I waited long enough to finally play this game that my parents banned with extreme predjudice."
If games counted for real world war crimes id have a triple life sentence.
its fun but would be better with gta 6
Overall Good Just make sure not to use mods

if any indian player is here who wanna play then plzzzzzz play with me i'm bored now playing gta online alone and with other countries players
"Oh, Grand Theft Auto V, you wild, sussy, and absolutely ridiculous masterpiece. Buckle up, babes, 'cause we're about to dive into the zaniest world this side of Ohio! Lemme tell ya, when I first loaded up this game, I was like ""nahhhhh, they didn't just go there!"" But they did, and I forgor all my worries 'cause I was bout to come on this epic adventure, gang gang!  The moment I stepped into Los Santos, I felt like an amogus in a world full of swaggy chaos. I mean, seriously, where else can you casually jack a car, chase a train, and rob a convenience store in one go? It's like a real-life favorite meme compilation, except you're in control of the madness. Yummers!  But let's talk about them characters, fam. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin – what a trio! Michael's like that older femboy in the hood, tryna keep it lowkey but ending up in the wildest heists. Trevor? Oh my days, that man is pure chaotic energy. Every time he's on screen, it's an ""ermm yoinks!"" moment, and you just can't help but love the crazy mofo.  And speaking of NPCs, oh boy, they're a whole mood. You'll find 'em bing chilling on the streets, saying some of the most random stuff. It's like they're all part of a secret Ohio club or something. You'll be walking along, and some dude just hits you with a ""scrumptious!"" line outta nowhere. Only in GTA V, I tell ya.  The city itself, Los Santos, is a work of art, so vibrant and full of life. From the posh neighborhoods to the gritty back alleys, it's a melting pot of weird and wonderful. You can even switch between characters, which is like being in multiple places at once, being your own femboy army – zesty times indeed!  But let's be real, sometimes the game's humor can be a bit ""NPC"" level, like they're trying too hard to be funny. And those loading screens, ugh, they're longer than a cross-country road trip from Ohio to California. But hey, nothing's perfect, right?  In the end, Grand Theft Auto V is a sussy rollercoaster of chaos and adventure, a game that leaves you laughing, scratching your head, and yelling ""when the impostor is sus!"" all in one sitting. It's a classic that's imprinted its mark on gaming culture, and you can't deny its impact. So, if you haven't played it yet, what are you waiting for? Hop in, fam, and let's go on a wild, goofy ahh ride through the crazy streets of Los Santos!"

"GTA Online was the best and worst thing to happen to rockstar Made them lazy and complacent since they can just print money cause of the mindless kids who enjoy wasting money on that sort of thing  But not all is Negative and most of my salt comes from the fact we will probably never see a DLC to the story of any rockstar game cause theres no way for them to monetize it  The story in this is phenomenal such an incredible performance from all the voice actors and talent  One of the prettier games ever made as well I wish there was a ""mixed"" review button cause most of my hate and infuriation with the game really comes from love,but i have never been a fan of how GTA Online works at all and that will probably never change,unlike rockstar lmao"
"In comparison to it's predecessor, GTA IV, it has significant downgrades in it's physics engine and driving mechanics. The story mode doesn't get anywhere near as dark but it introduces many new fun mechanics. If you're strictly interested in the single player experience, I would honestly recommend GTA IV first. That being said, for people more interested in multiplayer, GTA V's online experience suffers from many issues, steer away from public lobbies. The game has fallen off and all of their content released after 2017 has only contributed to it's downfall.  The only reason I can recommend this game is because despite it's shortcomings and terrible updates, it still has a lot to offer and is typically on sale for $15 or less. Just buy it, it's been nearly 10 years."
its a great game but too many hackers
keep it coming
good game for running around and some nice missions even better with friends
need fast internet for a good game
coc
Delicois

GAME TAKES 4 WEEKS TO LOAD INTO ONLINE
bootylicious
it is very fun with friends :) ;) :)
great when you play FiveM
ALL
i love the games stistis and all the above
"this game has quite the reputation, but the gameplay is something you have to find out for yourself. it is quite the grind to get money and buy things, but I enjoy almost all aspects of it"
#kill level 10s and under
I've invested 6 hours into this game only to find that the game has progression issues attempting one of the story line quests only ends in a glitch and then have quit the game and tried multiple time to try to advance and get the glitch each time I've requested a refund and i'm probably going to get told its over the 2 hour limit this bs steam says is a policy well steam you a holes what happens if the problem doesn't happen until later in the game   fix your policy
this game sucks shit harder than a black hole
It only works once in a while but I still cant play online mode
Pretty great game. I liked the story and it's ending. Ten years on and the graphics still look good.
"They have ruined the game 2 years after release gta ONLINE atleast. They made it pay to play and to grind is IMPOSSIBLE. To put it into perspective most ""decent"" cars are $1m or more, a normal mission takes about 15 minutes to complete and you get 15k TOPS.  The average guy cannot play this game and enjoy it you would have to make it your life over 40 hrs a week.  Also they ban people for no reason, and if there is a good reason they will not share it with you or talk to you about it, so hope you dont sell 2 many cars or get a griefer modder to drop u cash or something without your intent,  cuz your account will be gone.  Happened to me 2 times after years of playing.  Single player is the best but the bad side is, they havnt done ANYTHING to it since the release so u got a day of enjoyment there and its over."
"play it a lot, but the fun is always very limited. all the setup mission take away from the fun of the heists. also the world feels big but empty"

One of the games of all time
"I would die for Chop, he's so cute. Also maybe one of the best stories ever told in a video game."
Online mode is fun - definitely need to get a client to block people from remote ejecting and remote teleporting you while you play. Frustrating.
very good. 1.5/2
"Dog, how the fuck do I play this thing"
The games good; the only tip I could give it to stay in singleplayer till you finish it and go into Online later. Its not as bad as people say.
gameplay and characters. Overall layout.
Fun to fuck around in

"Could be better / add a feature to go to north yankton just by flying a plane to it, so you don't gotta glitch it in, but overall good game :)"

"gta 5 onlilne i hate because of taking long time to get in the game ""worst"""
"It was good 10 years ago when it just came out. Now it is a cash cow for Cockstar games. They plan to milk it till yall turn 40. It would at least be okay if not for griefers and modders, and RS does nothing to address that. Gonna wait till they come out with GTA 6"
god game cant say nun about it fo so
"It's an alright game. A little too open worldy for me though, I can never manage to progress linearly.  I just steal cars, shoot at stuff, and log off for a couple weeks."
"Very good, lovely game for all. I would want you to play it"
Funny realistic game

Very entertaining and great for long gaming sessions. I would give it 4 stars due to it being such an immersive game with so much to do. Only down side is there are so many hackers that you can sometimes find it difficult to play.

"Nice game,very god job RockStar"
the memory of the childhood
"Dont waste your time. All it takes is someone to hack your **** and rockstar does nothing to help you recover it. Absolute theft, waste of time, and money at this point."
"Its a great game, i love the pvp in online but im having an issue with loading in, i can load up GTA but it uses Rockstar games to load up and it just locks itself and i cant play. Other than that 100% recomend GTA V"
"This game is really fun. I think you'll enjoy it aswell, well I hope you do."

Better controls than console.
"Grand Theft Auto V is a sandbox game that takes place in the streets in the fictional crime city of Los Santos (based upon los angeles). Within the game, you can complete missions, heists, own businesses, and one of my favorites: commit mass genocide upon innocent civilians. All jokes aside, GTA is one of my favorite games, just because of the wide variety of content that it offers. You can really do almost anything crime-related that you see in movies, ranging from escaping the cops in a high-speed police pursuit, to robbing the richest man on earth.        The game has two entirely separate parts. There's the story mode, and the online mode. For a person who enjoys a compelling adventure, story mode has one of the best experiences gaming has to offer, with you being able to play the role as a criminal millionaire father of two millennial kids (Michael), a physco named Trevor, or a nice but rough gangster who goes by Franklin.        The online version on the other hand, puts you in a server with around 30 other people, offering a different experience entirely. While you can still do things like rob stores, do heists, and run businesses, the goal of the online version is to simply aquire as much money as possible, and grief other players with the most overpowered vehicles and weapons the game has to offer. This version requires A LOT more time and dedication than the story mode to really do anything, and the grinding that is needed to earn any substantial amount of money is gruesome and tedius. If you don't have irl money to just buy your way up the ranks, or enough time for the insane amount of grinding, I would just focus on the story mode.   Overall, Both aspects of the game are cool, but I'd say the story mode is where the real fun is at. The game doesn't cost much money, and tbh it gives you a pretty good bang for your buck, so I personally would recommend getting it. Anywho that was my opinion. hope ya'll have a good one. peace"
grinding stinky no money everything expense and no money but grind impossible dum doodoo buttere
"This game is amazing, I only played the campaign but got 40 hours worth of it. This game is definitely a masterpiece"

I love this game so much. Only thing is that the black people are allowed to roam around freely without han
"shitty ass log in process, progress lost after steam shut down. unplayable game due to different social club account. should've used the crack instead of this shit"
"Currently sitting at 22 hours played, and I can assure you that 20 hours was just me driving a taxi and hitting everything I could (not on purpose). Will play more :thumbsup:"
rockstar got so fat off of the gta online money that they completely stopped caring about all of their games all they want is you to spend money so it makes your grind easier very fun to play with friends and drive around but even that has gotten stale after a decade of playing gta online.
now i can not play anymore
4.5 the reason i aint give it a 5 star because WHERE IS GTA 6 AT!!!! but overall this is a Amazing game
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"One of the worst games with online i have ever played. Keep disconnecting from sessions, tons of hackers (around 3 per session with luck, never without) and horrible loading screens."

"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠿⠿⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢺⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠆⠜⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠿⠛⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⡏⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⣶⣶⣶⣶⣶⣦⣤⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⢠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢿⡧⠇⢀⣤⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣾⣮⣭⣿⡻⣽⣒⠀⣤⣜⣭⠐⢐⣒⠢⢰⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣏⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⣾⣿⠂⢈⢿⣷⣞⣸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣽⣿⣿⣷⣶⣾⡿⠿⣿⠗⠈⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠻⠋⠉⠑⠀⠀⢘⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⢹⣿⣿⡇⢀⣶⣶⠴⠶⠀⠀⢽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⠀⠀⠣⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡟⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⣿⣧⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡀⣴⠁⢘⡙⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠙⢿⠗⠂⠄⠀⣴⡟⠀⠀⡃⠀⠉⠉⠟⡿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢷⠾⠛⠂⢹⠀⠀⠀⢡⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠛⠿⢿"

"This could have been ""The best GTA"" or even game of the decade thanks to the Online mode.  Sadly something happened to Rockstar Games it seems and they went from one of the most inspiring studio in the game industry to something similar to ubisoft or activision.  Online has been full of hackers and bugs for about 8 years now and nothing changed since almost day one.  Between bugs and hackers, ""if stars align"" you can spend 4h ""not playing the game"" despite playing it."
this game is good btw i think ill rate the first mission 10\10

"I don't know why I still play this game, especially when I can't get laid :("
"FINALLY  I've completed this title a second time now since I completed it in the Xbox 360.  There's not much to say really. Everybody knows GTA V. It's a classic now, I would say. Great story, great mechanics and great soundtrack. A campaign that I've replayed a thousand times already because of how good it is.  On the other hand, I really like GTA Online, but I feel Rockstar has not been the same since all the attention went down only to this section. I would've wanted a more balanced way of dealing with the other games in the company, like releasing a good remaster of the GTA trilogy, to add content to RDO or to simply make new games like they used to. I'm sad about the way the company is right now, and one can only hope they were what they used to be years ago."

宗教と政治はしばしば一部の人々にすべての視点を失い、感情的な子供のように怒鳴り、絶賛し、続けることに道を譲ります。彼らは理性を持ってそれを議論することを拒否するか、そうでなければ彼らは議論を行うための地獄の方法である議論の人身攻撃を好むかのどちらかです。まあ、とにかく、少し前に私は選挙と、キャンペーンがどのように問題を無視し、代わりに攻撃的で個人的ながらくたに固執しているかについて話していましたそれは政府を運営することの実質的な問題とは何の関係もありませんでした(あなたが候補者のスピーチといわゆる討論に従ったならばあなたが知っているように、それはすべて真実です)。とにかく、私が話していた男の一人は、彼が突然笑って、私たち全員がshtでいっぱいだと言ったときを除いて、会話全体で一言も言わなかった、そしてそれが私たち全員がアメリカ合衆国を憎む方法だったのなら、なぜ私たち全員がロシアや中国に住まなかったのか!次にあなたが知っていることは、咲く議論全体が乱闘のようであり、形容詞は厚くそして速く飛んで、騒音は信じられないほどでした!誰かが「雌犬の息子」と言った、そして私は彼が「ろくでなし!」と言ったと思う。(私は確信が持てませんでした;それはすべてとても混乱していました。まあ、とにかく、私はそれをすべて合理的なレベルに戻そうとしていました。たとえば、私はそれをすべて始めた人と話をしようとしました、そして私は彼に私たちが皆たわごとでいっぱいであるとはどういう意味ですか?彼はそれを知っていたように事実の陳述をしていましたか、そして彼の主張を裏付ける彼の文書はどこにありましたか?ソクラテスは私が彼の議論に反論した方法を誇りに思っていただろうと思います。つまり、私はそれに反論しようとしました。しかし、彼が反論として提供できたのは、私たち全員がたわごとでいっぱいだったことについて、もっと同じでした。しかし、彼は理由を言いませんでした。彼はただそれを繰り返し続けました。それとロシアと中国と共産主義のカモについての部分。そして、私は少し腹を立てて、彼のアイデアを彼のお尻に詰め込むように彼に言ったことを告白しなければなりません(あなたが私に言う必要はありませんが、議論で誰かを説得する方法はほとんどありません)。それから彼は塩辛くなり、私が黙らなければ私に口にパンチを与えると脅しました。そして、私は本当に熱くなり、他の人も熱くなりました。そして、私たちは皆、保守党氏のshtを打ち負かしました。そして、結局のところ、彼は非難されるのは自分自身だけでした。これはまだ自由な国であり、私のような仲間に「兄弟、あなたはsh * tでいっぱいです」と言う人は誰でも、理由を言うかどうか尋ねられたときに丁寧に答える準備ができています!
this game is nice game
"Alright, let's get one thing straight – the story in GTA V? Yeah, it's like it was given to a 16 years old pi*mp to write it, it's a hot mess that even a Brain death wouldn't write. But hold up, before you go running for the hills, this game still shines brighter than a supernova.  I mean, come on, we're talking about a game made by Rockstar. It's like Rockstar read the book of mayhem, tore it up, and rewrote it with a rocket launcher in hand. And hey, let's not forget that the online chaos is like a never-ending party in the underworld.  Sure, the story might be a dumpster fire, but let's not kid ourselves – this game is like an old buddy from way back when. Nostalgia hits you harder than a freight train, and you can't help but remember the good times you've had with this bad boy. I've practically lived, breathed, and thrown controllers at the screen because of this game. It's the kind of nostalgia trip that makes you wanna hug your console and thank it for all the hours of pure insanity.  So, let's cut the crap and give credit where it's due. GTA V might have a story that's more messed up than a pi*mp on caffeine, but damn, it's the kind of mess we can't help but love. It's like that crazy ex you can't forget – infuriating and irresistible at the same damn time. So grab your weapons, rev up those engines, and dive headfirst into the chaos, because this game is a wild ride you won't want to miss."
Great with friends
It Fun
this game not working
i like this game has a very good story and characters a good lite enviroment and liteing
"dsibfilwgf w k,dsjvgyugfweiuks"
the main story is grate and all but the online is not worth it in there are lots and lots of hackers
"Great graphics, and a great way to get lost in a different world.  Tip, when buying a DLC pack, it can take a few days for it to load up into your game."
I have owned this game 6 times on many different consoles and I still play it 🗿
I bought the game and I lost my email to the social club account. I can't play the game anymore and I can't even refund it
the tits on the strippers are too small.
Don't get it until HSW (Hao Special works) are for pc. (basically makes vehicles significantly faster on xbox and ps4.) its part of the next gen thing for gta. We need that for Gta Online PC. Until than I'd reccomend waiting till getting the game unless you're not here for speed.
please spare my sanity

I don't play for a year and I come back and it is asking me for a activation code which I already did and it is now saying that it is already in use for whatever reason you can see with achievements for this game I have completed the first mission so I have already activated the code. Not a clue
crime and homicide 👍
i hate the fact i cant play this on mac
"Ask me in 2012, yes. But the state that the game is in today is just a shadow of what it used to be. It's insidious how every single action in the game silently nudges you to buy more shark cards, even in single player. It sours the entire experience."
"launcher never works, i tried it for the first time in over a year and not only could i not play the game i paid for back then, i can't play it now either.  i've done multiple fresh installs on multiple OS's and it's never worked.  i never had an issue before the launcher came into existence hence the hours I've played up to now."

Yes I do recommend this game. I mean yeah it came out in 2013 but that's not important. This game is still popular and is a lot of fun with mods and especially graphics mods.
i like this game but gta 6 should alr be out

"too many bugs, scummy company, also £50 for rdr1 original on ps4?!?!  cant even get into a game without some pathetic losers modding or being griefers. Just play the goddamn game"
"Would be a nice game, IF I COULD PLAY IT  This whole damn system with having to connect your rockstar games social club thing is such a stupid thing.  I don't even know why I am still trying, spoke to 5 different rockstar support employee's, all of them saying not helping one bit. I'm now 16 days in on a rockstar games support ticket involving Social Club. They have a terrible support system. Took me about 10 minutes to even find the correct support area, and another 5 to create one...  STOP THIS SOCIAL CLUB STUFF, IT IS WORTHLESS  I have 10.6 hours on record, of which 7.5 hours are from me trying to get this social club shit to work. Real fun game Rockstar, should've stayed on my damn PS4 where you don't have this social club mess"

"If you are looking to play story, get it for it is awesome.  The online is only full of modders and hackers. Most of them are docile, but it takes the fun and challenge away from the game. I enjoy playing games how they are made to be played. this game is better on console.  I would not recommend the online experience to people, unless you yourself are a hacker/modder."

"Had a lot of fun playing Grand Theft Auto 5, the missions were interesting, funny and fairly easy. Grand Theft Auto Online is also fun to play, even tho all those tryhards and modders are a pain in the ass. For me personally I don't really like to play it alone, I can't find anything I could do, except for doing cargo. Which gets boring after some time, or play missions with randoms, you either get lucky or unlucky with them.  But all in all, it's a great game, love to play it."
Best Game Ever Created
"So I bought the ""Great White Shark: GTA$1,500,000 - $19.99"" and it has not showed up in game. Is there something I need to do first before receiving it in game?"
"fun,"
Nie jest to grywalne na PC ale jak nie mam konsoli to nie mam wyboru xD
I Do not recommend this game to any one. Rockstar has the worse Customer service i have ever seen.  After taking a year off from playing i signed back in to find the email that was attached to the account to be wrong so i was unable to sign in i contacted customer support and have been dealing with them for over 2 months and they keep going in circles and not helping.  At this point i have uninstalled all the their games from my computer.

Best loading screen simulator since september 2013.
dont buy it from steam its not able to launch via rockstar game and you will not get any support from them as well
"GTAV story mode has dozens of hours worth of content to offer, and i have to point out that i don't personally know anyone who attained a 100% completion yet. That's just about where the fun ends; GTA Online is completely broken, and instead of fixing known issues, Rockstar games keeps adding new content that breaks the game even more.  all the new content that Rockstar Games adds is boring, there's nothing interesting. all the latest missions basically force you to use heavy weapons like minigun, RPG, etc. which gets boring very quickly. It's straight up impossible to finish them with a simple assault rifle, whether it's caused by a dozen enemies spawning at your own spawn point, or the fact that the NPCs have an absurd accuracy and can give you a headshot even when they don't see you through the bushes.  Old content has few missions that keep repeating over and over and become repetitive very quickly - at this point I am doing them just for the money, and even then i often don't want to launch them.  Public online sessions are unplayable, you have about an 80% chance of joining a lobby with a cheater who will teleport you all across the map against your will, lock you in a cage, explode you, or even give you modded money which can easily result in you getting banned and having your entire progress reset. Rockstar games has supposedly done some changes recently, but I have not noticed any difference, same goes for my friends.  I couldn't forget to mention how Rockstar games has recently removed almost 200 old vehicles with no rational explanation. They are now incredibly difficult or impossible to obtain, even though many of them were very popular in the playerbase. The reasoning Rockstar games has given us is that ""they wanted to remove vehicles that weren't being purchased very often, to reduce how much we would have to scroll on the websites.""  GTA Online also used to have many different competitive jobs, especially adversary modes. I remember browsing through a list of hundreds of different adversary modes the game had to offer. Recently I have come to the horrible discovery that Rockstar games has yet again deleted the old content and that the list now contains barely 60 adversary modes, and exactly none of the ones i used to play. I haven't found any announcement about this anywhere, only people complaining about it and being equally as confused as me  TL;DR: this game is absolutely not worth buying in 2023 and onward, and that's coming from someone who's been playing since 2016. If you do want to get it, do yourself a favor and wait for a sale"
"The community in this game sucks. Not only are the developers mentally limited, no, the players are too. In addition, it is very likely that they play the game with a blindfold and their feet instead of hands. There is no other way to explain how you can be so incredibly dog shit at a game this easy."
"great game with FiveM, been loving it"
gta v is love

"I don't understand how Rockstar can make 6 sequels to this game and still have a non-functioning and confusing system for searching and working with the account, I've been trying to log in to my account for two days and when I type in the correct account and password, it confirms that the account exists and it will send me to hell"

It's a great game with online features ruined by going to far with sci-fi and action type vehicles and guns. Keep it simple.
Removing content that was already in the game and throwing a paywall in front of it... Take Two wants to kill every ounce of respect us fans have for them. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ROCKSTAR OR TAKE TWO!!

I love this game as you tell I haven't gotten any hours playing this game while im writing this but i played this game back in the day on the PS4 and on EpicGames and i love how this just makes me so happy and how i got most of my memoirs from this games on PS4 with old friends. Amazing

garbage company. garbage game. too many bugs. too many horrendous choices by the devs. dont support r*
"IT WILL NEVER DIE  and u get 3 games in one five M, STORY MODE, AND ONLINE it will never die but never grow in popularity as it used to"
The game always gets stuck on infinite loading screens. Also it always has problems launching.
"Its alright, but the online story is a bit long"
VEHLE
"Don't read any reviews. Except this one. So, the game is great, very fun, jokes all hit, it's aged well. Best of all, my potato of a PC can surprisingly handle it, so for all you potato pcs out there, if you have 100GB of space and 8GB+ of RAM, you're good to go."
Its Gta and you are trash
video game
why cant i run over civilians in peace >:(
"Not bad but the servers are bad, sometimes in online your game crashes and when u go inside a building it takes long and a black screen. Still, the games is quite good."

"being a Mormon i take my grand thrift auto  game play very serious, i like to dress in black and pretend im going door to door saving the souls of the lost heathens i come in contact with. It makes me feel saintly and once i reach saint hood i like to go around kicking puppies and diddling prostitutes, because im better than all of you."
Those Mk2 griefers are annoying ngl

"great game, lots of content to do. but be prepared to grind and grind if you want the money to buy businesses etc. dont buy shark cards though"
this game is amazing heists the best thing ever
This game is so so so so so fun to play this is the best game i played.

pretty cool game cars are fun also heists are cool
I LOVE THIS GAME OMH!!!!!!!!!
one of the best game in the world
game is overall shit but online is fun
"Honestly at this point i would not recommend GTA V it has been 10 Years and it just has a lot of issues. Leveling up in the LS Car meet takes an insane amount of time their is no fast way to do it, unless you wanna leave you PC on idle for hours to unlock car meet exclusive liveries. The Dre contract while it can earn you a good amount of money the 40 minute cool down or so really kinda kills it. This game has really become more of a cool down simulator where you always have a timer before you can make big money. Which is of course intentional because shark cards exist and they want you to buy those. Grinding is very tedious in this game. so many vehicles and customization's are locked behind other items you have to purchase which could be really annoying. The heists are a good way to make money, but if you have no one to play with it can be difficult to do alone and at times just are not worth it. Now GTA V can be fun to play online with friends and the story is not terrible by any means. But all the stupid tactics they use to make everything as annoying as possible in hopes that you will buy their shark cards is well unbearable at times. I have put many hours into this, most of it is from idle leveling in the ls car meet. Not really worth it though. You also can not have more than one vehicle out at a time which is frustrating. It should allow you to have at  least your car and jet out at the same time. You also can not fast travel to your own,owned properties. The cut scenes for missions and heists are not skippable because of how they were developed also you can not turn off dialogue alone because it is mixed with the SFX and listening to Lester and Franklin, Dre etc gets really old really fast."
we need more roleplay options

"Too buggy, cant have a single play session be a smooth experience"
this game fun
coool game
"too bad game when your account can be stolen, ass support"
"its just my computer but i think i built it weird so now i cant playt without lagging and typing this is laggy too, my pc has 3 terrabytes of storage and 4 sticks of ram so idk what i did, maybe the game is too advanced for my little brain, great game tho if i could actually play it i love riding around and doing quests its just something to do after football everyday, but i struggle so imma stop playing til i save for a good prebuilt pc instead so i dont mess it up. def reccomed."
great game lots of things too do  open pvp and sandbox both online and ofline uses available
this game is 10 year old and still good
"uh, rockstar bad blah blah. Seriously though, been playing since 2013 release and having my account wiped 3 times isn't funny."

"I like this game just a little. havent played it much tho need to update, stay tuned"
hehehehheh
very fun except when they ban you for hacks when your not hacking.
it's good but i don't play a lot
"I can't support Rockstar Games anymore even though it's my favorite franchise. The link between Rockstar Games Launcher and Steam worked fine in the past but I have now spent over 8 hours in customer support trying to get my game to launch. Rockstar support had me change everything possible about my internet connection, delete and reinstall game files, etc. It should not be impossible to launch a game."
good game but they should add building
good game. bugs still exists and modders too but still good
FUCKING CHINESE cheating shit.
I hate this game because im bad ad it

good for stress relief

very good love this game
I liked the scene when I first saw trevor
"The Rockstar games launcher is a virtual fucking hemmorrhoid, and R* also apparently removed a large amount of content in a recent update just so they can dripfeed it back in as ""new"" content. Single player was abandoned nearly a decade ago in favour of the literal billions in microtransactions that Online brings R*'s parent company, which is honestly a shame because I would have loved to see more expansions similar to what GTA IV had."
top quality game
ITS DOPE
its  good gamefor 4 year olds

its fun lol its very involved so many choices of how you play the game lots of job choices can be a slow start two start making decent money buy the deluxe pack it will make starting out a bit easier on sale it can be cheap   the things i don't like every thing costs so much its like they encourage buying money in their store a bit two hard every thing is expensive but the game is addictive fun

"Peanut Butter Cookies  Ingredients 1 cup unsalted butter 1 cup crunchy peanut butter 1 cup white sugar 1 cup packed brown sugar 2 large eggs 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder ½ teaspoon salt Directions Beat butter, peanut butter, white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth; beat in eggs. Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into butter mixture until dough is just combined. Chill cookie dough in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll dough into 1-inch balls and place 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten each ball with a fork, making a crisscross pattern. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 10 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets briefly before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. (nice game tho)"
Giant open world and loads of things to do. Would recommend.

"""Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) is an exhilarating open-world action-adventure game that captivates players with its sprawling virtual world and immersive gameplay. Set in the fictional city of Los Santos, the game offers a richly detailed environment where players can freely explore, engage in various activities, and embark on a gripping criminal narrative.  The game boasts stunning graphics and attention to detail that bring the city to life, from bustling urban streets to serene countryside landscapes. The variety of characters, each with their own stories, adds depth to the narrative, making for a compelling single-player experience.  GTA 5's gameplay is a seamless blend of story missions, heists, and a myriad of side activities. Whether driving high-speed vehicles, participating in thrilling shootouts, or just enjoying leisurely pastimes like tennis or golf, there's never a dull moment. The diverse range of vehicles, weapons, and customization options ensures that players can tailor their experience to suit their preferences.  One highlight of GTA 5 is the innovative ""GTA Online"" mode, offering a dynamic multiplayer environment. Friends can team up to tackle missions, races, and challenges, or engage in more chaotic activities like open-world mayhem and heists. The constant updates and new content injected into the online world keep the experience fresh and exciting.  While GTA 5's storyline and gameplay are undeniably engaging, it's important to note that the game's mature themes, including violence, crime, and adult content, may not be suitable for all audiences. Despite this, GTA 5 remains a standout title in the gaming world, offering a blend of action, exploration, and storytelling that continues to captivate players."""
"it's a nice game, can't wait for gta IV"
Someone hacked my online account and Rockstar aint dooone shit bout it......
"Game is fine, but rockstar is what the issue is.  You get all your stuff wiped for a single offence, even if you played for like 3000 hours legit with no cheats and no trainers.  They cant even tell what you did wrong and offer no appeal.  And still, rockstar cant handle real griefers, modders, cheaters, you name it.  Really dont think i'll buy gta 6..."
I've played the game since release and have done everything you can imagine on it even been playing fivem follow me on IG @ioxytv
"It is awesome and fun playing with your friends. If anything funny or crazy happens, I suggest you make sure you have action replay on."
i had a lot of fun online.in online mode you get free money and i got 25000000 dollers
um a lot of naked humans
w game but i think the cops are racist
Great game with tons of things to do to keep me entertained. If there is one thing I love about a game is that it doesn't get boring after playing for a few hours.
lot of griefing and modders. 👍
great game I have played it since it came out and i still love it.

"uh.. I don't know.. I'm going so fast, that I can't even comprehend how good it is. Probably.  - Yuno / Speedrunner 2023"
"It's a good game, but the in-game waiting time is too long due to cheat users, non-manner players, in-game matching system issues or illegal program users. Therefore, I have no intention of recommending it"
"Story is okay, Online is meh (Red dead online had an actually good story for the online mode lol)"

game wont fucking start because of daniel
great game so far no real complaints
I FUCKING HATE CHEATERS WHO ACT LIKE 3 YEAR OLDS WHEN I KILL THEM AND CRASH MY GAME GOD DAMN IT
The games pretty good for mid range to ok pcs so if you have more than 2 cores and at least 8 gb ram you can run it at like 30 fps like on the 360 but go into a invite only session unless you want mod menu trollers EDIT i meant if you dont want trollers in your game
Just not into it anymore
obviously its good
good game but the mission with red car u have to cap fps below 130 or you lose
skikkelig funny
ang tagal ng loading
amazing shoe store
The absolute best game ever. I get to dress like a slut and nobody says anything.
blowing up strip clubs are fun
gta online is chaotic and i love it
the online mode is not optimeszed well for a game over a decade old. I encounter glitchs at least 2 times an hour. is only fun with freinds.

If you wan't to play this online. DONT Rockstar doesn't give a shit about the cheaters that make the majority of its playerbase.  They don't care about the former because of the latter.  Rockstar won't even let you contact them to make a formal complaint.  They don't want to hear it.  So get this review instead.  Mechanically the game is great. Graphics are great. Servers connectivety is a bit spotty but playable.  Its the cheaters that are the majority of the players ruin this game online. Totally unplayable.  I cannot thumb down this game hard enough for this critical factor.

"I don't even really do the story, I just like killing people and blowing stuff up. Truly fantastic in that sense."
"Its GTA V, its a classic."

Classic. Will definitely go down as a game I grew up with.
very fun endless amount of things to do
I bought this movie after my overhearing my grandchildren speak of it as they played in the garden. I bought a copy of it and after putting it in the DVD player it would not play the movie.
Hehe gun shooty and run over friends.

"This game is super good, but when im playing with my friends they like bug my car when they wanna sit in :/"
Everyone knows its the best car game looking forward for the 6
One of the best games ever made.

7 hours in and ive spent at least 6 just driving fun game though
hi guys
"Sure you can rob a bank, drive a tank, but why on earth can't I kill Frank? Whole game stank."
"fun game id recommend playing with friends if you have them  the game has some activities to do but it pretty limited late game  after playing for a while and you've gotten most of everything the game just feels repetitive and bland but it takes quite some time to get to that point, most of the game is just grinding for cash so you'll probably be repeating the same jobs or missions over and over   also the anti cheat on this game is pretty much non-existent so expect cheaters and/or easily accessible cheats"
Worthwhile
bunger
Top tier game way above its league. TRULY AN AMAZING EXPERIANCE
Rockstar support is awful
sh00t pppl
account got hacked. cant even make a new account and play because my steam account is linked to the one that got hacked. Really crappy security.
"The game is a masterpiece but I quit playing because of the hackers and modders, they just ruin the expirience end rockstar dont give a F.U.Ck about it."
Just be sure you log into the correct Social Club Account on first time login. Its a pain getting your steam account disconnected from it.
Just give us GTA VI already
someone its so laggy it freezes every 2 seconds
Chat is this real?

"Online is unplayable due to modders. Has been for years, rockstar doesn’t care. Releasing new content while the game is full of modders and unplayable is baffeling."
"This fucking game has been out for years, make new one damnit"

"Too many griefers to enjoy the online game. Real sadists on here. Waste of nearly 500 hours of my life. Everything else about the game is good like the basic mechanics and the campaign, but everyone online is just the worst possible person and the devs seem to enable them with every update. Also hackers are everywhere and they can ruin your game/day much more easily without any consequence. Do NOT buy this game."
i stole some mans car and i saw a picture of his dead wife and kids thank you rockstar games
loves it purrrrrrrrrr
I got hooked on GTA Onljne the moment I started playing it. No other game has caught my interest since.
How do I buy a new gun??
this game sucks and was the most aggravating experience ever dont buy this garbage  jk its fun game w friends
it was kinda fun ngl
is ok ig
if modders we'rent there it would be better
Good but greedy
Oppressor MK2. Couldn't be a better name for it.
"theres a single player experience taped to a multiplayer ""main"" experience"
after playing fore 200h you can get bored when playing with strangers after getting good cars and being annoyed by oppressors I only still play to do stunts with friends
One day Social Club just stopped working on my PC and Steam Deck. Reinstall didn't help and there is no way to go to previous version + With R* stance on modding they can go to hell.
i did it finally for the past years on my epic account and then buying the game yesterday on steam i fucking got it
really fun with singleplayer mods (game runs smooth only if you have a bulky pc)

I hate myself
cooooool game yo

Its pretty fun in storymode and gta online remember ppl if u are new try out story mode 1st and if u complete dax missions and ur bored in gta online try the acid drugs
Fix ur stupid game
I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who wants to play online. The modders make the game unplayable. Even the ones who give you money are limited to not very much and then you get disconnected anyways. It's chaos with people from around the world and makes the came pointless.
W GTA IS GOATED
great even in 2023
Grind forces players to buy their sharkcards if they want to make any progress. Game is filled with cheaters. Rockstar CEOS are greedy and disgusting humans. Refuse to play this anymore.
Good game if u have time to play
hella amazing
its a good game just a few to many modders

My friend who I play gta 5 with said if I post a review and it gets 150 likes and 125 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka. So im just gonna leave this here.
"Long story short, It's great!!!"
i like apples
Dont get insulted by the profanity in this game <3
Pretty much fun in this game. U have a lot of things to do in online game <3 ez time pass
awsm to play
this stupid Dev. support hacker. Fuck you
"I literally cant even *launch* the game because I have to login to a Rockstar Social Club account. It says I already have a account linked to my steam even though I have *never* played it on steam on a pc, only xbox360. Its trying to make me login into a account with a email address I don't even recognize. I can't even submit a disconnect request because I have none of the account info needed to unlink it. I'd love to actually play GTA again but looks like I just have to play it on 360."
its super fun but not alot of updates and a bunch of hackers
"Base game works fine, but multiplayer gives me the most grief. It used to work, but now it don't. Cannot download ""Online Files"". I suppose that doesn't matter since I no longer have online friends to justify an experience filled with trolls, hackers, and try-hards.  General Complaints: Characters run slow like molasses compared to protagonist of GTA SA. Turning is sluggish (sacrificing satisfying locomotion in favor of smooth transition between animations or ""realism"").  Dying is easier and armor wears off quicker.  Kifflom, kerfblom, kerfuffle, mushroom truffle, sideways shuffle, kerblam! Interested in this game I no longer am. Already beat most of it on Xbox 360, not doing it again."

IT NICE
THIS GTA 5 IS VERY GOOD GAME AND WE CAN PLAY ONLINE PAOURS
This is the best game i have ever played..... All time fav❤️
cant load ..

"Decided to try online version once. Literally 30 seconds in, as I was shopping in a clothing store, someone somehow managed to place trucks against all the doors preventing me from leaving the store. 10/10 online experience."
...........................................................
i shot gun
chicken nugget
I enjoy killing innocent people for fun :)
Nice game but I did not find my friends playing this game as they are playing mobile version which is not connected to PC
This game shit as fuck but good as well just buy it.
haha splatter spree
i love the game but a lot of modders but they are nice
love the graphics
Nice very nice good game but griefers in online should be publicly executed infront of their family
made my balls fart
very good'
Mann Its Fun.
Best game based on story
"I do not play this game correctly and I like it that way.  Never done a single heist or quest or whatever they are, and I don't play single player either, I just fuck around on multiplayer and it's a great time.  Would highly recommend starting a life only to have it tragically ripped away from you. You could also have an emo photo shoot if you want to do that. First time I spun that wheel I won the car so, in theory, I am the better player :)"
alfredo is not good at this game i am better stronger and more smart than him
story mode is only fun when using mods after you finish game tbh
woo
"quite took a long time to connect into the online server. Still, bring me good exp even that from the 10 years old game"
its fun and you can get a good laugh out of your own game play
"Yes, Yes"
I like getting lap dances
it fun and my 10 year old laptop can run it at 30 to 60 fps on an hd graphics 520
"Online mode is so good and interesting in gta 5 , we can buy some really cool garage and store super cars and also special vehicles. I would recommend you to play this game on atleast a 4gb graphics card device with i5 for smooth performance. Based on my experience online mode is better than story mode , especially if you have friends who play Gta online. I personally love using military outfits and supercars , tanks and other miltary and futuristic vehicles in online mode. I think this game will help you gain experience which will later help you when GTA 6 is released  (This game shouldn't be played in presence of parents because of some inappropriate scenes and language)"
pls add workshop for gta 5 offline i rly want to play gta offline mod but i dont want get banned
good n bad at the same time
"Servers are always ""down"""
"Lost access to the third party client login i made 13 years ago, support refuse to help, hoping i would repurchase. Offered a discount and all.   Can no longer play, I have access to my steam and the software purchased through, Just not there shtty little client they force you to login to for no reason at all."
"Hello,  They keep sending my email verification to an unknown email thus, not allowing me to play at GTA5 at all. Then I call the 866-922-8694 Rockstar customer service number and it’s designed for you not to get to someone. Please help!  Regards, Angel 201.344.1891"
Bought it for the single player mods >>>>
good open world really enjoyable especially with friends in online mode.
This game is amazing. I would love to see GTA 6 come out as I'm sure all GTA V players and more would love it. Thanks.
I HATE ONLINE MODE I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT
didn't play it.
crack
EDRERE
very bueno si si recomend
THIS GAME IS MY FUCKING LIFE
hammer to da nutz
i had to hardware reset my pc to play gta and it was worth it:)

uih
Obviously you should play Its GTAV
its very fun i want gta 6 to come out
Cool stuff!
assssssss
haven't had a chance to play it i been waiting for it to load
W game this game is just one of if not the best game if ur looking for a game to play and chill. Btw if u want to play Online try playing in closed servers if u want to grind solo. Anyways definitely recommend buying it. Even better if theres the normal and online version are being sold together on sale!
Crime Go Brrr Gameplay Go Brrr Cars Go Brrr Campaign Go Brrr Guns Go Brrr Radio Go Brrr Playable Characters Go Brrr
"This is a great game, and always has been since i remember. Grand theft auto is a  game to play even when you think there's nothing to do you can always run over peds ofc"
awesome game would defiantly recommend
steal car crash car police kill somone die from police buy property buy car do missons money then have fun
7gf
bet game ever made

A really-really good game! But it can't appear in my streaming room...
wanna cruise with your boys? Don't worry you will be blown up by an opressor within 2 mins of loading in then try kill him and realise he is in fact in god mode.
sex money drug and  billy
Best Game Ever For A Decade Now
Great Game and Runs Smooth
the story mode is the best but stuck on tow truck mission
fun coll
It’s okay
its really boring as i think about it and also gunplay is awful
NOE
IT IS ASS
Yes very much criminal
this game crashes and lags so much it is unbelieveable
Step 1. load game. step 2. invite friend. step 3. kill friend. step 4. repeat step 3 until your friend does no longer want to call you as his friend.  100% recommend
just do
"better than GTA 4 on PC can't compare for the xbox and playstation version. but its sure better than the broken ass PC version. GTA 5 is much more easy to mod and play and overall a better game on PC explains the reason for 60+ hours on this game. and also, fuck you josiah tremone evans"
i like this game i recomend this game :))
yayayaya
i ilke all the game but greifers are the worst things in thai game!!!!!!!
BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!
mid game online sucks juicy balls and i enjoy it. if u know u know and gift me rdr 2 otherwise your gay fr
Hello ! I have played this game almost 90 hours till now. I have enjoyed it most of the time. its really a great game to play.
"just a goated game, online is trash tho"
jjjjj
"I used to love this game, now however it is unplayable online. In every session you will find hackers who have modded their game in some way, which disrupts the whole server and can cause grief to any player playing on it. Other hackers don't even bother modding their game, but instead can tell you your own IP address - best to use a VPN if you do play online.  Mostly though, it's the mod hackers who pull out laser guns and can edit any other player's location, appearance or environment that you got to watch out for. You'll also find that Rockstar are very tolerant of these kinds of players, unfortunately."
"one of the best games i have ever played, would play again but rockstar is getting greedy and money hungry also  lalalalalalallllalalalalalaalalallalaalalal"
hehe. pawn.
Very Grand!
sadadassd
excellent game with superb graphics and excellent storyline

very cool game with lots of nudity
it is good game with a favor price
AWESOME GAME!!!
"Hello and welcome what is hopefully my final attempt at completing GTA 5 without taking any damage. I have a max HP of 1 so any damage from any source will immediately kill me. I also want this to be a no-hit run, so Trevor's special ability is disabled. Because while it prevents you from taking damage, it does not prevent you from being hit by things. I have successfully completed every single mission without taking any damage. I should have yet to do it all in one go. My current personal best for an entire run is one bit of damage and therefore one death. Obviously very close to a perfect run, so I'm hoping this time I'll get an actual perfect run and avoid all damage entirely."
"This Grand Theft Auto online (V) is one of my favorite game. The game has amazing graphics, missions, possibilities and reality open world game. I loved it....! Thanks! Rockstars."
its real
you can shoot american gangstars
"it is a game you can doso much on and not only that u can learn from the game. and it feels like your really in the place that los antos is based of, its a game you have to have the time a patients for but yet its a game money well spent !"
SHOOT ROB STEAL CAR SPEED DRUG FUN

"Otherwise a good game, fun with friends, until you decide to go heisting. You start the heist, retry the heist for an hour, then are about to finish it, one of these things always happen: 1. Someone gets randomly yeeted from the game and the heist fails 2. You retry the heist, you sit in loading screen for 10mins for the heist to fail 3. Someone gets yeeted to singleplayer after completing heist and is left wondering if they got the reward 4. Option 3, but doesn't get a reward and gets to go thru fun time with Rockstar support for getting the reward And oh yea, the cheaters Cheaters won't get banned, but if you might be in the same lobby as the said cheater, you may get banned."

awecome game
uh game gud yes
good but lags a lot between
............
but not open onile
game is good but not Rockstar (by someone account just got hacked)
WHAT A CLASSIC
I use to give it a positive review but clearly Rockstar has abandoned this game to hackers.
"Rockstar account got stolen. No response fro Rockstar Support.  Rockstar account was stolen. First i got locked out of my acc, they are able to unlink my Rockstar acc from my steam then change the email on my Rockstar acc.  Sent a ticket to Rockstar.  No response after almost 4 days now."
too often experiencing servers error. Rockstar is fast if to fix the money glitch but for hand off for the error like this. they only prioritize their own pocket!!!!!!!!
Good Game Rewcomended too
"drugs, gangs, and death is what makes life beautiful :)"
"game is good, would be better if they added a mode where you brutally slaughter british and ginger people"
Michael never got his yacht back :(
i d i g want some money on the game
such a w game
best game ive ever played so much to do and so fun
amazing !
so gay to get money but once you do its a W game
awesome game. worth the money
Because It is good
game very fun i like to kill ppl in it teheheheeheheheheh
"they removed 180 fucking cars from gta online. thats really setting a precedent about how you will own nothing and be happy. ""its because we needed to streamline the purchasing of newer vehicles"" THEN DECLUTTER AND ADD FILTERS/SEARCH TO YOUR FUCKING IN-GAME SITES. DONT MAKE THIS OUR PROBLEM. THE GAME ISNT ANY SMALLER AS A RESULT. ITS YOU BEING TOO FUCKING LAZY TO PROGRAM A GOD DAMN UI FOR BETTER FUNCTIONALITY.  Lets be real here. the game is old. they probably dont know how the fucking code even works for the in-game sites anymore and they fired all the programmers who actually knew what was going on in our benefit but R* said ""BUT THAT COSTS MONNEEEEEYYYY NOOOOOOO"".  Boycotting gta6 suck my dick R*. You banned my friend rightfully so the first time- but then i tried to boost their second account and you ban them- but the hackers!? THE HACKERS NOOOO SIR CANT REALLY TAKE CARE OF THEM. Your money should be spent on FIXING THE HACKER PROBLEM AND THEN RELEASING MORE CONTENT. PEOPLE WILL PLAY WHEN THEY ARENT BOOTED FROM LOBBIES OR DEALING WITH GODMODE GOD-COMPLEX FUCK HEADS. THEYYYY ARE THE REASON THINGS ARE DEVALUED IN THE GAME. NOT CAYO.  As a  great man once said; a heartfelt fuck you to R* and every employee not getting themselves fired speaking up about this shit. go along to get along because you get your fucking paycheck- never mind RUINING the experience or brand paying your fucking check. fuck everything about the world rn."
Inappropriate
This game sexually plesures me
get me too bricked when i play
Rockstar ruined Online with corporate greed.
it has a really good story
mods are fun the story mode is meh
GUVUIHIHBNKNMBOLKIJ
"shit on steam, hackers, no race lobbies. it's all garbage. fine for single player or online mode private session IF a hacker doesn't have your fucking ip or tag or w/e and want to harass you, even online private session isn't safe then so. Just wait for GTA 6 if you're considering buying gta 5 for anything other than like fiveM or single player experience (with mods is possible on single player)"
gand mrwao
"super fun, but most gamers already know that."
Its fun to play alone in the private servers with my friends

hjnuklm
i get erect because of this game
apple sex
itsfun
human sized shit
just buy it already
"greatest game ever. 100 hours worth of main story gameplay and i enjoyed every second. once your done with that, its easy to just run around being a psycho for hours. there is also another 60 or so hours of side missions. and once your done with all that, you can play gta online. its pretty grind-y but very rewarding. the hacker problem is unfortunate though. overall 10/10"
i fucked women
fun but online is pretty buggy
stupid login
"removed almost 200 cars after the mercenaries update, for a totally dumb reason ""too much scrolling in car dealership websites"""
my friend gifted me this game its awesome i would have bought it but he said he bought it for me if i could ask my parents to play it but i dont see any major problems little bugs obvously cuz they dont update the game but gta 6 is being made so i guess its fine
Rockstar Launcher sucks so much balls omg :(
alot of fun
So much fun
"Good but full of cheaters man online ain’t fun anymore, just puts people at risk"
dipshit game
overall good
"It’s GTA, 5 Stars :D get it 😝"
good w9ow
help me please i just got ran over and i needs[p
"The flagship title of ""We won't do anything to maintain this game, but we're going to try to milk every single cent we can out of it."" Every single online lobby has at least one hacker in it. Every. Single. One. Get ready for every 43 year old ""elite gamer"" who's never seen daylight and every 9 year old struggling with the frustration of their parents' divorce to take it out on you in every single lobby you spawn into. You'll be teleported to random places by god moding cheaters who will then proceed to flagellate their micro dicks to killing you over and over again, until you leave that lobby and go find a new hacker to ruin whatever fun you were hoping to have. Go ahead and report them all you want, because in a new feature Rockstar rolled out with this game, they simply won't give a shit! Rockstar will never, *never*, under any circumstances, ban a griefer who is openly modding in an online lobby, but if you should ever find an exploit that allows you to make money quickly without your obligatory tithe to the almighty Shark Card, you can expect your account to be reset and/or banned within the hour.  Money exploits are patched instantly. High payout missions will be immediately nerfed. Any possible chance of having fun in this game will be immediately identified by Rockstar's elite teams and removed before you can actually get the idea that maybe this is a fun game. But the guy who's spawning yachts in the middle of the city and setting you on fire over and over again in combat free zones will never, *never* be banned. That's a Rockstar guarantee."

Nice xd
hehe opressor go brrrrrrrrr
its a good gaem
"Best premium game for fun, entertainment and refreshment in your leisure time."
ma odlicno
"Buggy , infested with modders, you will randomly blow up in 7/10 lobbies, modders can take ur $, kick u mid mission and reset your progress, great game just update it again right? Also rockstar support is bugged wont errors upon submitting tickets. They'll charge you for shark cards tho."
I don't need to explain myself.

"even if you dont play with mods in story mode, this game is great fun. but if you have a mid pc like me then you might want to turn some of your graphics down. beware of modders in ONLINE. modders in story mode = cool but modders in online = horrible ugly people"
"story mode is fun, online is a bit toxic but still pretty good"
ok game
hera hera cum bum
game keeps crashing report this shit to the police praying gta 6 aint this shit
great game mate
i had to hide from my mommy while i went to the strip club
very fun but hard to get into if you dont know anyone who plays
"There are only two things I would have liked to be different:  1) Option to purchase additional safe-houses (Story Mode) 2) Option to change default character vehicle (Story Mode)  Other than that - a definite ""must-have"" for any gamer!"
Only play fiveM actual game is trash
Well it is a good game but people use mods in public server but it is not commen
"This game is unplayable on PC, the online lobbies have a 50% chance of having modders running rampant. Seriously, if you want this game for public lobbies then get it on console instead.  Aside from public lobbies on PC, GTA Online is a fun game, but its milked dry and a monetisation nightmare. If you want anything new and cool you better pay up or sacrifice all of your free time to grind for it."
this is very amazimg
dont go in public you will be shot by everyone
very fun and great scenery. love it
definition of the perfect game
this game old af but still good
Yes this game has been running for 3 weeks even tho i shut my pc off it still runs RIP my CPU 10/10 would buy again
Truly a GTA experience!
pls hailp
i have almost 60 hours in the game and someone hacked my Rockstar account so now I cant log in because of the ROCKSTAR Launcher. whoever designed it so the games you purchase on steam cant be accessed if you dont have a rockstar account should never be able to work in game development ever again. Fuck Rockstar
Great game to chill if it's story mode but if it is online were on a whole different level of disrespect;)
bad game to play alone
ahhh yametee!!!
<====8
"GTA V online has so many cheaters, I'm really tired of it"
YES GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME NO DEBATE
eugh
just play online  the offline is easy af but very good game since it was created in 2013
Story mode very cool
2uy8tu8
Fine until you want to have fun in this game. Why are you able to buy customisable 007 Bond car but not a fighter jet? Ridiculous.
"Franklin, Trevor and Michael are good trio"
"This is an amazing game, I've been playing GTA games since GTA III (GTA 3) and this is just behind GTA:SA in terms of the single player campaign entertainment, but going up to the online, makes this game the best of all franchise so far."
hehe cacca culo spisnelo
Modders ruin it
Крутая игра
steal
the cops hate me
"I cannot believe this game is turning 10 years old.  Even if you dislike open world games, even if you prefer another GTA title over this one, and despite the pit that is GTA Online and the downright disgusting and disrespectful treatment towards fans and modders from Take-Two Interactive, there is no denying just how special Grand Theft Auto V is.  This absolute beast of a game in single player still feels like the most rich, beautiful and entertaining open world game ever made; even after having finished it on all 7th and 8th gen consoles and PC.  From excitedly coming home from school on September 17th 2013 to a freshly collected pre-order for the Xbox 360, to reluctantly buying this game a fifth time on Steam in 2023, every playthrough feels like a fresh experience. Whether it be the order in which I tackle main and side missions, a new detail I never noticed previously, a random event I don't recall or never discovered, switching up my approach to a heist, a radio song making action in the moment more impactful or just finding a new way to make my own fun out in free roam; GTA V is a timeless masterpiece and I think I'll be revisiting even another decade down the line, even if GTA VI tops it.  Bravo, Rockstar Games. Thank you."

I really love the game! This is how I still remember it back in 2017 when I had a PC that could run this on 60Fps. I really wish that you could download Online & Story Mode Separately so that the low end gamers or low storage doesn't have to delete anything I remember this was 37gb or something but worth it!
"Story is good.  Online is OK. Everything's expensive, but if you're into business development, covert heist operations, and drug empire type stuff, the grind can be fun. In public lobbies, expect toxic players and some destructive (most of the time) modders. The upcoming release of GTA 6 is likely going to slow things down development wise. Expect minor bugs, nothing game breaking."
one of the finest
overall
ITS veryyy laging

sasdadasdasd
Despite it's age this game is still viable in 2023. even as a new or old player there is alot of things or businesses to do or discover. although sadly Rockstars inability to listen to the community or their unsatisfied greed this game has had some road blocks. (RIP Red Dead Online) this game is 110% worth it! do the story mode first before online!
Nice !
haha children can be great speed bumps

"I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.  Thank you"
i just kill my friend with the mkII

"GTA V's story mode is an absolute masterpiece of gaming narrative. With its captivating characters, compelling plot, and immersive gameplay, Rockstar Games has created an unforgettable experience. Stepping into the shoes of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, players are taken on a thrilling journey through the crime-ridden world of Los Santos. The seamless switching between the three protagonists and the exhilarating heist missions make the gameplay engaging.  Beyond the main storyline, the game offers a plethora of sidequests and activities, adding to the richness of the experience. The production is top-notch with a stunning open-world environment and graphics that seem to sand strong to this day. GTA V's story mode sets the bar high for gaming narratives and is a must-play for both series fans and newcomers."

"honestly, this game is soo good that it lived for 10 years without getting boring eventhow we should thank all the people that creat us good mods to play so the game still be playable and also the online is sooo good"
One of the most epic games of the latest 30 years. Been playing since 2013 the year that GTAV launched and very hyped for GTA VI
i love to play GTA V.
Gta Online is kinda overrated the story mode is pretty good though if you like shooting people and commiting warcrimes then this game is for you!
jogo legal da pra kse diverti bastante
"As a new player of Grand Theft Auto V, I must admit that I was blown away by the sheer scale and detail of the game. Rockstar Games truly delivered an open-world masterpiece that leaves players immersed in a virtual playground of crime, action, and adventure.  Graphics: 9.5/10 The graphics are stunning, with a vibrant and lifelike portrayal of Los Santos. The city feels alive, and the attention to detail in both urban and countryside environments is impressive.  Gameplay: 9.5/10 The gameplay is diverse and engaging, with a compelling storyline that features three unique protagonists. The open-world design allows for unparalleled freedom, offering a wide range of activities and missions to enjoy. The combat mechanics are solid and satisfying, providing an adrenaline-pumping experience during intense moments.  Multiplayer Experience: 9/10 The seamless transition between single-player and GTA Online mode enhances the social aspect of the game. Co-op missions and competitive activities provide endless fun, though the competitive nature of the GTA Online community might be intimidating for new players.  Character Progression and Customization: 9/10 The character progression system and customization options add depth and personalization to the game. Players can grow and improve their characters, making them uniquely their own within the vast world of Los Santos.  Learning Curve: 8.5/10 The game's immense scale can be overwhelming for newcomers, leading to a slightly steep learning curve. Understanding the controls and mechanics takes time, but the rewarding gameplay makes it worth the effort.  Mature Content: 8/10 GTA V's portrayal of a gritty and realistic world occasionally pushes the boundaries with mature content and themes. While it adds to the game's authenticity, it may not be suitable for all players.  Overall, as a new player of GTA V, I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Los Santos. The game's vast open world, engaging storyline, and plethora of activities kept me entertained for hours on end. Grand Theft Auto V is an iconic title that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest open-world games of all time. Whether you're a fan of action, exploration, or simply want to create chaos in a virtual world, GTA V delivers an experience like no other."

"Lots of issues recently with steam and rockstar. A reddit post about the issues that most of us are having is contacting rockstar support to unlink our steam account, and rockstar not responding.  https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/d0ift3/how_to_see_which_rockstar_account_is_linked_to_my/"
Jobs not working
spend all my time in this game at the strip club tits are a solid 10 but clearly fake and all the same. 6/10
SO GOOD but one part is weird but good
"so fun, not much of a story mode guy but holy hell is this game fun, each heist better than the other"
"good game, installed over 20 mods"
bought this game for my friends who wanted to play with me. got no friends no more lol so ig 7 carrots out of 12 chimichangas
This is the best game
Just know that if you buy this game on steam that your Rockstar Social Account has to be linked to your Steam account and if your RS account gets hacked then you will not be able to ever play any of the RS games you have bought on Steam and there is no Fixing this. RS will not help you out to fix this problem.
I have played like 23%-25% of the story mode and it's VERY FUN and addicting. The characters are super cool and the realistic city/urban type setting is so fascinating. I haven't played much online because it's a little bit boring but I think it will be much more fun once I finish story mode. DEFINITELY would recommend.
This game proves that there is no hope for humanity... And im all for it
entertaining
It's good I guess
GTA V: Good GTA Online: Bad
good but sometimes cant inter online....
Gta story is good. Online is so polluted with modders your better off doing invite only lobbies
oooooooooooooooooooo
ITS AMAZING Exploer the open world gmaing expierions
"I'm gonna quote Todd Howard ""It just doesn't work!"".   Playing this piece of dogsh*t for a long time, you realize how many easy things they've missed the mark on. Quality of life updates are absolutely absent, they make this game so unneedingly tidious. And if you're playing this solo then don't. I dunno what's more depressing, playing online solo or playing LoL. Singleplayer is enjoyable and satisfying but the online experience is straight whack. Don't get me even started on the community, where in every major lobby there's somehow someone with cheats and a modmenu. Every. Single. Time. Updates are getting alot staler with no heists or bigger activities added. K/D is now only affected by 1v1 duels. Ingame inflation is worse than in real life (how the F*ck). They just remove vehicles and content and then drip feed said content to GTA+ subscribers. Expect the grind to get worse year-on-year with smaller and smaller updates. The loading is slow, starting jobs/activities is slow, can't kick any nuisance since there isn't a feature for kicking yet. Man, eff dis shiii- They had to kill Red Dead Online to have GTA Online comatosed."
very great game recommend story mode has lots of missons to do
we all know why we bought the game...

"Grand Theft Auto V is an open-world action game with a variety of different gamemodes. The game features a single-player story and an online world which has received many updates and improvements over the years. Although GTA online has been receiving countless updates, R* still hasn't managed to do anything about a cheater problem. There are many other problems in GTA online besides cheaters including griefers, long loading times and forced co-op work. Many features to ease out solo player have however been added to the game but still at least a one friend is required to unlock and enjoy all the activities the game contains.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] [b]Story[/b]: There are three protagonists ([i]Michael, Franklin and Trevor[/i]) and the story follows their criminal life. Can't say if I enjoyed the story or not since I have yet to finish it.  [b]Missions and Heists ([i]online[/i])[/b]: There are a lot of missions in GTA online some of which can be completed solo while others require 2 or even 4 people. Heists have a couple of setup missions and the whole heist usually takes around an hour to complete. Single missions however take somewhere between 5-20 minutes each. There are nowadays sort of mini-heists introduced in tuners update which have 2 setups and take around 20-40 minutes to complete.  [b]Unbalanced enemies ([i]online[/i])[/b]: The missions and heists have very different enemies especially if we compare and old mission to a new one. A lot of the enemies are quite easy ([i]cops for example[/i]) to defeat but then there are few missions where the enemies just straight up murder you from a mile away. Doomsday heists are a pretty good example of a very difficult enemies. However a civilian with a car is the most dangerous enemy in the entire game. It is just simply impossible to know what they are going to do. They might for example randomly run you down or head on collide with you on a motorway.  [b]Unbalanced payouts ([i]online[/i])[/b]: As mentioned previously there a many mission and heists. Most of the missions have a horrible payout for amount of time they take to complete. Some of the heists are a perfect example of this. Let's take two heists for example which both take around one hour to complete, other pays $500,000 and the other pays $1,500,000. I wonder which one I should play hmm... oh... I forgot to mention that the first heist requires 4 players while they second can be completed solo. There are also shark cards that can be bought to gain some extra money. But the payouts of those ([i]including the slight increase a while ago[/i]) are even more horrible than some of the missions. For example the biggest shark card costs $75 and that will give you $10,000,000 in game which doesn't sound too bad. However when you take a look of what you can actually buy with it is like 3 cars and maybe a shirt. You can just as easily save your $75 and make the $10,000,000 in game in like 5-8 hours while having some fun with the process.  [b]Properties and Vehicles ([i]online[/i])[/b]: There are a lot of vehicles in GTA online some of which you are still able to buy anytime due to recent changes. Most of the vehicles however cannot be bought anymore from the websites but have to either be bought from a dealership or win as a prize when they appear ([i]dealership deals and prizes change once a week[/i]). There are also a lot of properties in the game most of which you have to own to play some of the missions and heists. Pricing of the properties is somewhat balanced but pricing of the vehicles is not. There are for example a lot of over $2,000,000 cars which are absolutely garbage to drive. I seriously recommend new players to watch some guides before buying anything ([i]vehicles mostly[/i]).  [b]Cheaters and Griefers ([i]online[/i])[/b]: GTA online has a lot of cheaters and griefers. Some of the cheaters however are harmless but most are not and they will try to ruin everyone's experience playing the game. I wouldn't recommend anyone to play in a public lobby for this reason. Don't lose faith in the game just because the community is what it is.  [h1]Would I recommend this game?[/h1] - Yes ([i]wouldn't really play over 2000 hours otherwise[/i]). - Definitely worth it if on sale, the game has many problems but still a great game underneath. - Don't, in the love of god, buy shark cards."
f you game by me
makes me want to commit them in real life
Love this game.. it and CS GO will go down as one of the longest played game as in years. I started playing when i was 23 and I'm now 33 and always find something interesting to get into. Cant wait for GTA 6
I've played this for over 100 hours and i have 17 achievments. 10/10
I got this for my brother(he is 19) BIG MISTAKE he kept trying to get on my computer to play and he put a piece of candy on my pc melted as he was playin gta not bc my pc gets really hot no it was because he never touches it for 2 HOURS

"Single player is pretty good, personally not a fan of the multiplayer: hackers, progression takes ages if your not wiling to spend real cash, mini game quality varies and the ones you'l like wont have enough people playing a lot of the time. 7/10"
funni pedestrian go ahh
shark cards are a fkn scam
"started playing this game, lost my friend group, only got one dude who willingly wants to play with me 💀💀"
love war crimes who doesn't
This is one of the best games ive ever played highly recommended
"Just to be clear, I'm leaving this review for GTA Online. I haven't given the story a try, so if you're looking to purchase for the single player, disregard this review.  GTAO is not worth playing anymore, at any price. The content is great, and there aren't any games that really scratch the same itch (including RDRO), but the game is so unstable that I can't recommend anyone try it if they don't already own it. Half of your time is spent actually getting into a lobby, between long load times and straight up crashes/freezes. Once your in, you might also find that content just doesn't work or is difficult to actually access (multiple times I'll load into a lobby to find that I can't launch my Securoserve or Motorcycle Club, for example). And even then, when everything is working, every single lobby is filled with hackers/modders. This is not hyperbole, I legitimately have not played a lobby without someone spamming booming noises trying to get me to buy GTA$ or spawning NPCs to murder me or any other number of griefing hacks.  You can eventually get the game to function and when it does it's fantastic. Like I said before GTAO's content is fantastic and incredibly unique, but to get to the gameplay you have to wade through an ocean of dogshit. If you're considering picking up this game just to play Online, look elsewhere. GTAO is no longer worth your time."
ulp should move in fucking doomsday 2 heist please
i love this game i been playing it since 2021 and i been wating a while to play this on my pc for a while but now i can play gta on my pc now

"...almost 2000 hours in six years. And it's so entertaining, to see other players freak out in public chat (i am rather the calm guy). And GTA makes me so grateful, that we got rigid gun laws in Europe,,,"

Online GTA is a waste of because theirs a hacker in every session and it makes the game unplayable.
GTA Online is more addictive than cocaine
this shit ass as hell
I can't belive that I spent over 800h for this game :v
"i want to cut my pen1s and say this is a bad fuckin online platform with zero safety on people credential, but then again this is gta soo.... thumbs up?, please dont reveal my ip, not if i know it for sure"
such a great game
Highly recommended until GTA 6 releases
very fun not as much people being toxic as there used to be.
"Coming up on 10,000 hours in this game. I can safely say it has taught me programming.  I used GTA:V as a stepping stone over 5 years to teach me a lot of programming concepts, and explore various technologies by building multiplayer experiences through alternative multiplayer frameworks such as alt:V and FiveM.  This game has had a profound effect on my life through third-party multiplayer mods and it took me at hour 9,000 to actually play the single player of this game. I never even bothered with the story because I was so enthralled by writing small game modes using alternative clients.  As a programmer, or someone who wants to become a programmer. Take a look at some the alternative mods because they can teach you a lot. I've since moved on to game development.  This game jump started my professional career as a software engineer."
wow just wow .. this game also must played.. i have waiting to gta 6 ...
its gta V
"I first bought GTA 5 on the ps3, I then got it for PS4 and also have it on ps5.  GTA is a great game and always has been, I think we all know that by now. I have 0 complaints about the steam copy of the game, works fine.   I got it simply to try out fiveM servers, which are not all they are cracked up to be, so if buying for that reason, and already own it elsewhere...no need to get it here.   Otherwise, if you do not already own it already...you should."
"Rockstar let a hacker change my email, without informing me. Now i cant get it back. 450 hours wasted. Support is utterly useless. Thanks Rockstar!!"
ghood g aeme
if you like wanting to die 24-7 then this is the game for you

"nice game , nice graphics and settings"

"Grand Theft Auto V is a realistic game that you can play in third person and first person. We can switch between three different characters: Trevor, Franklin, Michael. It's really great that it's an open world and we can do a lot of different missions. There is a ""star system"" in the game to prevent crime, but you don't have to do missions :D instead, a lot of different races, robberies, conflicts, professions, trade and similar things in the open world You can do . Stamina, stamina, speed, car driving, marksmanship and ""special abilities"" are available."
Modders = Fun

"game is ruined due to hackers, stay away from online"
Must play if u don't U r a Loser
the best first person  game achievements are hard witch is good because we need a challenge and you have online wear its your character and its your world in private
"Gameplay 10/10 graphics 9,9/10 Story 10/10 characters 10/10 endings very sad but 10/10 replayability definently       overall 10/10"
"The game was fun. The email used to make my Steam account and my Cockstar account are different emails, so when the email I used for my Cockstar games account got hacked, I lost the game and still own it on steam. I can no longer launch the game because I'm not signed into the Cockstar games Launcher. Fuck y'all's dumbass, dogshit ass external launcher, what's even the point? You guys haven't done shit since 2018. Now, for me to play this shit ass game, I have to make another account and buy it again. Which I won't do. See you guys in GTA 6"
good but gta 6 is coming next year
loony tunes
I bought this game for $29.99 and this it's not openning.I tried fixing and I reinstalled but it not worked
MY favourite game
its a very lovely game to play and very realistic and enjoyable
How many years until PC gets E&E content?
"While the story is great, everything about the gameplay is terrible.  It's like every AAA title coming out these days, where the passion of a small team is replaced by 1000+ people working a job for a paycheck.  It's contributing to the death of modern gaming and something needs to be done quickly to change it."
"Do not get this game, It fucking remove 180 fucking cars and called it ""DLC"". Rockstar is run by a bunch of retarted monkeys (zoo animals, not racial profiling)"
i love mod menus just to get money
"Well, it's GTA, what more can I say."
makes me wanna commit crimes
"I've never been a fan of GTA. As a kid, I played a few titles like GTA: Vice City and GTA: San Andreas, but they never really held my interest for long. I quickly lost interest, to put it shortly. However, this year (although now I regret not doing it earlier), I decided to give GTA V a chance, and I don't regret it at all. I always used to say that GTA games are senseless, just mindless chaos, car thefts, and being a ruthless serial killer - I mean... I still partly think that, but this time, I set aside my prejudices and fell in love with GTA V. The story, characters, Los Santos, side activities, attention to detail, dialogues, all of it just keeps me hooked! Every hour spent in GTA V brings me a lot of laughter and gives me so much fun. I haven't tried Online yet; for now, I'm having a blast in Story Mode. I've heard that Online mode is for masochists and people with nerves of steel, who have to deal with hackers/modders in their everyday gaming. Maybe someday, I'll join that Online community and see how strong my mental state is. Anyway, I recommend this masterpiece to everyone."
"Story mode means n word 400 times. Epic shooting and mass murder. The prostitutes.. they aint sluts, but they are hoes. shoot the prostitutes to get the money you spent back. Fun game. 10/10 would eat this game."
the sixth one was better.
awesome game but milking it to much
Pretty Solid game it has its weaknesses where the hackers are but other than that its good
fun being terrorist

"Once a brilliant game with slight micro transactions, now a burnt out game with desperate updates and paywalls for cars that were once free. Bring back OpenIV, that's the key to longevity."
"god tier game. if you cant run it, shit game"
pretty awesome
Some guy on a mosquito with homing missiles blows me up. I magically summon my flying delorian with missiles and blow him up. I go to run him over and he pulls out a laser minigun and he opens fire on my windshield and then proceeds to blow up my car with a railgun. 10/10
Its gta. Cool cars. Driving around the city is pretty fun. Gun Shooty. Gameplay loop akin to a mobile game. Fun for a few hours but its a grind. wouldn't recommend without friends
fuck you jimmy

"fun to play single player or online, fun to mod singleplayer, or when you get bored after doing everything everywhere you can online mod (cheat)  and still get some a little bit more fun out of it and to get revenge on modders who troll and annoy you when you play legit"
It's okay
Goodness
Its Ight'
VERy fun

"Their business model should be downright illegal. Removing game content and then pay walling it, who does that?"
"Possibly one of THE most amazing games I have ever played/still playing.  I've been gaming since computers have been in the home (yes I'm old), and this is definitely in my top 5 of games! Along with Assassins Creed Black Flag, Command & Conquer, Age of Empires, Dungeon Keeper & Overlord."
"this is the worst game I've ever played. loading screens make me grow grey hairs, hackers and exploiters everywhere. Would recommend Lester is hot af"

"Was checking out the new and Noteworthy section of the steam store page, click on ""most played"" and GTA ranks #5. Saw the price listed was 67% off at $19.79. clicked on the GTA store page and its regular price with a bundle that's ""25%"" off at $29.98. what kind of false advertising is this. This needs to be fixed, i was hoping to buy this game for a friend."
there is alot of rasists and griefers.pls play at your own risk. i am tipicly calm but this game showed me a whole other side of me
kill.
i like it its a cool game to play with ur friends if u have any

Imagine forcing everyone to link 1 permanent account to ONE EMAIL forever, Like uhh rockstar are you guys too f***in stupid to realize that the average person gets their emails hacked once every 2 years, I haven't had access to that email in over 4 years, And you expect me to just be okay with that. lol what a joke of a company, Hopefully this leads to a class action lawsuit, Can't even access a GAME I PAID FOR!"

Why does Trevor Always Spawn in or near the Strip Club? Bro is 24/7 horny
The npcs in this game are a little wack
very funny
Nerf OPressor MKII >:\
beutiful but still waiting for gta6
there are no male strippers.
this game makes billions of dollars yet there is no anticheat. use that information how you want.
I'm pretty sure I've committed more crimes in GTA V than I have in real life.
mods r fun
story 7/10 gameplay 8/10 online 10/10 sounds 10/10  realitivity 8/10  i recommend this game for you  note: for people who doesnt know there is nudity in the game so its +18 or +21
tiddy and mass genocide. immaculate.
rockstar just can't stop making the BEST GAMES IN THE WORLD
Very good game. I love it!
T4Z4RTERT
Game of the decade.
this game made me mentally insane or i already was idk
good game but i like gta san andreas better
great game that holds up pretty well considering its age
so many hackers
its a game from rockstar ofc itss good
very drippy.
I like when they committed grand theft auto
"Ah, n****, don't hate me cause I'm beatiful, n****. Maybe if you got rid of that old yee-yee ass haircut you got you'd get some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on your ♥♥♥♥. Oh, better yet, maybe Tanisha'll call your dog-ass if she ever stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with that brain surgeon or lawyer she ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with. 🎵N🎵♥🎵G🎵G🎵A🎵"
how cool it is
Great way to get your IP leaked by playing Online 10/10
"While it is a great game its completely ruined by the fact that rockstar has seemingly given up on the battle against hackers and the game is in a complete state of dismay. The only way to enjoy this game is solo or a private lobby, as the hackers have managed to hit new extremes that I have never seen in any other game ever. Hackers were able to start screen recording on my pc, and play audio loops I couldnt stop and it honestly makes me question if this game is even safe to play as it maybe allowing hackers access to my pc. I'd understand a bit more if gta 6 was out but this is still the most relevant title in the series and they are just letting them destroy it."
uytt
this game is great and i recommend you play it
awesome play cant wait to get my controllers
One of the best games ever!!
Nice as always
*Casually helping rockstar not make GTA VI*

"In the world of GTA online, you can either cyberbully, or get cyberbullied. The choice is yours.,"
"This is a legendary game. More precisely, the last part of the legendary Grand Theft Auto series of games, or, briefly, GTA. Although the fifth part of GTA was released to the world a long time ago, it still does not look outdated. This game is still fun and enjoyable to play. And if you don’t play, then just arrange a pogrom on the streets or in the open spaces of a large open world. Even now, the elaboration of the surrounding world is impressive. Even the seabed is detailed. The game has an interesting storyline of three characters that is just fun to play. It's also fun to explore the world. If you are a fan of this series of games, you definitely need to play this game. It's better than reading too many words.  I definitely recommend this game to everyone!"
Its one of the best games.
the customer support is quiet disappointing but the game is fine sometimes gta v online sucks
very racist
U can actually steal vehicles!
one of the best online games f all time and story is pretty damn great compared to the new video games. totally worth it.
it is awsome on fivem

"Quite a nice game. As an approx 10 yrs old game, it's still holding its charm amongst recent AAA titles.  Rockstar games really Rocks when it comes for optimization.  Truly recommended......"
Beating my friends to death is pretty neat
one of the worst experiences you will have after enough playtime. not worth it.
play only if your okay with getting mad over trying to set up a heist and getting stuck because when you exit your hq it fails to load
Account was hacked now I cannot play it and both support teams are a waste. I wasted my money on this game to only be not allowed a refund or be able to even play the game. I do not recommend using anything Rockstar related because it is almost like they can't keep thousands of people from losing their ability to play Rockstar games
very nice 👌
goooooooooooooooooooooooooood
free tits
make the loading faster
"havent played it that much, its pretty fun"

luv the game
"For a 10 year old game, this piece of software looks amazing. Pros: -Great Graphics -Funny Storyline moments -Characters which represent human defects -An abundance of mission to choose from. -Great online experience  -Cons: -Is not as realistic as GTA IV was (even tho V is 5 years newer) -A lot of cars got removed in the last online update.  In conclusion, I recommend this game to everyone. You should buy it and play it because GTA VI isn't coming soon."
modders make me want to slit my wrists 10/10
Yeah. This game is very incredible and awesome. This game is like a dream. Thank you Rockstar
I forgor how fair and funny the Online mode is...
Online there are too many people modding. Modding bullies have an unfair advantage. It's toxic.
Broken game that isn’t rly being focused on since they’re all busy on gta 6
"1 Question , How do you guys make this game???"
BEST GAME I GOT
I love selling drugs          especially after playing this game
Its a really fun game to play and a good game to just mess around in and play with friends in online
this game is really fun would recommend
ytes
sending fat ladies to the moon is the best
good good but alien guns not there not good not good
u can run over prostitutes :thumbs_up:
still one of the most unique games even though it is almost a decade old.
The Oppressor MK2 turned GTA V into a champagne socialist simulator.
pew pew pedestrian simulator
Lspdfr is crazy
there is too much modding and hackers online. they should look into banning all account related to moders and hackers
Why have I spent this much time in this god-forsaken game. I haven't even played the story. It's all from doing absolutely pointless garbage with my friends. It wasn't even that fun. HELP
"game work good, lot of hacker tho"
Very fun to play with mods and mod menus  just make sure the mod menu you are abt to use isnt detected (so you dont get banned online)
glitchy as shit
"Requires Rockstar social club to launch even the single player. Great game, sail the seas."
meh game tbh
steal car :)

I wish you could play steam games on your phone
gg gaming
Just amazing experience even after 10 long years
totally not gonna get my ip pulled or anything. story was fire tho
I can't believe this golf game came with a massive city sized expansion and online mode
Rockstar is losing Linux people because of greed or spite... But they need to remember that there's a lot of people unwilling to buy Windows to play video games.
absolutaly amazing game
WHERE TF IS GTA 6 ? THIS GAME IS OLDER THAN MY LITTLE BROTHER
"I've already beaten gta v on my ps5, and i bought it on pc so i could mod gta and beat it again with a different ending. absolutely amazing story line"
i recommend people play this so they can be real life criminals like me
"Very solid game. Played this on console for a couple of years before deciding to get it on pc (it was on sale) The only issue that I can complain about is that.... YOU DONT MAKE REMOTELY ENOUGH MONEY TO GET ANYTHING IN THE GAME. THIS MAKES IT SO YOU HAVE TO GRIND FOR HOURS TO EVEN GET A DECENT PLACE TO LIVE!!!!!!  In conclusion, it appears that Rockstar wants you to buy their money using irl money. This game may be one of the biggest online scam games in gaming history. #paytowin #broke #cantpaytowincauseimbroke  10/10"
Good game to get high to
ggtsa fuive
The good ending is nice.
"At this point if you really need a review for GTA V if you should get the game, just turn in your PC seriously lol"

jjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
very good verynice indeed would recomend like fighting people and taking their money
"yes, they need to fix where you can use your xbox controller on the game without it randomly making you pause and you cant do anything at all to prevent it. After 10 years and still cant fix that is crazy..."

best game ever made!
"Guys help me out here.   My wife's boyfriend said if I got 100 likes, 10 awards, and a vasectomy, that he would buy my new RTX 4080 setup, and let me back into the house on the weekends.  Please don't let this vasectomy be in vein."

this is the best game you can play where you can  commit crimes and its fun
mid game
"Can't fucking load anything without crashing or sitting idle for 15 minutes, like c'mon cock star, this game is 10 years old, it still takes 5+ minutes to load into online, and every loading zone is a 15+ minute blank screen because the idiots that programmed this game did a half assed job and the game does nothing, literally, there's a video explaining what gta is *trying* to do during those extremely long loading screens, and the guy fixed it in like 5 minutes, but cock star is too full of well... to fix their game, not to mention it's still peer to peer online, so everyone can see everyone else's IP address, because rockstar is too cheap to have dedicated servers for their biggest game. This game is a mess without a mod menu, mostly for protection from all the losers with a god complex on a 10 year old game crashing you, kicking you, greifing you with endless explosions from anywhere in the map, spawning on you to kill you, etc. Now, thanks to rockstar's infinite laziness, pc doesn't get any good updates, everything is for the 15th generation of console this game has been on (and people talk crap about skyrim) and all because cock star refuses to do anything about their security and is hiding behind the console's security to fix their shit game."

"It is absolutely insane the amount of functional issues a game can have as long as this one has been out. They have no problem taking your money for shark cards, but to provide an enjoyable glitch free gaming experience, is something rockstar has yet to figure out. I would not waste money, and probably wont be on GTA 6 either. Huge let down from this game."
this shit has a GUN
its gta what else
Lester took my life savings away 😭
"all good, omg"
"Had a great time playing story mode, played it few times and done it 100%. Wouldnt recommend anyone to play online its a waste of time, nerves and energy. Pure cancer and nobody is doing anything about it. I dont know who is worse game devs or moders but they did a great job of destroying this game. Such a shame this is still one of the most earning games out there."
Amazing been playing this game since I was six
i got private strips a lot because im so sexyyyy
Awesome game. Cool Graphics and amazing storyline.
i mean it has a strip club...

You Can Do Anything Like Having A Shootout With The Cops Or Steal
"This game is the best sandbox crime game if you play singleplayer and use mods, absolute must have for that reason alone. Don't bother with online and stick to the singleplayer so you can really have a lot of fun, my hours speak for themselves and I also played on Xbox One, and PS3."
fly bike go boom steal $
its a great game but i advise people to play story mode before online only because it gets you ready for gun fire driving and its just a great story
its really cool for basketball players to change his mindset

PIECE OF SHIT GAME!!! HOURS TIME WASTED ONLY ON LOADING SCREENS AND RESTARTING THE GAME A THOUSAND TIMES!!!   SUCH A WASTE OF EVERYTHING
loading screen simulator is my favorite game

the game was incredible
super cooooooooool

"I really like the game especially when you can play with friends because its a good time robbing banks with your friends, i think there should be a bit more for you to get 1 million quick and start getting business"
it is fane and can be moded

"One of the most entertaining and detailed masterpieces that's a decade old and still updated to this date. Very impressive and admirable. Great storyline, voice acting and motion capture. Graphics are above average for the time it was created though around average or a tiny bit below average in modern day standards. Just wish NPC drivers reacted to car horns by speaking, moving their cars to the side or pointing a gun at us and shooting, though. Maybe that'll happen in GTA 6. Make it happen, Rockstar.  [h1]Overall Rating: 10/10[/h1]"
amazed by the large open world and storyline
so much fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
grand theft auto iv is better but i like getting my pee pee sucked by hookers so i still like gta 5. 8 dead hookers/ 10
very good game but very many hackers

BEST GAME OF ALL TIME !!
Hist yesh :D
This game is amazing just make sure to only play in private lobbys with friends cause every public lobby me and my friends have joined either had griefers or modders/hackers or whatever you call them
fabulous but sound is not loud.
This bullshit takes 50 yearts to load just for the gta online session to fail and make me reload it again
this game is soooo nostalgic i love it :D 10/10
Allways will stay in my head and ill never stop playing it (unless gta6 drops)
want a bassline 3 8 10 3 5 3 on E string
wonderful game gta v
"Fun game but only buy it on sale and never make a microtransaction. Anybody at Rockstar that put any effort into actually making the game has been paid and is working on something else. Whatever skeleton crew they have left ""supporting"" the game is a joke. No need to give them more money just to sit on their asses and tell you they can't fix anything in the game."
pew pew very fun
Getting Error as unable to login automatically to social club account. and shows an unrecognised account partially. contacting customer support is impossible in steam. and useless in Rockstar games

This is a vary good game to roll play with especially if you are going to be playing it with friends its fairly realistic i love playing it i would put it at a 10/10
Laggy.
very cool game recommended  and cool story
"The online version of the game is full of cheaters and Rockstar do absolutely nothing about it. Makes for a moderately unenjoyable experience for the most part.  On the days there are no cheaters online, it can be a bit of fun."
single player has a decent campaign not the best rockstar has done but not the worse the theme is still in par with the Grand theft auto series as a whole probably one of the better gta games the GTA online is riddled with bugs and problems that rockstar just flat out doesn't fix the game has tons of hackers and modders that break the game and deletes or removes your ability to enjoy the game and there is an endless cash grab trying to get players to ignore the core reason for gtaonline and just buy your self in game money to bypass your lack of skills to gain the money neccessary. that aside the adition of private mission playable area's are a blessing on a broken system though modders can still ruin your day by blowing you up and harrasing you it is a mass action not a targeted harassment. you just log out and not play for a few days and they may have gotten bored and left.

I LIKE THE GAME MOST
best game ive played if your looking for action this is the game
"They nerfed cayo perico again, which to me was the only viable and fun money making method in this game to do with friends. I was pondering coming back to this game and grind out the new cool Jet, but this was the last straw, Rockstar has to Rockstar itself all over gtaV until the last cent has been made, and until the last player has left."

"Played GTA online for about 3 or 4 hours. Some hacker put some device on my character like a jetpack and my character would fly out-of-control and die non-stop, even after reviving. Online = 10/10 (for the hackers)  Although the singleplayer story mode is kinda cool.   But Rockstar have a multiplayer mode that only works for hackers.  Will you play story mode? Go for it, buy the game.  Will you buy to play multiplayer? Don't buy it.  Edit: A friend told me how to create private sessions in the online mode. For this reason I recommend the game now."

Arguably the most revolutionary game to ever be released. Very fun game both online and story mode. 100% recommend. Also very affordable
"Do you like Grand Theft Auto V? I've been a big Rockstar Games fan ever since the release of their 2001 masterpiece, Grand Theft Auto III. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too quirky for my taste. But when GTA III came out in '01, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.  The whole game has a clear, crisp graphics, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the gameplay a big boost. It's been compared to Saints Row, but I think GTA has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.  In 2013, Rockstar Games released this; Grand Theft Auto V, their most accomplished game yet. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Three Leaf Clover"", a mission where your character robs a bank. The mission is extremely intense and by the time it ends, it has an emotional resonance that's very hard to shake. It's a perfect encapsulation of the narrative strength of the game, something Rockstar has perfected. It's about breaking the law, but on a deeper level, it's a devastating critique of the capitalist machinery that drives our society.  The game's graphics, especially in the Los Santos city, are so bright and incredibly detailed that they really highlight the game's underlying message of the falseness of the American Dream. This isn't just a great action-adventure game, it's a great sociopolitical statement.  But I also think Grand Theft Auto V works because of its three-dimensional characters. Michael, a retired bank robber, is a vivid portrayal of a man struggling with the emptiness of success. Franklin, a young hustler, showcases the struggles of someone trying to escape the harsh realities of urban life. And Trevor, the game's most anarchic figure, provides a chilling glimpse into the psyche of a true sociopath. It's this trifecta of perspectives that makes the game a standout in the gaming industry.  The online multiplayer mode is fun, a great way to blow off steam, and also quite addicting. It adds to the replayability of the game, making it more than worth its price.  You can tell that Rockstar Games was really firing on all cylinders here, because the game's breadth and depth are almost staggering. Every mission feels meticulously crafted, every character brims with life, every satirical jab hits its mark. In terms of sheer scope and ambition, there's really nothing else quite like it.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V's immersive narrative, top-notch gameplay mechanics, and cutting satirical humor make it not just a standout title in the Grand Theft Auto series, but also a high watermark in the history of video gaming. It's only in the context of this complete artistic statement that the brilliance of the game truly shines through."
great game so much to do and very fun to play with friends totally recommend
story mode is amazing cant wait got GTA 6
very lanja game chi chi
Bro Hackers somethimes are nice thats relly nice they make game pretty fun but then there are no fun ones that ruin the game so any chanse rockstar fix it
THIS GAME IS VERY NICE I LOVE GTA V
RY FOOGOGOV
Well rounded game to mess around with friends and have fun doing quest(missions) that are challenging and fun! The only problem I've had is running into a lot of modders(people with exploits/gta hacks)
you should focus more about mods no gta 6

"Disgusting pay to play, removal of content for the sake of adding it to a monthly subscription. GTA 6 is going to be made with monetisation no doubt in my mind. 3/10 with friends due to grind, otherwise 1/10"
"Classic GTA, what's not to love?"
very goos

love the game especialy when i have one star because i have my character color black
GTA online is absolute garbage. No hope for new players in presence of all those toxic idiots with modded stuff and lot of money

It is just a good game! buy it!!!
"This game is very fun to play with friends or alone, there are so many things to do. But money is hard to get, you always need to do preps for heists and that takes like 1 to 2 hours + you do it with friends cause alone it's almost impossible. and then you get like 25 percent of the money, and that's like 600 thousand!  But like this if you are also banned cause you used cheat engine ;)"
gta role play
fucking dlc wont work fuck you and everybody ells shit game rilly ass

Very good Very very very good this game I recommend in the top of the rank I play this game whole day when I buy a new laptop but I now also like this game After one year of playing GTA5 but no boring
"Just finished loading into the game, took a while"
Good game for steam deck.

"Yes, I would recommend GTA V to other players. It is a highly popular open-world action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North. The game offers a vast and detailed open-world environment set in a fictional version of Los Angeles and its surroundings. Players can experience an engaging storyline with three main protagonists, each with their own unique personality and background. The narrative combines action, drama, and humor, providing an immersive gaming experience."
cool game taught me how to drive inrl and now i teach my kids on gta than on the road 10/10
"Constant crashing online, disconnects, and hackers ruining it. Console version is better"
seruuuu
"Certainly between the toppest games to have. Though there's a good handful of abusive modders online and the game isn't as maintained as it used to, it is still a banger."
"Even 8 years later, this game is easily one of the best that you can buy."
i hate tryhard players

i like the game so much but so much bad things in game
"y'know sometimes I don't know what i'm doing with my life, this may be one of those times. I have just purchased gta 5 premium edition or whatever after purchasing gta 5 on my Xbox 360 and Xbox one several years ago. Why have I done this? i'm not sure, I must be so bored that I decided to throw even more money away to rockstar than what I already have. Fantastic game by the way."
AH YUP

SILLY POOPOO GAME
"this game is a waste of time..i'm 155r hrs in..i shouldn't have to go to a game wiki to try to find where i need to got next..dont buy/quit this foolishness, and go play a truly great game, like red dead redemption"

"I just go to the strip club for the tits in my face ! they are nice , i love the drugs and money and prostitute near the beach ."
fantastic cranking 90s in these innocent civilians is almost as fun as dropping a M.O.A.B. and drone striking innocent civilians in iraq on god
"Honestly, unless you are willing to put an extra $20 (MINIMUM) into a decent mod menu, this game is not worth it. The state of PC GTA in 2023 is pretty rough, with roughly half of every lobby having cheats in some capacity (not hyperbole, genuinely at least 50% of every public lobby you get into).  If you are really dead-set on riding the 2013 nostalgia train, I do encourage you to look up ""Stand Free"". Stand Menu offers the ""Protections"" portion of their mod menu to everyone completely for free. This, at the very least, will stop most Griefing, Kicking, or Crashing methods, and it will make your GTAO experience in 2023 at least tolerable."
"kill random grieffer, he is a moder, try his best to destroy my game, makes me crash. 10/10 story mod good too  ( gta online is not an online gta 5 experience its more like some WW3 game )"
Hadn't played in awhile and due to my own failed research I couldn't not transfer from my PS4 account to PC making my purchase useless and unfortunately don''t feel like grinding my life away again trying to make up for it.
Strip club boobies is good
"it's cool, second place to San Andreas and definitely one of the best experiences you can get from a video game."
great grameeee
it was amazing and my childhood
good because car funny :)

4184185471
I love hitting old grandmas
this game sucks but i cant stop playing
the game is gta v for christ's sake
its a good game with a amazing story mode but gta online is a grind and since rockstar kinda has their head up their hole they cant come out with good updates. overpricing everything for crying out loud a beat up van with some guns on it is 1 million like WHAT! but if you like the satisfaction of completing heists or buying that one car or garage you wanted then gta online is just for you also be patient because rockstar made waiting times inhumane.
vroom vroom oh no crash find new car
"This game is the best ive played so far, its fun and wide"
i shot a bitch in the head just cuz i wanted to
BOOBS ARE NICE
5serdyutfgiop0[-]=

Davey!
Its a good game haven't played online yet though
"Steal car. Kill police and anyone else in the way.  Online is great for creating and showing off cars for example, I've been making all the cars from the fast and the furious franchise.  Offline mode consists of a great story line (as Rokstar are known for). Hacking is the only issue in online mode, almost all the public lobbies have hackers, I just make ""friend only"" sessions. Price is decent for what you get however, the game can be grindy at times in online mode the best thing to do is forget about the money and have fun and before you know it you've got millions. Highly recommend!!"

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) is an absolute masterpiece that has taken the gaming world by storm. Developed by Rockstar Games, this action-packed open-world adventure has set a new standard for gaming excellence. From jaw-dropping graphics to a captivating storyline, unforgettable characters, and a vast, never-ending world, GTA 5 offers an unparalleled gaming experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end.  Visually stunning, GTA 5 boasts some of the most breathtaking graphics ever seen in a video game. The attention to detail in the sprawling landscapes of Los Santos and Blaine County is simply awe-inspiring. From bustling cityscapes to serene countryside views, the game's graphics immerse you in a living, breathing world that feels incredibly realistic. Character models are meticulously crafted, and every aspect of the environment is richly textured. The seamless transition between day and night cycles and dynamic weather effects further enhance the game's visual appeal. Prepare to be blown away by the beauty and realism of GTA 5's graphics. The storyline of GTA 5 is an epic rollercoaster ride that takes players on a thrilling journey through the lives of three distinct protagonists: Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. Each character is skillfully developed, with their own unique personality, motivations, and background, making them relatable and compelling. The narrative weaves a gripping tale of crime, redemption, and the pursuit of the American dream. As you delve deeper into the characters' lives, you'll find yourself emotionally invested in their struggles and triumphs. The non-linear storytelling approach allows players to experience the story from multiple perspectives, adding a layer of depth that is rarely seen in games. The heart and soul of GTA 5 lies in its diverse and unforgettable cast of characters. Michael, the retired criminal seeking to reconcile with his troubled past; Franklin, the ambitious street-smart hustler; and Trevor, the unhinged and unpredictable force of chaos, come together to create a perfect blend of chemistry and conflict. Their interactions and relationships are incredibly well-written, and the voice acting is top-notch, bringing the characters to life in a way that feels natural and authentic. Whether you love them or loathe them, the characters in GTA 5 leave a lasting impression that will stay with you long after you've completed the game. One of the most impressive aspects of GTA 5 is the seemingly endless amount of content and activities it offers. Beyond the main storyline, the game is teeming with side missions, random encounters, and a myriad of recreational options. From adrenaline-pumping heists to leisurely rounds of golf or tennis, there's always something to do in Los Santos. The online multiplayer mode, GTA Online, takes the experience to a whole new level, allowing players to team up with friends and explore the vast open world together. The constant updates and additions to GTA Online ensure that the game remains fresh and exciting, even after years of play. Grand Theft Auto V is more than just a game; it's an interactive masterpiece that sets the benchmark for open-world gaming. With stunning graphics, a gripping storyline, memorable characters, and a never-ending supply of activities, GTA 5 provides an unparalleled gaming experience. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the world of video games, GTA 5 is an absolute must-play. Prepare to be captivated by its charm, immersed in its world, and thoroughly entertained by its endless possibilities. Step into the shoes of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, and embark on a journey that will leave you breathless and begging for more. Grand Theft Auto V is nothing short of a gaming marvel, and it will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the greatest video games of all time."
100% should get it i got addicted very fast
i like ramming my car into civilians!! 10/10 very realistic
real life if it was good
GTA Online is a wild hellscape that encourages griefing and domestic terrorism i am sick of the npc cars trying to swerve into you for no reason and the unrealistic time limits for selling goods from your personal businesses that require you to have a mate get on to help you other wise you lose half your sell value I am just so fucking sick of practically being asked to hand my wallet over every time i log into the game
played for 331 hours all i did is grind never buy this game
"Guns go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, cops go splat"
realy good game
"I alleady have exactly 1998.79 hours in this game on console. I love everything about this game. the story, the caracters, the open wrold just everything. im sad to see that rockstar dosent give a shit about online safety tho."
cgj8ytpt7odicgtupiyfxjug yes
"Such a complete game. A masterpiece. I've already played the story mode multiple times before, so I only play the Online mode. I will say that to play this game smoothly, you need a pretty good computer, which I can't say I have."
god damn this game isnt even fun but its so addictive
BLS
its a good game but flying the helicopter is genuinely the worst experience ive ever had in a game
"Super good game, Can't wait for GTA 6"
4yy5
pouyi
Great for modding
"Awesome game, been playing for years"
nevermind
fun even in 2023
why is it so fucking hard to just play the game????? join 100 heists. 90 ends up being weird internet issue and I end up falling to my death??????? the few precious couple connected ones teammates always just rage quit or die. bro. such a brilliant game but why is it so fucking hard to just play the game>??>???????>>>???
This Is a very good game personally for me because of lspdfr mods but i do have to stress to you don't use a dell optiplex because it uses self integrated graphics and I honestly think dell is horrible
chill af
great game came across a few hackers tho
gta i a great game
Best game seriously!
"I'll have two number 9s, a number 9 large, a number 6 with extra dip, a number 7, two number 45s, one with cheese, and a large soda."
violence = good :)
it cool nothing else u have to say
kill hokers gud
its gta cant go wrong
trying to get 1000 hours in gta day 4
cant even open the game without it just crashing
play for 100 hours and get a lobotomy when the game gets boring. cheaper than shark cards
its a good game but remember that rockstar doesnt care about the pc version and theres too many modders
step 1: ask your mom to come look at something  step 2: show her the cool shoe store
"Great game. Very competitive players. The vehicle community on the game is also great. Other than there being hackers still roaming extensively on the game still to this day, it is not a bad experience."
"They really are just milking a corpse that somehow still manages to get money from people, this game really went downhill ever since they added the Opressor MK 2 and sci-fi broken stuff"
"Very good game, I love GTA serial. Best GTA games,"
"Absolute cancer online. Modders and cheaters everywhere. Full of 12-13 year old kids who ruin your experience.  Edit: Even today, every single session is modders cheating, exploding and causing havoc online. Rockstar doing absolutely nothing about it. Such a shame, the game has potential to be amazing but its riddled with cancerous little modders."
"Favorite game of all time sad to see it go out but glad to see 6 in all it's glory. (soon) I would genuinely recommend this to any gamer, best story I've ever played and love the 3 main characters.  : c"
JUST USE SHIFT AND DONT SAY WALLS EZZZZZZ
Except the grind for money and oppresor mk2 griefer its a 10/10.
"Is game, much fun."
a fu**ing masterpiece!
yes very game
got banned tho
de realism of the game
Thumbs down for the Rockstar Games launcher. I now need 2 accounts to play 1 game.
i take back everything you can play ball with chop and take on walk very good game chop is amazing
it has a really good story and its really good
Storyline is very strong. But controlling cars is a bit difficult.
"fun, guns, gardening hoes, money, cars"
"Y'all, I recommend to buy this game when its on sale, especially with the bundles that contain a shark card (depends on how much $$ u have). The storyline is very good, every mission is made/programmed with detail, you can experience some bugs but like, this game is a decade old, but everything's fine. The city is very beautiful, almost a perfect replica of Los Angeles, aswell is North Yankton but u cannot visit it, its just a part of 2 missions. Overall I like this game very much and you can def buy it, again, on sale its much better"
good GAME
yes 10/10
I literally still don't know how to drive
modern rdr2  8.7/10
"After hours in this game, i can assure you that it is only worth your time if you are a cheater or want to play the singe player story mode. Ignoring the constant game breaking bugs and rampant server issues, this game can be fun. However, there are cheaters and modders everywhere who constantly harass you and prevent you from playing the game while you cant do anything about it except leave the game. Cheats include invincibility, teleportation, killing every player in their vicinity or every player in the lobby, kicking everyone from the lobby, transporting everyone in the lobby to a location or specific players to locations, changing it so that it looks like they didn't kill everyone, etc. This doesn't mention how cheaters can openly talk about cheating in chat or how bots will destroy your eardrums by announcing cheats and money for sale to the entire lobby. This especially matters in a game based upon money where cheating can ruin hours of hard work and patience. Until rockstar cares about the player, this game will remain unplayable."

"I'm gonna be honest here, GTA V is an amazing game that I skipped out on for years, and after playing it, I can guarantee that the singleplayer story was fun, and messing around offline was also fun, the game's pretty good in that regard.  However, I bought the game in the hopes of playing the Online mode with friends, and ran into a brick wall.  Rockstar requires you to use its Social Club to log into Online mode, and while I hate the use of a separate launcher and service when I already have Steam, I just ignored it and kept going.  That wouldn't be a problem if I could actually log into Online mode, because whenever I tried, it'd display ""Social Club is offline - Sorry, Rockstar Game Services are unavailable...""  This wasn't during any downtime in the servers I know of, mind you, this was over the course of several days, and as far as I see, it is an issue that hits a good few people.  I tried every suggestion I could find to fix the issue - restarting my computer, a clean reinstall of the Rockstar Launcher, a clean reinstall of GTA V, fiddling with my firewall settings, tinkering with the DNS settings, and even what Rockstar suggests, and nothing worked.  I could log into the launcher and play singleplayer, but I couldn't even log in in-game.  As far as I can see, the game is just fucked - sure, I can replay the story, but I bought this to play with friends, not to play alone.  In short, buy this at your discretion - it's a fun game, but if you run into the same issue I have, good luck getting past it.  I know some of these fixes work for a few people, but in most cases, I'd wager those're flukes."

"A Crime-Fueled Open-World Masterpiece  Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  This exceptional work of art is the epitome of open-world gaming, seamlessly blending an immersive narrative with a vast sandbox world ripe for exploration. Rockstar Games has crafted a crime-filled masterpiece that continues to captivate players with its compelling characters, dynamic gameplay, and an ever-evolving online experience.  A Triple Protagonist Experience: GTA V introduces a unique storytelling approach, allowing players to step into the shoes of three diverse protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. Each character has their own distinct personality, motives, and story arcs, intertwining in a thrilling tale of crime, loyalty, and betrayal.  A Living and Breathing Los Santos: The fictional city of Los Santos is the star of the show, boasting an incredibly detailed open-world that feels alive at every turn. From bustling city streets to serene rural areas, the world is teeming with life, and every nook and cranny is filled with something to do or discover.  Dynamic Heists and Action: GTA V's heists are a highlight, offering exhilarating missions that require precise planning, teamwork, and daring execution. Whether you're robbing banks or hijacking armored trucks, the high-stakes action keeps you on the edge of your seat, feeling like the mastermind of a crime syndicate.  A Playground of Mayhem: GTA V is all about freedom, and the game encourages you to embrace your wild side. Engage in high-speed police chases, cause chaos with explosive weaponry, or simply take in the sights from the skies with stolen helicopters. The sandbox environment invites you to unleash your creativity and take on the city as you see fit.  Endless Online Adventures: Beyond the single-player experience, GTA Online offers an expansive multiplayer world where you can join friends or meet new players. Participate in a wide array of activities, from competitive races and deathmatches to cooperative missions and heists. The ever-expanding content ensures that there's always something new to enjoy.  Immersive Side Activities: In addition to the main story and online adventures, GTA V features an array of engaging side activities. Play a round of golf, engage in a game of tennis, or try your luck at the casino. These diversions add depth to the world and provide a refreshing break from the criminal underworld.  Visual Splendor and Attention to Detail: The game's graphics are nothing short of extraordinary, showcasing an attention to detail that brings the world of Los Santos to life. Whether it's the vibrant cityscape or the beautiful natural landscapes, GTA V's visual splendor is a testament to Rockstar's commitment to excellence.  Final Verdict: Grand Theft Auto V is an unparalleled open-world experience that has stood the test of time. Its gripping narrative, dynamic gameplay, and ever-evolving online component make it an essential addition to any gamer's library. Embrace the criminal underworld of Los Santos, and immerse yourself in a world of crime, action, and endless adventure in this groundbreaking masterpiece from Rockstar Games."
"not worth playing in 2023. Unless you do inv only sessions with your friends you will be met with cheaters every session, every race, every heist. It just isnt fun anymore."
waitimg for gta 6
its still really good
"GTA online full of hacker nowadays, glitches, not to mention bugs that still around like 4 -5 years and they never fix it. stuck in the loading screen. keep milking the game rockstar"
Игра топ!
Classic.  Online is a gank fest but private instances make it a giant single player experience.  Lookin forward to GTA 6.
*_*
HAHA CGE NALNG
"This game is very interesting , You get a open world where you can do anything whatever you want and may more. I will definitely recommend this game for you ."
"The only reason i bought this was to play it with mods as I've already bought and played this game 3 times at least. However, the modding scene is in one of the worst state I've ever seen in a community. Modding the game is tedious and most of the mods are paywalled using patreon. Its funny these entitled modders think they deserve compensation for manipulating another companies assets, using software developed by said company to hold their hand through the process. Its literally the easiest job in gaming developement and you dont deserve a penny. Also, charging money for mods is breaking TOS and Illegal. I will be reporting your mods and patreons to Rockstar so good luck!"
YAP GG
game makes me want to commit homicide of a children's hospital
the best game even when gta v six comes out pepare its gonna be nice
THIS GAME IS  SO GOOD TO PLAY

"The Police AI kinda sucks because they don't try to arrest you or anything like that, they tell you to pull over then they shoot you, make them arrest you but you could just pay to leave or something"
rly good story and fun heists
I love this video game. It's been out for years and I still enjoy it like it just came out yesterday. My only issue was the lag my computer experienced due to it taking up so much space on my laptop. Everything else about it is perfectly fine.
great single player online is so money hungry it might of destroyed rockstar play this game for the single player dont play it for the online
wooo
"Idk dude, it's GTA 5"

1 of best game in all of games in this planet  !
sometime while playing gta 5 game showing screen issue. how we can resolve this issue.
Do not play the online and then it's good
very fun to play with friends
Honestly a good game but the Social Club and online are so useless when Steam exists. Why do I need another online service for a game that's amazing offline but just turns into random nonsense that begs for more money to ruin everything. Certainly worth full price even as GTA6 is coming up but there's no reason to spend more money just to play with the bloat that is GTA Online. At least it has an online while Red Dead is only good until you beat the game once. Point is I've had more frustrations than I ever needed because of things that are not the single player.
"online is so fun i love getting raped by an 8 year old on their brothers computer flying a jet bike that somehow has missiles, 10/10"
ALLWAY STUCK IN LOODING SCREEN
Fun game cant wait for gta6!
the online is trash

Cant even fix own game bruh
gta online is best game
"GTAV through Steam is actualy my second purchase of GTA 5.  I lost my first complete GTA 5 install due to malicious modders. I lost more than two hundred dollars worth of shark card purchases, many, many millions in gta money , real estate, autos, and planes. Over ten years worth of gaming hours and accumulated assets an RP were lost when a modder stole my on-line identity and Rockstar has failed to recover it for me. If you buy GTA for the PC you can expect relentless harassment by modders who can do to you what they did to me and Rockstar can not do a thing to stop them. If you do buy the game, you can also google and check out the Kiddions mod menu. It is a free menu system that allows you to spawn most of the vehicles in the game for use in the current session.  It is a fun game to play on those rare occasions when there are no modders and no one trying to sell you menus to further ruin your enjoyment. Just dont invest more your hard earned money on the game than you want to potentialy lose in an instant."
bang kalo main roll play kaya mana dah
"I own this game on 4 accounts and I've replayed the story multiple times, the story is clenching and sucks you into the game and each character. Not only is the story good but the online version is even better with a never scene before experience"
This game old asf when 6 coming out plus online is ass.
Car is fast Flying Bike is Faster
"GTA never fails to please,  One of my favourite games of all time. I've played this game on all, Xbox, PC, and Xbox 360 as well.   GTA Online is 10x funner with friends so if you have a friend who enjoys playing shooters such as: Payday 2, Call of Duty, etc. Then they're bound to love this one!  Even with or without friends it is still fun.  I think my only complaint would be the fact that most of my friends who do play GTA, play on Xbox so because I have a GTA 5 Xbox account, I hate having to always switch between accounts. And, I wish Rockstar implemented the feature of account linking, but hopefully they do that when GTA 6 releases.   But until then, enjoy having a blast with GTA 5!"
The Sex Update is real
"I cannot get into the game because my brother created the Rockstar club account when he was young, and he forgot it. I can't even make a new one because the one you make is permanent."
"I  am  getting hacked on the middle of mission and cant carry on. Forced to shut down game. This is sucks. 278 hours update. In order to get rid off hackers abusers you must play in ""Invite only mode"" Game is much more pleasant but still, freezing and stopping right on the middle of delivery and you loosing money being collected all day. Also game makes you repeat lots of stupid stuff like ""Resources""  and it completely takes fun out. Developers are taking shortcuts by running you around map for nothing."
i can do anything in this game and that makes it fun
fun with friends and das bout it
super fun game uwu
moddersssssssssss
Game made me scared of LSD.
forgot my old email address and now will never be able to play again
"any game with guns, sex, and relationship problems is amazing"

"Do not support Rockstar Games, they fail to provide support to paying customers.  Because of Rockstar Social Account issues I was unable to access the game or game content."
10/10 game i  love running people ovver when my mommy and daddy fight
It's like RDR2 but set in 2013 and with better online content.
Great game. Especially if your planing to use fivem
shoot women
"Stole a car, robbed a bank, killed some pedestrians, and went back to my safe-house to play some GTA 5. 10/10 would play again when my prison sentence is up."
"so fun steal, shoot, beat people up!!!! love it!! 10/10 game!"

GTA 5 the game about grand theft auto five
"Can't play, keeps asking for activation and then says the code I JUST BOUGHT is already in use. F*ck Steam for this. Two times now I've asked for refund."

"It's GTA 5, its good."
its great how many ways there are to make money and be successful like making businesses playing heists drug wars and lots more
Its not as good as GTA 4
Fuck you Rockstar for making it impossible to play a game without your shitty launcher that barely fucking works.
got jerked off by a hooker. based
its a fun games and you can kill people
"Good, good game"
Amazing game through and through
Drive around for 5 hours to complete 2 heist prep because they made it specifically so the mission you get sends you to the opposite side of the map
cant play without cheaters \
"Love the story in storymode. Online is okay, lot's of kids and tryhards tho.."
i punched a woman by accident and she died and i got 30 bucks from it

love the game but get a fucking anti cheat!!!!!!!
"""someone's been playing Grand Theft Auto"""

You can't play the game anymore if you don't remember which email you used for RockstarClub account.
its extremely cool and fun i play it everyday i recommend this to everyone and its coller with mods
LOVE GTA
Fun to play but online can be a bit annoying.
this game gave me brain cancer
"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), a decade after its initial release, continues to stand as one of the best video games ever made. The game offers an unmatched single-player experience with a captivating story-line and an expansive open-world environment that impresses players even today. GTA Online, the multiplayer mode, has evolved with time, providing numerous engaging activities for players to enjoy. While some may have grown tired of the game over the years, its objective greatness remains undeniable. From an outstanding map design to a perfect sandbox setting, GTA V offers endless hours of entertainment. Regardless of when it first released, it would still amaze players and be hailed as an exceptional gaming masterpiece"
"this good af , make more glitch rockstar for us , the good glitch ofc for the diamond or cayo heists"
this game makes me wanna kms so dose every game.... maybe i need help idk tho
amazing game highly suggest you download fivem for roleplaying servers and that you caqn just search up fivem from your browser and its easy from there
"Very Fun, Including the online mods."
meh kinda better than growtopia ig
"If you want to do the same stuff over and over and over again expecting to get something out of it then your looking at the wrong game. Well the first part was right, but the second part no. This game is actual insanity. Boring combat, unsatisfying game-play and the ragdolls are a huge downgrade from gta iv. Have fun grinding hours on end just so you can get a cool new vehicle. Wow what a waste of everyone's time. Worst game ive ever played. I punched my desk until my hand was purple because this game DRIVES ME INSANE BECAUSE HOW REPETIVE AND BORING IT IS."
This game is really fun i downloaded it so i could play lspdfr and five m is is realistic and the best game i have ever downloaded.
I Love the game but when i logged in it did not have my pass and when i made a new account is said use your old account.
amawing game
Mods are insane
This game is pretty much dead online. you cant find a session without a modder anymore. im tempted to mod the game just cause there doesnt seem to be anything being done about it.
gand theft ato five
Rockstar broke this game and essentially stole my money by suddenly blocking me from playing a game I paid for--corporate selfishness abounds.
sucks cock
a nice game
2nd day playing this game and all i can say is:  -Loading screens -Disconnect -Cheaters  They still didn't figure this shit out 10 years after the release?
pretty boring after a while but still a good game
ver cool
shitty game do not buy bored after a while useless game
modders give you free stuff and finish your quests/collectables for you which completely negates the progression of the game
aha
its  the best game only if you are alowed it has amazing graphics and has loads of fun stuff
vedy vedy good game yes yes yes
норм
good but its soooooooooooooooooo laggy
so much great cars was deleted
Very good value for the often discounted asking price for the title. Just stay away from those pesky Shard Cards.
you forget a thousand things everyday. make sure this review isnt one of them
"decided to play in 2023 although as of writing this i have 5 hours, its amazing"
did you pray today
"Whenever you play this game online, there are atleast 2 modders in every server and they ruin the game for everyone. Doesnt matter you report them, they are never getting banned. %95 of the modders are chinese and they cant even speak english the slightest. They just attack people, put them in cages, teleport them to random places, explode them out of nowhere (literally killing every player in the server at the same time), splashing you with water and chain-stunning you until you die etc... When you try to report them, your game crashes. They can even kick your from the servers like an admin. Do you know what rockstar did? They released a special DLC for the new console players like people who own a PS5. Rockstar doesn't care about PC players, literally. These modders have been in the game for 5 years straight. PC players have been complaining about the modders for years and they release a special DLC for PS5 and XBOX Series X/S. They are almost saying ""f you"" to PC players, Im just done. Never buying a rockstar game ever again. Please dont tell me to go invite only server, its pointless to play online when i play solo in a server. Its not my responsibility to get these servers cleaned from cheaters. Rockstar is the greediest game company ever existed. To the people who wants to get the game : just dont. Its a waste of time. You are like the aim training of players who use godmode and they just ruin your game all day. If you want to play single players, its so null and basic. Not worth it."
"This game is painful to play. Everyone is cheating, and its always in a game breaking way. Can't recommend buying anymore"

vari gud
"Only for SP part it's positive. But GTA5 is not only SP. SP is just small part. Worst thng is online. Cheaters are running whole game! Rocsktar don't even have power over reaporting system. I've never seen anything like that. Devs have no authority over their own servers! WOW! Every part of this mode is made to frustrate players. 10 years of layered crap content also make mess in whole game. Even UI is a mess. Inflation is eating this game. Do not buy. If you have to, don't buy Steam version. Yes, it's different than R-launcher version. Steam one is crashing way, way more, than R-launcher copy. It's just BAD!"
shitty game isnt fucking starting fuck off you shitty fat cunts
Very good campaign. Online could use a better anti-cheat
the game is very funy
This is the only which cannot be replaced by any other game in the world .

It makes my laptop go boom
you have fun but it destroys your insides and mice.
"Bought specifically to play GTA online, just to check it out after 10 odd years not touching it. Needless to say it hasn't changed much. The Online experience is plagued with cheaters, currency selling spam bots that destroy your eardrums and content solely tailored towards group play. I'm getting old already and my friends don't have time to sit down with me for a 5 hour GTA session. But honestly, I'm just not interested in tailoring my time around others. So I've been playing private lobbies. Fine, whatever, but this leads me to the content offered to my level 15 (only because some hacker was in my first game and was apparently giving everyone xp and cash every little while.) After the tutorial mission with Lamar, you're literally thrown into overwhelming positions and or missions you have no means to deal with.  -Mission to go steal van that has drugs in it. Sure, np. Nick the van and get chased and gunned down by 4 chasing vehicles because only have a pistol. Death, mission failed but hey, got points and money.... Real fun.  -Next I accept some of the criminal empire pack that came bundled with the game. F-ing clueless. So I pick CEO of the bank instead of leader of Bike gang. Take my first mission after spending about 10%  of my networth on bank and warehouse. One crate of narcotics, sweet. Just go and pick it up, there might be some resistance but I've spent some money at a gun van earlier and bought a decent rifle. Head towards the drop, Mayweather has intervened and taken off... IN A HELICOPTER?? The f........ Chased helicopter around for 20 minutes shooting at it with my rifle cause wtf else was I supposed to do? Of course it does nothing and fail because of timer. Half an hour wasted doing nothing but losing money.  I'm sure it's a good game played in a group. But as a ""new"" solo player just jumping in to explore content for the first time it was by far one of the worst online experiences I have ever encountered. The most fun I had was in the dressing room trying to make  my female avatar more pleasant to look at. The rest was stress, frustration and ultimately disappointment.  Not totally sure what I was expecting. Something along the lines of the single player with the option to run with other players. Of course I'll be (or at least trying to be) checking out more content but HS, after 10 years. This really shows the incompetence (or neglect?) of Rockstar.  Edit: The single player is as good as it was on release.. but that's it. Any and all content released for this game since, has been for GTA online. So if you want a true solo experience you're gated to very limited content. The push to live service is obvious, they can milk people for money but always multiplayer all the time spoils the experience. Be it trolls, spam, cheaters/hacks. It's just unappealing. There's a reason why genuine MMOs and singleplayer online games like Genshin and Honkai cater to solo players."

"GTA V First off i'd just like to say how well the developers and everyone whos worked on this have done. This game is amazing and very well thought through, also the graphics are amazing and the game play is great. I also think that they have thought about the character that you play as very well. This is just a small and quick summery of the game itself. But overall i think it is a fantastic game and if you haven't got this then what are you waiting for! Download it now! :)"

"Bee Movie By Jerry Seinfeld  NARRATOR: (Black screen with text; The sound of buzzing bees can be heard) According to all known laws of aviation,  : there is no way a bee should be able to fly.  : Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.  : The bee, of course, flies anyway  : because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. BARRY BENSON: (Barry is picking out a shirt) Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.  : Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. JANET BENSON: Barry! Breakfast is ready! BARRY: Coming!  : Hang on a second. (Barry uses his antenna like a phone)  : Hello? ADAM FLAYMAN:  (Through phone) - Barry? BARRY: - Adam? ADAM: - Can you believe this is happening? BARRY: - I can't. I'll pick you up. (Barry flies down the stairs)  : MARTIN BENSON: Looking sharp. JANET: Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. BARRY: Sorry. I'm excited. MARTIN: Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.  : A perfect report card, all B's. JANET: Very proud. (Rubs Barry's hair) BARRY= Ma! I got a thing going here. JANET: - You got lint on your fuzz. BARRY: - Ow! That's me!  JANET: - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! (Barry flies out the door) JANET: Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! (Barry drives through the hive,and is waved at by Adam who is reading a newspaper) BARRY== - Hey, Adam. ADAM: - Hey, Barry. (Adam gets in Barry's car)  : - Is that fuzz gel? BARRY: - A little. Special day, graduation. ADAM: Never thought I'd make it. (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving) BARRY: Three days grade school, three days high school... ADAM: Those were awkward. BARRY: Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM== You did come back different. (Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging) ARTIE: - Hi, Barry!  BARRY: - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. ADAM: - Hear about Frankie? BARRY: - Yeah. ADAM== - You going to the funeral? BARRY: - No, I'm not going to his funeral.  : Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.  : Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. ADAM: I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the highway)  : I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular day. BARRY: I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations. (Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating students) Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. (Barry and Adam sit down and put on their hats)  : - Well, Adam, today we are men.  ADAM: - We are! BARRY= - Bee-men. =ADAM= - Amen! BARRY AND ADAM: Hallelujah! (Barry and Adam both have a happy spasm) ANNOUNCER: Students, faculty, distinguished bees,  : please welcome Dean Buzzwell. DEAN BUZZWELL: Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of...  : ...9:  : That concludes our ceremonies.  : And begins your career at Honex Industries! ADAM: Will we pick our job today? (Adam and Barry get into a tour bus) BARRY= I heard it's just orientation. (Tour buses rise out of the ground and the students are automatically loaded into the buses) TOUR GUIDE: Heads up! Here we go.  ANNOUNCER: Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. BARRY: - Wonder what it'll be like? ADAM: - A little scary. TOUR GUIDE== Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco  : and a part of the Hexagon Group. Barry: This is it! BARRY AND ADAM: Wow. BARRY: Wow. (The bus drives down a road an on either side are the Bee's massive complicated Honey-making machines) TOUR GUIDE: We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life  : to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.  : Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.  : Our top-secret formula  : is automatically color-corrected,  scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured  : into this soothing sweet syrup  : with its distinctive golden glow you know as... EVERYONE ON BUS: Honey! (The guide has been collecting honey into a bottle and she throws it into the crowd on the bus and it is caught by a girl in the back) ADAM: - That girl was hot. BARRY: - She's my cousin! ADAM== - She is? BARRY: - Yes, we're all cousins. ADAM: - Right. You're right. TOUR GUIDE: - At Honex, we constantly strive  : to improve every aspect of bee existence.  :"
been playing 8  hours straight that i forgot i was cooking something my whole house burn
yes veery good
"Game was amazing years ago, but too many hackers now."
"Can't join an online game, get an error."
Worth it.
gg but there are many hacker i often face them in online but it is a fun game
uh yeah cool game it was probably worth the money but it took like 5 hours to download but it runs at 60 fps? idk how that makes sense but yeah its good.
can actually run more than 30 fps
Just wait for the promotions then but the premium edetion good luck
the 2nd open world game i played after super Mario oddesy.
"While the General Concept of Grand Theft Auto is good, There are too many hackers at this point, you have a 60% chance(Or More) that any public session you go into will contain 1 hacker MINIMUM. Other than that, I seem to disconnect from hosts sessions a lot (Mainly Diamond Heists) before even being able to actually join them, causing a wasted 1-3 minutes in loading time every single time I go to try and join that the heist, you also have a lot of people who both kick you, fail to change their sessions to Private to avoid people constantly joining, leading to you being kicked since they only want their friend in there, OR you have hosts that start the mission, then either leave right after, or it's a joined player that leaves after it's already been started, leading to a huge frustration when trying to ever join in on Heists/Missions. You also have people that try and trick you and pull you into helping them with Setups for heists, but then most won't even invite you to the actual heist, leading you to not really want to help people with more of their setups."

"Warning, must have constant internet for use. If your internet is spotty, well that sucks for us I guess......  I paid for a copy of this game on every single platform. Starting with my PSP, to my 360.and ps3, And the ""program"" I 'own' must phone home for use every damn time. When I'm out camping I should be able to use my Ayaneo to play in a month, in 10 months of no internet.   I have owned many consoles, these are the first to always require internet."
"great game, fun for the whole family"
Game wont even load for me on steam lmao.
"This game is probably my favorite game to play right now. my only problems are that the anti cheat sucks, modding is so easy to spot in every lobby, and that the game isn't crossplay."

best online game everrrrrrrrrrrrr
"If this was 2013, and Obama was still president, I'd give GTA V a 10/10. But it's not 2013 anymore. And Rockstar Games refuses to leave this relic behind for newer titles due to pure greed.   GTA Online is a bloated, shameless, scam of a game that becomes more and more ridiculous with it's greed with with every update. Now they're removing hundreds of previously purchasable cars to put them behind a subscription service. If this was EA or Activision, Angry Joe and The Act Man would be leading a gamer mob to their headquarters. But Rockstar always gets a pass. And this has had dire consequences for gaming.  The fact that GTA V has been milked as long as it has, and red dead online, the supposed ""greatest game ever"" according to Kotaku journalists, had its online mode abandoned so early, has sent a clear message to Rockstar and take two that they can do whatever they want, and nobody will stop them. No amount of despicable anti consumer practices will ever be punished because ""omg guys, GTA VI might come out one day!""   I hate the legacy GTA V, and GTA Online have left for gaming. It sent a clear message to scumbag AAA developers that this kind of nonsense would be tolerated. Just look at Overwatch 2, or anthem, or cyberpunk, or sea of thieves, or no man's sky, or battlefront 2. This is all a result of a post GTA online landscape.   GTA V, I curse the day you ever came out."
Mid dating game too many actual dating elements 5/10
I have killed countless civilians. 200/10
it nice
"Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece! The open-world, storyline, and graphics are top-notch. Highly recommended!"
"I steal car and drive fast, good game."
Do you like games full of hacks? Do you want something that takes 10 minutes to sign into online? Well Rockstar has the game for you!
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh is preeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeettttttttttty good
i love stealing shit
"shit game, basically locks you out of online if you don't play for a while"
It's an ok game. Kind of overrated.
How can you hate this masterpiece! besides the ass fucker mk 2
great family friendly game for all ages
wewewewew
It has cars
"Thand Greft Dauto, the fifth. Com with onrline, which id lrike the normel gam, but onlien. Hrope this helping you decride yoir purchass"
"Bought a car and instantly had a plane crash into it, and someone blew it up. 10/10"
asasdasd
I accidentally ran over an old lady  oh yeah the game is pretty fun too
"It's an absolute blast!!! You have the freedom to pursue whatever you desire, whether it's starting a business, engaging in thrilling races, or simply having a good time. Personally, I find great enjoyment in orchestrating heists alongside my friends and taking to the skies in planes. I wholeheartedly recommend this experience for a mature audience!"
got banned because i restarted my pc which makes no sense
i love ragdoll physics
THIS GAME IS SO SH1T I HOPE ROCKSTAR COMMIT S8ICIDE
I love killing random people
"yeah the game is great everyone loves it but despite it being like 9 years old I think it would be cool if rockstar actually cared about online, finding a session without a cheater or modder is nearly impossible. Its in my opinion ridiciulus that you have to play with ur internet just to get session without people."
"W Game, L Company"
It is cool
"Don't buy it, because it's always prompted me to be online even thought it's offline no matter how many times you launch the launcher it always prompted to be online, on ps4 version once installed no matter how many times you launch it stays offline just get the pirated version instead."
yee yee ass haircut
steal car fun shoot gun fun
"its ok, just wish i could have bigger boobs"
NGL ITS ASS \
"I loved playing this game when it first came out great game. Infact I came back to visit just to find out that my rockstar social account got hacked. After contacting Rockstar support, they returned the account no problem. I got everything fixed and was able to play the game once more for about two weeks and guess what happens.  I get email from rockstar asking to confirm my account all in Chinese and cannot play it!  How you guys just gonna let these guys keep taking our games like this. Its a serious issue for anyone looking to get the future titles like GTA 6."
нет
"we just want gta 6 now this game is starting to get irrelevant and mods, fivem and storymode are the only things holding this game online is just full of moders now its to a point its not worth playing unless you can get a friend who mods to help through heists"
great game to play and im excited for gta 6!
its sooo realistic and i want GTA 6
"It's just plain fun. There's a whole lot of freedom and story within the game to explore. There is so much detail put into this game when considering it's age.   I do with Rockstar would do a bit better of a job with hackers and ""glitchers"" in the online mode because there are some ridiculously game-breaking things going on sometimes."
"Hookers, Drugs, Guns all of the 3 so V good"
"No, just no. This game wants me to make an account before I can play it, just like so many other games these days. No, f u c k o f f, I've had it. I'm fed up. I just want to play the game, not make an account for every single piece of software I bought a license for."
"PC lobbies often have hackers I can't lie but a enjoyable game nonetheless especially if you grab it on sale, years worth of content here to sink your teeth into when it comes to the online gameplay."
best realist game out there
"i7frt6gjhtbkn,m,"
best game everrrrrrr
the story mode is amazing it gives you lots of free space to do whatever you want great game
I mod and have sex with girls.
hgfghf
Game is really fun and lots of stuff to do

"Now days it's pretty lame, but back in the days it created some of best memories"
good but GTA SA better
you get chased by naked monks
i accidentally left gta open ive played like 20 hours but good game frfr get it
"Excedllent, can't really fault the game.  Stunning graphics, brilliant gameplay.  Always something new to do.  Playing online adds to the fun."
you can pick up hookers and make them give you sloopy toppy i have 50 hours on this game and 40 of them were me getting sloopy topppy
Not recommended for younger players. But the game is great and also great to play with friends.
"Absolute blast with friends, I love motorcycles and planes in this game and honsetly get a session out of just mountain biking or flying, note the average play is a 10 year old who plays constantly and will try bully you... gta online isn't very noob friendly."
"was gifted game, muy good"
Very good game for mods :)
"The god damn oppressors keep on raping me, like dawg leave me alone fr remove oppressor please"
it wwork some times
Super game to play 10/10 even with the cheaters:)
i can blow up innocent npcs now :D
i wouldnt let my worst enemy play this trash
this is a pice of cake
"GTA 5 is a good game, but Rockstar's security is so horrendous that even only playing offline singleplayer is enough to get your account hijacked from hackers.  Someone being able to change YOUR email AND YOUR password for YOUR account from THEIR account without any confirmation from YOU in YOUR account, is completely unacceptable and is enough for me to give a negative rating."

"Hello possible GTA 5 consumers, this game is good well the single player is its action packed awesome story good gun play and better driving then in GTA 4 and the characters special ability mechanic is very cool, and GTA online is insanely mediocre and is filled with hackers who can even see your IP!!! if ur gonna play gta online prepare to be BORED and use a vpn! stay safe."
Good game its very corny and i love it
i like it becuz it funnnn
"Gta online has been milked dry, the matchmaking sucks and you are lucky to even find a lobby without a modder. Fun with friends but that's it"
"Ah yes, Grand Theft Auto. The game series i grew up with. Actually, ive learmed English thru this game. When i was just 4 years old i was already playing GTA IV. with like 7 i started playing GTA V on my brothers PS3, then PS4 abd now PC and PS5. God knows how many years later im still here playing this game.   Story: 10/10 Full with Action, and really good storytelling.  Graphics: PS3: 8/10 for its time it was advanced PS4: 7/10 It has good graphics but PS5 and PC: 10/10 becouse even tho this used to be a PS3 game and is over 10 years old, the graphics are amazing on these two platforms.  Gameplay: 10/10 it just feels amazing, without doubt the best gameplay i had ever seen, untill RDR2 came out.  DLCs: 5/10 used to be amazing but got let down by Rockstar Games and now the new DLCs are just boring. 2 DLCs every year, one in summer and one in winter.  Overall: 8/10 Its just an amazing game i grew up with and even learned a whole language from. If you are thinking about buying it to play the story, do it, its worth it. Online is fun, but buying the game alone for the story is enough. I bought some VR glasses, and later found out that you can play this game with a mod in VR. I played the whole story in VR, it was just amazing.  Thank you Rockstar Games for this title, you made my childhood.  (and Leon even tho we planned to make Operation Militarybase when we was in 3. grade, ad you cant park the Jet you stole in your garage even tho we thought we chould, we have to do it one day (WHEN YOU FINALLY GET YOUR PC))   -Blxfroxt"
"Even though Rockstar games have become EA's grandchild this game is in contention for the GOAT Title IMHO,"
guyASDfcuxtys
fun W/ friends
impatiently waiting on GTA VI even tho I haven't even finished GTA V story mode ::::::))))))
"Shitton of stuff is thrown right at you, and you have no idea where to start, what to do, what is there available from the very beginning, how to start some random DLC RGB LBGT+ update that came out 4 years ago, 3/4 of content requires other people to play.  Your phone is constantly spammed with random bullshit of new stuff unlocked available blah blah blah. UI is horrible, making even Ubisoft design team look good in comparison.   In my 5 hours of playing this, I've managed to rob a few stores, complete 1 race, steal an RV and deliver it to some place, also got a free house and an armored car.   Whats my objective? How to progress the game? Nah, dude, you dont need that, so basically here is some random popup that sends you to a mission with $6000 award.   Jesus Christ, what a mess."
"TLDR: The game WAS great. Online isn't worth trying to get into if you haven't already. But, if you just want a fun singleplayer story campgain, the game is still acceptable.   At its core, this game is timeless. It's fantastic for wasting time, whether you enjoy roaming around in singleplayer with a mod menu (or playing the campaign) or screwing around in gta online with friends, but the recent monetization updates have really been trying to kill the online aspect of gta. If you are a new player and you are unwilling to purchase money through shark cards or other micro transactions, it's really not worth trying to get into. And even if you are willing to spend the extra money, be prepared to deal with infinite black screen loading bugs (brought on by modders in the lobby) and other griefing from hackers and modders. And even if you get lucky enough to not be in a lobby with them, good luck avoiding idiots riding flying bikes and shooting you with missiles just because you exist in the lobby."
gud game gta online isnt playable play story mode
shoot people= good. online is dogshit
love it!

"since i can not write a review for steam - i am going to do it here.  i hate steam.  it is like going to your refrigerator but every time 100% of the time you go to your fridge you are bombarded with sales, spams, 50% deals etc.  I AM NOT BUYING ANYTHING OFF OF STEAM UNTIL CHRISTMAS 2024.  AND I WILL CONSIDER GAMES OUTSIDE OF STEAM DURING THIS TIME OF NOT CONSIDERING STEAM GAME PURCHASING.  I AM SICK OF YOU STEAM.  YOU HAVE PEOPLE EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD WITH GAMES CRASHING, HORRIBLE GAME DEALS, CAN'T FIX THE GAME,  SO INSTEAD OF HELPING YOUR CUSTOMERS WITH OUR PRODUCTS - YOU SPAM US - GREED GREED GREED.  I AM SICK OF YOUR S**T STEAM.   YOU BETTER READ THIS STEAM - AND PASS IT UP THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.     DO YOU THINK THAT LOGIC SOUNDS GOOD?  YOU WOULD GLADLY JUST SEND US OVER TO CUSTOMER SUPPORT FOR THAT GAME THAT CRASHED - I KNOW - BUT SEVERAL GAMES CRASH!!!  SO LET'S JUST NOT WORRY ABOUT HOW THE GAMES ARE DOING - CRASHING OR NOT - AND TRY TO SELL MORE GAMES.   GREED IS NOT LOGICAL!  PEOPLE END UP TAKING SHORTCUTS TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK - THEN PEOPLE REALIZE THAT YOU ARE A GIMMICK AND START BUYING FROM ELSEWHERE."
Best game ever i used to play.
very smexy game
"its a good game except for the very toxic people in public sessions, luckily you can play in a private sessions either solo or with friends so i would recommend you do your business in private with no risk or public with friends protecting you."
"Good game yes it is old 10 years but is still  good to buy in 2023 and 2024 got many cars , planes and building main part of the games are the heist you can pick from domsday act 1-2-3 dimond casino big con , sneaky and silent and agresive and  the best heist  Cayo Perico . Game is good buy it when is on discount for 15$ is takes up 109gb which in not that much by todays standars."

Haven't played since download because Rockstar is useless and has my account linked to some scammer
"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, my son invited me and he took us into a casino heist.. I was a bit confused about the games mechanics and so I asked my Son for help. my son hosted a game for me to join so he could teach me how to drive a car and how to purchase weapons, we had an absolute blast. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
"Game crashed once, bad"
One of the most enjoyable games with almost too much stuff to do

Dude. Holy fart man.
Its a very fun game and it teaches you on how the real worlds would most definitely recommend.
THIS IS FUCKING AWESOMEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
big poo poo
I love this game wish I was older so I played this sooner
fuck you niggas
THIS GAME MAKES ME BUSS EVERYWHERE OH MY SHOUT OUT TO TREVOR MY BOI!!!!!
"The friends were imperfect in one way or another, so they helped each other to fill what they were lacking and embarked on a journey to make their wishes come true. The Scarecrow wanted a brain, the  Tin Woodsman wanted a heart, the Cowardly Lion wanted courage, and Dorothy  wanted to return home.  The one they thought to be the great wizard instead gave the Woodsman a lead heart.  ""But you're a machine, that means you were built to serve humans. Don't you understand? Machines don't need a heart. Good job making it all the way here though, take this as compensation. Be sure to tell  everyone waiting for you that your wish definitely came true.""  Some left with satisfaction. The friends departed and were never to be seen again. The hard, cold lead was depressing.   The Tin Woodsman couldn't agree with this. In anger, he swung his axe through the wizard's heart. The warm heart was pulsing vigorously. He shoved the lead into the wizard's now empty chest. For the first time in his life, the Woodsman started laughing at the sight, and felt a pleasure he'd never had before.  Grabbing a chunk of mushy hearts, he shoves it into his ""chest."" There will never be enough hearts. Once a Woodsman, he now cuts down people instead of trees. This is a forest full of hearts. No matter how many he cuts down, the forest still remains dense. A kind person would carry a warmer heart.  When the heart is lost, the Woodsman will fall to his knees in sorrow, clutching his empty chest. As if begging for the only thing he has left not to be taken"
"its like, good n shi yfm for fr ongwallop"
I recommend playing this game for idiots like me who love to shoot bitches and shoot their asses B)
fggggggfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
"In case I would like to play just story mode in offline, I don’t able to start game…  Same sh1t with all rockstar launcher games, so if you are planing to pass this game, you must have internet connection, if not BB"
dont play
"this game is almost older than me. yet you fucking weebs at rockstar games wont release another GTA title until your fucking stone age game dies, oh and whoopty doo, fuck me sideways its only going to be on next gen. real round of applause for the fat fucking losers at rockstar who wont make a new damn game but will take 5 fucking years to make 1 car not a single person in the fucking world would actually buy and when you fucking bitch ass losers make something cool its like 100 million fucking dollars, now, look at me, i could be enjoying my life, meeting new people, talking and spending time with friends, getting a grilfriend but guess what... Fuck that this new hellcat looks sick as fuck and wow, look at my fatass on this shitass heist called ""cayo perico"", like fuck me this damn thing takes an hour for 1 million dollars and all im doing is stealing from a drugged fatass Colombian dude. I would make an attempt to buy a modded account at this point but they are more expensive than your fucking game, and while we are on the topic of expensive, lets talk about your shark cards, like 100 real fucking dollars for 8 mil? just whip your dick out and slap me with it. then when i finally get this sick ass vehicle that looks so nice, a fucking transformer with down syndrome buys a modded account and rips all that shit away and takes my ip and sells it to a black dude in west africa to hire people to come and kidnap me and rape me well just come and do it please because its probably better for my soul to have 19 stds from being passed around like a vape in the locker room except its not little kids its big fucking black dudes bending me over and fucking me. dont know how i went from GTA - black gang rape but it'll buff, also i have your name saved on my phone, ""deemon-sp33d922"" please give me my shit back i ran cayo so many times for you to fuck me and take all my shit. also the modders that give you money and do a good deed for the world, bless your heart, i hope your pillow is cold tonight and you are a great person, if you mod to fuck people over you should genuinely kill yourself and climb mount Everest buttass naked to you freeze to death, please if you do kill yourself why you do it can you facetime me because i want to see the fatass bitch and took my shit away and sold me as a sex slave in kenya. please fucking shoot yourself i hope your small ass dick pics get leaked and you have to be home schooled by your down sydrome retard uncle and your old musty ass aunt becasuse we both know if you mod GTA to fuck me your parents were never in the picture. go fuck yourself. please. 10/10 game"

I hope you have a good pc
fum play wit tim alot
The Great Game of This Current Era
"the story mode doesn't have a lot of vehicles to choose from, compared to online mode They have more vehicles to buy like yachts and jet fighters but it's annoying to play online because you sometimes get killed by other players a dozen times And it doesn't help when you have to travel to mission/ activities to earn money instead of selecting those missions from a menu, And every time you die you always lose ammo that you didn't even shoot yet so you're left with no ammunition To defend yourself after a while of getting killed, So I have to wait a couple hours maybe even the next day to play again."
To many cheaters. Couldn't play a single session without several.
love it. ive been running from the cops for an hour now
Great game. Really fun.

just dont get it
fix your fucking game. you have god mode griefers in every session that can't be killed no matter how much fucking damage is poured into them. absolutely unplayable trash
i think this is a very fun game but its better when you mod
"Very fun game, the Multiplayer is such a good experience if you play in private lobbies, because public lobbies are full of modders and griefers, and they made it so you can do everything you can do in a public in a private, so it's much better."
awsome game and fun to drive around and run from the cops
Online sucks
"Unfortunately the online mode for this wonderful game has been ruined by cheaters, so if you want a good experience I suggest just modding the story mode and goofing around then, just do not become a loser and cheat in this game online, you will be proving points on many opinions."
it is a ok game
"The removal of all the cheap speed has made the game either very hard or very boring at the beginning in Online. It was an obvious cash grab as almost all the remaining cars start at 1million. There are some good guides on the YouTubes or Twitch that will tell you how to navigate the early game. The minute they open up another dealership or two and return all the cars removed, I cannot in good conscious recommend the game. If you do play, get friends, grind slow, and do not buy shark cards."
Gta is fun play it I like the free world and free roam world the game is realistic and I be playing FiveM makes it more fun
princess bubble gum anime
"The GTA series is beyond reviews.  If you do not know what your are getting you have been living under a rock since GTA3.  So here is a tip.  When you start a new story mode, just do the main story missions.  When you finish the story you will have plenty of money, side missions, and things to discover and do to entertain you for a long time.  and most importantly, the map will be explored."
totally unplayable
"op,kl[pkopk[op]k"
play for 10mins get bored play again in a month
its good but better on console and you need a good pc to play
Dont buy this for gtaonline
baols
"i really love when i meet a young woman on the corners! they are always down to hop in my whip, slide on some opps from franks hood and then help me finish! definetly reccomend to all of my friends dawg dont let me catch you lacking or me and my grils will have to mess ya up you know what i saying dawgs dont frick wit ogs dud"
best game to chill out and have a fun time
"Great game overall but I gotta say, it sucks on pc. If you do play on pc... use a controller"
good poo
COOL BEANS
good place if you want to fantasise about killing in real life
YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Love the game and cant wait for GTA 6
It was fun till it lasted. When it just came out I played 100s of hours. But right now it's just unplayable mess and online sessions are filled with cheaters.  Do not f-cking buy this game to play online. You can pirate it for single player because rockstar got too greedy to deserve your dollar IMO.
Dosent load
"багато нєгрів, ставлю клас"
"I wouldn't recommend it. Its full of modders that just grief ur session. Sure you can fuck around with friends and kill each other, but the rest of the game is just stale"
theres always new stuff to discover
darkviperAU is cool
"Naturally this doesn't matter cause GTA V is old, but love it. Just don't expect controller to work like steam says it does. It doesn't :("
I think we all know this is a pretty solid game. In my opinion it dips and peaks between different events/DLC they release. At this point I don't think it is possible to join a lobby that does not have at least 2 hackers/modders in it. Whether or not this is a good or bad thing is subjective. I basically pay for the majority of the in-game content with money dropped by modders so...... you know
very cool and funny4

"really fun, wish there was more npc stores though"
This Game Is A W

love to get bummed by oppressor
worst game ever lol
Yes but it c you should be 18 or older to play
this is so bad  people always use mods and when your in a public sesion they kill and mess with you
this is a scam
"If you like causing chaos, spending a whole lot of money on outfits, and feeling like a boss after you kill a new player. Then this is the game for you"
i cant fly planes
For all your chaotic desires!
not ednough gay sex
"There is literally hackers, and they can't do shit about it, there's a reason I don't play public and it's been like this since the ps3 days.  It's fun with friends, not fun with randoms, nice job Rockstar, GTA VIce better be fucking worth it, it won't because you're riding Take Two's glizzy 24/7."
"nobody reads reviews anyway so i can just say it, im gay"
great game love un-aliving the npc´s

"GTA V is a game that has quickly become a classic, offering a one-of-a-kind open-world gaming experience. With an engaging storyline and well-developed characters, the game offers a story that you can follow through the eyes of three different protagonists.  The game is beautifully designed, with cinematic-quality graphics and an impressive soundtrack. The Los Santos environment is large, varied, and offers an immersive experience you won't want to leave. There's so much to do in the open world of GTA V, you could spend hours just exploring, biking, golfing, and more.  The multiplayer mode, GTA Online, is also offered fun, providing a different gameplay experience than the single-player campaign. You can create your own character, buy properties, run errands, participate in heists and many other online activities with your friends.  All in all, GTA V is an exciting, beautifully crafted and action-packed game that delivers an unforgettable gaming experience. With an engaging storyline, memorable characters, cinematic-quality graphics, and an outstanding soundtrack, this game is a modern classic that every gamer should try. If you're looking for an open-world game with a wide variety of things to do, GTA V is the game for you."
"good stuff, all the vehicles look cool. Honestly the only downside for ME are the grinding and griefers and of course, the loading time. great game tho."

YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

Really good story
dfdfd
"its really fun to play it, it has really good graphics"
GOD IS GOOD GOD IS GREAT
GTA 5 one of the best game to enjoy with friend online
100% RECOMMENDED!
I am very tired and don't feel like writing this review. You already know this game; its been out for like ten years now or something.
ilikeit
This is a very fun game exept for the many hackers in it.
gud=)
"fun but there are many modders, and as a new player it is hard to make money without buying shark cards"
"Fuck Rockstar, fuck Tencent, the fact that this game is so highly reviewed makes me sad. If you're buying the game at this point, DONT. ESPECIALLY if you plan to use GTA Online. Rockstar has proven they do not give a flying fuck about the community, I don't care how good GTA6 might be I am not buying it on principle and you shouldn't either."
fun game if you don't try online as the first thing you do
monkjeys
A piece of sexy art
"I would've recommended this game like 5 years ago. GTA Online is fucking trash. It's sad but not surprising to see that Rockstar took out many vehicles so they can put them in their dumb rotations(i.e. the lucky wheel and ls car meet). I'm tired of jumping through a million hoops to have fun with this game. Don't waste anymore of your time. Rockstar for a while has shown time and time again that they don't give a fuck about their player base, but it doesn't matter because the game is so massive anyway. They will just keep getting away with this shit through the end of this game and probably most of the next one. I have lost hope in this franchise that I once loved. A message Rockstar Games, release GTA 6 and quit milking this game dry you greedy pigs."
"Awesome story, memorable characters, great open-world game. Just finished this game this 2023, 12 years after the release of GTA V. Now, I can't wait to play GTA 6 in 2035 because my laptop will not be able to handle it in its release date 2025."
"When I was installing the game I was already banned, why? because I forgot you aren't allowed to go into Public sessions (THAT ROCKSTAR ADVERTISES) because your the one that gets banned and not the guy with the menu.   Don't worry you still can play the game you were promised but not by the people who created it. FiveM is a modification for Grand Theft Auto V enabling you to play multiplayer on customized dedicated servers, powered by Cfx.re."
the one piece is real
it is a fun game
i watched my grandpa say pe nis
*Sigh*
"If you've so much as glanced at GTAV on another platform and linked your social account to it, the Cockstar social club won't let you log in and you'll be told to ""Log in with a different social club user"" to continue. Apparently the technology to give each steam account a unique ID is too advanced. Other users have reported the same issue as well as waiting upwards of two weeks for a response from Cockstar's website, which even by modern AAA standards is unacceptable. If you're fine with owning nothing and being happy this is definitely the game for you."
You can run people over
you can punch woman its fun
its like gta 4 but its 5
its very fun when you kill that one person.
The loading times in this game are insane. Honestly not worth it sitting thru all the loading screens even with an i9 and nvme 2.0 ssd. frankly its pathetic
it good game michelle
it is a very good game
Best game to date.
"if you see this review, dont play this game no matter what"
i love that part when jimmy says the n word

its great!
"Single player is this game is fine, It is what you'd expect from a single player ""Crime-Lord"" Game, The ""No"" review is solely for only the online portion of this game.   Online Game-play is so extremely, Abhorrently, reprehensibly awful that is an easy pass, While they make starting up as tier 1 in this game difficult as life itself, you spend half of the time defending yourself from extremely toxic players, some are children and teenagers who have nothing better to do because they have no girlfriend or significant other to be with. anyway as a I digress.  Toxic players, toxic community, whaling is essentially required and is pretty much built into the game if you want to do anything that is worth while in this game. the ""Bad-Sport"" mentality pretty much does nothing to quell people from doing this.   They make the reward so worthless when compared to the risks that YOU DO take in this game. Hackers are not punished or reprimanded enough.   Unless RockShart changes MULTIPLE things that I do not like about this game, DO NOT SPEND YOUR 60$ on it. Or ignore my review like many other probably will and risk breaking your equipment or permanent hair loss from it leaving your head in frustration while playing this game."

AWESOME game
good game i like to play with friends
sure would be cool if my rockstar account wasnt hacked.  I am now locked out of every game and support hasnt gotten back to me in weeks
"I only have this stinky game cause a friend bought it for me because they wanted to play with me. And it was very sweet of them and of course I play this game if they want to. BUT JUST KNOW, I wouldn't have bought it on my own so L"
"Beware of grievers but there wont be too many of them, hackers wont get you banned or at least not in my experience, Great game worth every penny!"
"The best game I've ever played. Yes, the game contains a few bugs that annoy, but the game itself is fun. I recommend it to anyone who likes to play second person games, especially third person. Earning is quite easy when playing with friends maybe harder to do solo missions. I'm more of a Cs player than a GTA player but now my main game will be GTA V than Cs1.6 or Cs:Go.  I really recommend the game!"
this game is extremely mid. you cant have sex with the women
it good js need some money
got banned so not so good anymore.
CHOP
got rid off my gta online
drh
Best game ever made!
skrimello was here
"Weaker characters compared to the previous entries, a weaker story, lame radio stations, a giant empty map, and 'streamlined' gameplay that essentially boils down to walk and talk missions, escort missions, races and heists. On repeat.  You're also required to use their shitty 3rd party launcher to run the game, which can cause problems if you're trying to run this on a steamdeck or something similar.   The online portion of the game also contains one of the most disgusting and exploitative examples of monetization in a video game.   Overall just a waste of time. You're better off playing any other GTA title."
"I'm late to the game. This released 10 years ago, and now I'm catching up. Best fun I had in a long time. The main missions/storyline are a bit dull in my opinion, but GTA online makes up for it. 100/10"
I saw a woman
i saw a woman
"I mean shit, this kinda review is on every game, but my friend told me he would get me a sixpack of beer and some chips if I get some rewards of interactions. Every 10 awards he has to shotgun the most disgusting beverage I can find in a store."
"After years of playing this game across different consoles it has lost playable feeling, i cant login in a session and enjoy this game, feels like modders and hackers have more fun playing this game than me while i have to sit and grind four hours just to get a car i would like to customize modders hackers can just give them selves money and get what ever they want right then and there you get to meet some modders that make the game fun for acouple of minutes then its gone i miss the golden age of gta 5 not this maybe in the future will have a game thats for the players not for making money mabey"
leavin a honest review

"Where you can do everything you shouldn't do in real life, from high-speed chases to robbing banks, all while maintaining a wanted level that would make your mom proud! It's the ultimate crime simulator that will have you questioning your morals and laughing at the absurdity of it all. Just remember, it's all fun and games until the cops catch up to you!"
time wasting...
Still one of the best games to play with friends or alone. But where is GTA 6?
chop love s@x with random dog
its very fun and i play it with  my friends all the time
Mods are cray cray
"I have a love-hate relationship with this game. I haven't a clue what I'm doing but I love the creativity you can have with the builds and classes (the vast skill tree is a wonder to behold)!! Even if you don't know what you're doing, you can still play the game and have fun though; the replayability of the game is surprisingly good. There's so many different races to choose from and so many different enemies to fight as well!! The included multiplayer is also really fun for beginners.. You'd probably want to start with a long ranged build though. Anyways thanks for reading this, and happy hunting!!!"
Straight up masterpiece! Even a decade after the original release!
criminal42;
i liked it so much graphic are awsome
has been a great game sense 2012
"Trevor sigma, shout out Laemar, Story is 10/10. Online is shit, nothing to do after doing the same heists 100000000 times, EA tier microtransactions, 6/10 online."
"It's Gta, you get what you pay for..  literally"
BEST GAME EV ER
ohhhh nice game
"Game sucks, won't load. Don't buy."
Extremely fun game. basically you can do whatever you want that you can't do irl. You could fool around or you can rob places.  Definitely worth the huge storage.
"o.o uh... its been years... you drive, you shoot, you dance, you steal, you dress up, you die alot. Youtube game play, there is endless videos!!! but best of all, you can mod, their still making new mods... the games been free a few times, its super cheap. Idk what else to say, try it?   --- Offline Story aged well, love the characters and story  boos: you cant play for your custom character  Yays: you can mod to play as your custom character  --- Online A long, long time ago hackers crowded the streets with chaos Today, chaos is default nature and hackers war over territory! so pretty much the same, embrace the chaos :U  Boos: chaos... gonna die a lot  Yays: custom character!!!  --- Bonus! You can play online... off... line? huh? you can play solo online so yay? if you don't like the chaos and hackers.  Boos: wheres GTAVI?!?!?

"As an avid gamer and fan of the Grand Theft Auto series, I recently embarked on an adrenaline-fueled journey through the fictional streets of Los Santos in Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this installment, creating an open-world masterpiece that leaves players hooked from the very start.  The first thing that struck me about GTA V is its stunning visuals and attention to detail. The game's graphics are simply breathtaking, and the vast and diverse landscapes of Los Santos, from the bustling urban sprawl to the serene countryside, are meticulously crafted. The level of immersion is unparalleled as the city feels alive, with pedestrians going about their daily routines, AI-controlled cars obeying traffic rules, and dynamic weather effects adding to the overall realism.  The heart of GTA V lies in its captivating storyline, which revolves around three unique protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking redemption; Franklin, a young and ambitious gangster aiming for a better life; and Trevor, a chaotic and unpredictable character with a dark past. The seamless switch between these characters throughout the game allows players to experience the story from various perspectives, making it all the more engrossing.  Rockstar Games has excelled in creating characters that feel genuine, flawed, and relatable. Their development over the course of the game is nothing short of remarkable, drawing players emotionally closer to the narrative. The writing is sharp, laced with dark humor and unexpected twists that keep players constantly on their toes.  What truly sets GTA V apart is the sheer freedom it offers within its open-world environment. Players can engage in a plethora of activities, from taking on thrilling heists and daring missions to participating in various side quests and recreational endeavors. The world is your playground, and whether you're racing cars, playing golf, base jumping, or indulging in a game of tennis, there's never a dull moment.  The game's online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online, adds another layer of excitement to the already content-rich experience. With regular updates and a thriving community, the multiplayer aspect ensures that players will be entertained for countless hours beyond the main storyline.  However, it's worth noting that GTA V is intended for mature audiences due to its explicit content, violence, and language. While it contributes to the authenticity of the game's setting, parents should exercise caution and consider the game's rating before allowing younger players to delve into it.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is an exceptional masterpiece in the gaming industry. With its breathtaking graphics, engaging narrative, and unparalleled freedom, it sets the benchmark for open-world gaming experiences. Despite being released several years ago, GTA V's enduring popularity speaks volumes about its lasting impact on the gaming community. If you're a fan of action-packed adventures and immersive storytelling, this game is an absolute must-play."

"Do not buy in the year 2023 or onward. Do not support Rockstar. Only buy from a steam sale and ONLY for the story mode. Even then, expect dozens of bugs (For example, physics bugging and even fps drops if your fps is too high!)."

"Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack didn't receive items? I just bought the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack, installed it, launched the game and I didn't receive any of the items."
"I've practically grown up playing this game and it was absolutely flawless on PS4/PS5(Besides the ridiculous amount of griefers ruining the various businesses for anyone who doesn't have friends to protect them) but on PC, idk if it's just me but the servers seem to be horrible and are prone to glitching as well as just overall crashing. Console version 11/10, and PC version 6/10 would still recommend but needs some serious server improvements."
fun with fren

"love the game so fun, the hackers tho :/"
it was a greatr game for me
Nice open world game
good wow
Crime is cool it should be legal
bheaaaaaaaaah
Getting better
this is the best game ever storyline is great characters and their own story is the best it is surprising that the came out in 2013 but still has a strong fanbase i would definitely recommend this game
"Whilst the game in itself is fun, and the griefers seem to have subsided, modders are still rampant, and can do serious damage. Also, way too much content is made available to you at the beginning, and it can be extremely overwhelming, especially since you aren't given an explanation. Another thing, the game takes an unreasonably long time to load, and it often ends up just stuck in a loop of loading, and when tabbing out whilst loading in, the game may just crash. Heist missions have a tendency to crash a lot as well, so forget about playing one of the main parts of the game.  Singleplayer is ok.  All in all, I'd say get it if it's ever in a better state, or get another game."
"It's a very nostalgic game for me, I remember waiting at my local Wal-Mart to open first thing in the morning  to finally  get the first copy of  GTA 5, back in September 2013. i was 14 years old at the time and this game gave great memories.   Thank you RockStar for making a wonderful game <3"
its good i like it
One of the best games in this genre ever...
This game is for true gamers!!!!!!!!!!!

"Title: An Unforgettable Adventure in Los Santos - GTA V Delivers!  Review: I can't recommend Grand Theft Auto V enough! The open world in this game is absolutely incredible, offering endless possibilities for exploration and excitement. Whether I'm cruising through the bustling streets of Los Santos or venturing into the picturesque countryside, the level of detail is simply astounding.  The missions in GTA V are nothing short of superb. Each one feels unique and brings its own set of challenges and thrills. From high-speed heists to heart-pounding shootouts, the gameplay keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire journey.  And let's talk about the graphics - they are mind-blowing! The attention to detail in every aspect of the game, from the character models to the dynamic weather effects, truly elevates the gaming experience to a whole new level.  I've spent countless hours in Los Santos, and with each playthrough, I discover something new and exciting. The freedom to make choices, coupled with the rich narrative, keeps me coming back for more.  If you're a fan of open-world adventures and enjoy immersive gameplay, GTA V is an absolute must-play. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this masterpiece. So grab your virtual car keys and dive into the world of GTA V - you won't be disappointed!"
The game will not unistall and will not stop running
i steal thing from funny store. get 4 stars. call funny lester man. no more 4 stars:(
sdaadaa
gambling my problems away as we speak 10/10 gameplay
"Dont buy it, spend your money in other games. This game used to run great and I played it for 82 hours. Then the social club update came through and I have not been able to play it, constant crashes and not starting at all. I'm done with it and their customer service."
Fbi know what you do...
Amazing graphics as you all know. Also good for wanderers in open world.
i hate oppresers
"Ah jeez the state of the online just makes me sad. It used to be so simple back in the day, when the coolest person in the lobby was the dude in the gold helicopter picking everyone up. Now its just a hellfire warzone of flying cars with homing rockets and open world missions that cost so much money to do, and have such a low payout for the risk involved (other players destroying your cargo) its just not worth doing. Servers are a crap shot and connecting to your friends is a shot in the dark. If you live in different parts of the world its a 50/50 shot of being able to connect stably to each other. Single player is fun tho!"
its good i fw it
very fun game. hackers suck tho
Lot's of funn!!
cus it good
single player is S tier but the online only has 2 things to gen money heist or a boring monotonous fetch quest
Good game would reccomend!
"If you pa attention throughout playing the story or campaign, there is so many details that most dont notice or dont pay enough attention too and for a game that came out a decade ago its still really good for its time"
"Online is cool and all, but the story is very underappreciated. Definitely give it a go."
It sucks
Veru nice
cant even load it up cuz my pc is shit
Can be fun whit friends but its a very simple game get money buy buisness get more money buy house get money buy car get hella much money buy car whit jet motor attached

"Constant problems with servers, cant connect with friends and almost always it ends up with the 'connection lost' message. After eight years this game is still such a mess..."
"Haven't played this game in over 6 years, got back with the criminal pack dlc just recently and played some solo sessions with my mate and had a great time.  After a few hours playing solo with him i figured lets go online and see what the folks are up to! Be me in a clothing store minding my own business and some player thought it was a great idea to engage in a fire fight, after a few deaths from him flying his little speedy gonzales motorbike i finally sniped the guy and kept on spawn killing him a few times for revenge,  in the middle of that killing spree a hacker decided to kill everyone on the server by spawning something with a grenade launcher that was invincible and just kept on doing that for a solid 5-10 minutes before the server finally gave up.  im happy the playerbase haven't changed much since last time i played.  10/10 would definitely play again."
i love this ganme its so amazing and fun hell yes
my loading screen keeps freezing whenever im tryna load into the game and it just kicks me out
i love the bitches in the game

"Unraveling the Tapestry of Los Santos: Grand Theft Auto V  Score: 9.4/10  Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is a technical marvel and narrative powerhouse that marks a high point in the storied history of open-world gaming. This landmark title adeptly weaves a dense tapestry of story, action, and exploration, resulting in a gaming experience that is as provocative as it is fun. With a staggering level of depth and breadth, GTA V earns an impressive 9.4 out of 10.  GTA V's primary narrative is an intricate saga of crime and ambition, set against the backdrop of the sprawling city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas. The plot is made richer by the three protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, each with their own distinct personalities and storylines that intertwine brilliantly. The game's bold choice to allow players to switch between these characters at almost any point is innovative and provides a unique and engaging storytelling mechanism.  GTA V's open-world design is a testament to Rockstar's attention to detail and commitment to creating an immersive experience. Los Santos is a living, breathing city with diverse districts that accurately mirror the multicultural fabric of Southern California. From sun-kissed beaches and bustling downtown streets to arid desert expanses and towering mountain ranges, the world feels alive and is an absolute joy to explore.  The gameplay in GTA V offers a perfect balance between chaotic action and strategic planning. Whether you're engaging in high-octane car chases, meticulously planning and executing heists, or simply exploring the city in your downtime, the game constantly keeps you entertained. The cover-based shooting mechanics feel smooth, the driving is satisfyingly responsive, and the sheer variety of vehicles and weapons available adds to the game's replayability.  Graphically, GTA V is stunning. The level of detail, realistic physics, dynamic weather, and day-night cycle create an aesthetically pleasing and believable world. The voice acting is top-notch, and the radio stations with their various genres of music and entertaining talk-show segments significantly add to the game's atmosphere.  Additionally, the inclusion of GTA Online provides a robust and continually evolving multiplayer experience, where players can engage in a plethora of activities, from races and deathmatches to cooperative heists, further extending the game's lifespan.  Nevertheless, the game is not without its flaws. Some may find the game's portrayal of violence and its treatment of certain societal issues controversial. Also, although GTA Online is a rich addition, it occasionally suffers from server issues and an environment that may be unwelcoming to newcomers.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V stands as an exemplar in the realm of open-world games. Its engaging narrative, meticulously crafted world, diverse gameplay mechanics, and compelling multiplayer component make it a game that any player can appreciate. While not without its minor setbacks and potential controversy, the scale and quality of what it offers are undeniable, making GTA V a must-play title in the annals of gaming history."
crazy drug dealing game

"Well, well.... I admit that this game is one of the best that I've played. It's worth it to buy if you don't ever play the game: the story line, graphics, character development, mini games, mechanics, etc. It makes me want to play again and again."

"Nice story and gameplay, but a liitle bit easy so it is good for just chillin and gaming"

"GTA 5 stands unparalleled as the quintessential gaming masterpiece, epitomizing the pinnacle of interactive entertainment. Rockstar Games' magnum opus seamlessly blends a sprawling open-world environment with gripping narrative intricacies, rendering an immersive experience unlike any other. Its unparalleled attention to detail crafts a living, breathing virtual realm, inviting players to traverse the urban expanse of Los Santos and Blaine County with boundless freedom. The game's compelling characters, witty dialogue, and engrossing missions weave a cinematic tapestry that keeps players captivated from the first moment to the last. Add to this the cutting-edge graphics, relentless action, and ever-evolving online component, and GTA 5 emerges as a timeless legend, redefining the gaming landscape and forever engraving its place as the unrivaled apex of gaming excellence."
All progression suddenly deleted.
it wont ducking close its been running for two weeks straight
"Don't know what to tell you, the game is underwhelming even disappointing. I'm not into MMO/online games and so only played story mode, but I feel if you like shooter games there are a ton of superior games; if you like, you know, everything else that supposed to be GTA well this will be disappointing!   The world is barely interactive, if at all, mechanics junky and frustrating, a ton of bugs God knows how many years after release, story so so. Coming from not having played a lot of action and instead RPGs, this has been a sad lament for the great days of GTA San Andreas"
"Guys don't worry it is so easy to level up and make cash just find a lobby with a hacker, befriend him, and you're good :)"
GTA 6 will come out after I die of old age.
Always a good game no matter what you're doing driving around to doing missions
instead of adding things fix the dam bugs
"While online is mostly just a cash-grab pay to win massacre for new players the story mode is absolutely legendary with great story, graphics that still look good years later, and decent replay-ability due to it having several different endings, also the attention to detail is amazing."
lame asf
I liked ittttt

"its a cool game in general just as to enjoy playing with friends, fun as well. it has much to do so you wont get bored that fast. recommendable to everyone imo"
the L in Lockstar stands for the biggest L in the gaming industry
too many modders and hackers. the game is not even fun no more. you waster hundreds of hours and a modder can take everything with a clic. im  unistalling this game
"i mean its gta, so yes its good"
Fun as fuck
"I wish that Steam had a ""meh"" option as IMO GTA 5 deserves a meh, for new players id say its worth buying for the story, but online is a bit overwhelming with everything you need to buy in able to start making money for real.  The story mode is great and fun to play, its always worth playing a Rockstar story mode  The Online has grown extremely stale to me over the years, I'll always get in a pattern of loving the game for a month then hating everything about it for 3 months and its been like this for the last 5 years, half of its lifespan I've been either loving online or wanting to play something else and forget that it even exists. Not to mention that the prices of everything have skyrocketed in online, yet the value of shark cards have stayed the same, really 8 mil is not a whole lot anymore.  At this point they just need to move on to GTA 6 and let GTA 5 die already"
good game very
"Good game, entertaining and fun to mess around in"
it is so fun of it haves mods
"Tried to make an account, didn't work cause of a error that says ""we could not create sign in token."""
always fun and never boring. complaints are world record races are impossible. other then that i would like to see toxic players reigned in. like its really bad i can't go into a pubic room without hearing racist statements death threats or bullying. Rockstar does nothing about them. private rooms are fun though. just stay clear of public rooms.
i love to drive car :steamhappy:
Buy it and HF
good shit matie
"Here's the one and only reason to buy a PS5, Xbox, or STEAM subscription. It's the Gold Standard of gaming."

Best Forever ! GO for it .. Recommended !!
The Best Game of the Decade...
DELETED A LOT OF CARS WITH A DUMB EXCUSE
Guns go pew pew
worst game ever
It's Still Good With Mods And Stuff!
siroba
"so much better than the old game, 3 more heists and they are massive filled with content aswell as having way more just around-the-map content to play with."
"Making a review for gta in 2023 is like women having rights. In short, a great game, but for some reason I order a car in the game and it says that it appears in my parking lot, I don't see it at home, I go out every day to check and there is no car in my yard, I was cheated. I'm looking forward to my car, thank you. I also happen to be single so if you are a beautiful Russian woman reading this send me a message."
Great game for having fun the biggest problem is almost everything is too expensive
really good game i have played hours on this and i would recommend the game
I had fun playing it but one thing is there no mods rockstar add mods
KYUIYUJT6RY
doesn't launch
i can not login in rockstar social club plz check the what is problem will be acuard.they say email cannot be show in surver plz solve the problem @team steam
wewewewe
excellent game really ast and real shit in it
kkkk
Good game but the online is really really really bad
Very good game pare chong kasi i like cars and shiii
Has it's hiccups but still one of the best singleplayers on the market. Multiplayer is pretty much cancer now unless you play invite only lobbies with friends
decent game but gets boring and repetetive after some time
amazing game even 2023 me and my friends love playing this game so muchwould reccomend to anyone
Best game ever. Period.
this game is very good i like this game
cops invaded my house :(
wwwswws3g4fexvbx c
I like hitting and hit the innocent
boom bam car blow up fun
Don't play it
i hate it i was GRINDING THE HELL and then there is a message that says YOU HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR 30 FUCKIN DAYS PLUS THE NEW UPDATE REMOVES SOO MANY CARS I JUST BOUGHT IT 3 DAYS AGO ROCKSTAR i HIGHLY do NOT reccomend this FRIKIN GAME
"Great campaign, great open world.  The online is also awesome as long as you're free roaming.  Once you try entering matchmaking, it becomes garbage.  It's really fun building your empire in the online space though - way more interesting than it otherwise is in the main story world.  As you'd expect in a GTA game, the driving and car variety is very solid.  There are so many things to do and explore that this is possibly the best open world game you can pick up outside of an MMO.  Therefore if you have any interest in that genre, you should enjoy this."
One of the best games ive had on steam. I got it for a cheap price because steam always have a deal for gta its crazy. I really recommend it for new player to steam
"I waited so long for GTA VI, That my hair is the same color of my teeth. We are tired of waiting!"
cant get past the train in the first mission
"game was fun until those modders or hacker joined, they teleport me everywhere and keep losing money, where are the fun anymore, man tried to tell me use the mod but i dont find it fun when they can drop me from the sky or putting me in  jail, those need to ban the steam account because they would to that to others players in other games, trying to ruin other moods when they keep getting shit on in real life so now they throwing tantrums in games on other players jaja, i find it funny because its about patience"
it is very fun to play with your friends
A fabulous game. There is so much of attention to details.
"Horrible game this is no hood game at all, you can't even create terrorist attacks this game petty thief."
Do right. By right I mean apocalypse cars.
you will have to fight mod menu using kids for certain unless you only play private lobbies
aba
i hate this game. best game ive played ngl
GTA 6 will come out in 2026
"It is no longer recommended for any player to play GTAOL to buy this game. Its life cycle is basically at the end, and the only thing left is lingering and more garbage content. We gave Rockstar a couple of year to improve this game, and his updated content is getting more and more worse. Here is why I don't recommend anyone to buy GTAOL anymore. · Extremely worst online environment If you go to a public session, that is, a session where a group of stranger players are together, there is a high probability that someone will cheat. Even if you hide, you will easily encounter cheats such as teleport all players to a cage to kill you. You will also be unable to press the game menu due to repeated killings. And if you want to play as in private, you can avoid it, but the premise is that you are not targeted by any cheats, otherwise the cheats will always join your session or mission, and then continue to send you to the cage to kill, or crash your game. Even if you never mess with any cheaters, you will encounter ballstorture random invitations (indiscriminate invitations that last for a year, and even forcefully pull players into new sessions) And what’s Rockstar do anything about this? They just simply disabled the function for players to invite public players from private sessions to play missions together. At the same time, players can no longer search for missions enabled in different sessions (it was possible before this update), so players have made so many sacrifices, presumably the problem of cheating has been well improved! As a result, at least million cheats that invite harassment and attack players indiscriminately across the server can be found on the internet everywhere, 1/4 of which is ballstorture! ! ! This is their attitude towards cheating! ! ! They don't even care about cheats that affect the overall situation, and the rest of the minor troublemakers are out of their control. · Extreme disgusting update content If the extremely disgusting environment can be avoided by relying on absolute isolation, then the remaining big problem that you absolutely cannot avoid is the update content that is getting more and more disgusting. If it is said that last summer’s ULP series mission update, there are at least some additional content to praise (hidden contacts, auto store classification options, yes, they dragged it out for almost 10 years), but this year there is almost nothing to praise! The Worst Jobs of Los Santos Drug Wars, It's perfunctory like taking out some small Job separately, and then telling us that this is a big update? Players who may have never played before don’t know what the concept of the usual major task update is. If you don’t consider the update of PVP content, the previous task update is generally Apartment heist, Doomsday heist (the coolest and most sci-fi), Diamond Casino heist, and large-scale heist missions such as Cayo Perico heist. Apartment heist is the number one benchmark in the 4-player cooperation series. It can sneak in or force a sudden attack, and there are many ways to play. And hallucinogens even scored chapters and chapters, and the next chapter was delayed for almost half a year, and even a difficult mode (that is, the chance of resurrection was reduced) had to be squeezed out for several months! Such efficiency is unprecedented and outrageous. Maybe it’s okay to play these trash mission, and you can play some other stuff in the game(such as race or sth), then the next content is definitely the most disgusting. · Extreme disgusting operation mode Grand Theft Auto, charges related to car theft, right? the focus is on stealing and cars, Auto! ! ! In their latest update, they deleted nearly 200 cars! And that number is still growing! What is the reason given by Rockstar? ""Lesser-used vehicles will be removed from in-game websites to streamline the browsing experience"", so, Rockstar must be very concerned about the player's browsing experience, right? Oh, in addition to deleting nearly 200 cars, it is just adding a few categories, and then? Is there a search by name? Are there more filter rules? After viewing a car's introduction, can I stay at the last browsed position when going back to the previous page instead of browsing from the beginning? nothing! A flying motorcycle of 2 million, they increased it to EIGHT MILLION after several price increases, which is equivalent to do The Cayo Perico Heist at least 5 times in a row, and each time it has to be a profit of 1.8 million (equivalent to a single person's exclusive bonus + door glitch + good luck to get the highest value goods enough to fill the backpack), you can afford this vehicle, if you are not so lucky, you have to do The Cayo Perico Heist more times! At the same time, I don’t know what happening with Rockstar. They often launch various garbage missions. Not only are the rewards not good, but the missions are also not good. For example, the last Halloween was limited to collect 200 jack-o’-lanterns for a week, with random effects such as explosions and electric shocks, or collect 100 props. This way of creating ""out of print"" is very disgusting. In order to add a little collection value to their perfunctory clothes, they engage in this kind of disgusting time-limited collection. Whoever does it will be disgusted. They forcefully reflect the difficulty of collecting this piece of clothing to add so-called value. However, I still can't wear it in the mission, which is amazing. There is also the mission editor. They have more and more restrictions on the mission editor. Recently, they even added an item blacklist, which made most of the interesting player-made maps unplayable,Although he was scolded back, no one can guarantee when he will delete it again. In addition, it also limits the player's earning speed. The most profitable Cayo Perico has added a 3-hour CD for single-player clearance and a 48-minute CD for multi-player clearance. Other large-scale jobs have also added a 48-minute CD (mandatory multiplayer). Before the player has fully played, some people may think that limiting the earning speed can allow the player to experience this growth process. However, when faced with a broken gun worth hundreds of thousands (more expensive than many real estates), most people will not dislike the short CD, but only complain about the abnormal inflation in Los Santos. After all, rockstar knows that it is too easy for players to make money and buy things, so they will not buy its GTA+ members and shark cards. · Endless glitches and crashes Various benign glitches in this game help players make more money in jobs. Vicious glitches such as decrease bullets cause players to lose hundreds of thousands of ammunition costs in vain every time, and even game crash and decrease revenue. Rockstar will only repair the former, and the latter is basically left to the community. Fun glitches get fixed, and annoying glitches pile up, never really getting fixed. Such a worse and disgusting online environment is the only one among so many open worlds, and it is getting more and more worse and disgusting! And you know what? I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of content is exclusive to GTA+ members a year from now, especially the 200+ cars that got deleted, because that's something that Rockstar would come up with!"
Game play and storyline was great
solid game tbh
ya good ensfnsdf
"its SUPER realistic and fun to play though i do wish there were more heists and you could steal more things during missions, its still very fun."
muito bom da pra matar gordo e veia
I LOVE THE STRIP CLUB
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
ths good] g a m e
One of my all time favourite games I have ever played.l
i dont even own it
whats there to say? Do whatever you want
DWQ
Good Times
its a fun online game
Its a Hate and love game...   But at its current state I cant recommend it. Every multiplayer lobby has at least 1 hacker/cheater in it. Very sad people. With the emphasis on AT LEAST.
I'm hungry
mum
"It's good, GTA IV is better though."
I love getting hookers and driving them off the pier....
i like it picasso
fun to mess around and do heists and missions although it is pretty hard to progress through the game
"Finally, a game were I can live out my deepest fantasies. Like driving between the lines and listening to the radio WITHOUT paying for gas or being able to afford a house."
so i started the game and went right into a public server good idea i was trying to rob a store and a random person come up help me will the game all control how to make money then says we are the only people in here you got a 10 car garage and then gave me 10 duloxos it was a nice start and if you are a modder as well you should go help a new player.
it is not worth buying because after i ha dent played GTA for a while it said that i had to reinstall the game when i had it installed and had a mager bug i would not recommend to buy the game I rate it a 3.5 out of 10
its GTA what else needs to be said.
Very cool game but they should release GTA6
this game is mostly for streamers its what a lot of people want right now so its easy to get into the Youtube or twitch and make money from playing a video game and have fun at the same time
w game just the hackers who spam suck
its gta :)
00000000000000000000000000000000000000000
i like that it's gta 5
rockstar please abandon this game and update rdo
It's GTA what to say
It's pretty good im honest.
W game but wouldn't get it if your brand new cause gta 6 coming out prolly next year
hey look its that game from 2003 that keeps getting updated
fix the faggot ass bitch ass hoe ass modders
good times
"After a long 2-3 hours of wait of download ready to play the game, I ended up in the ''Sign in'' part. Ok, sure why not, I told myself. Signing up my account but then just to be rejected because the account is apparently already linked to their damn social party or whatever that thing is. I did not try to even understand or gave it a second what that second verification was about, clearly had a rough day already and I am not gonna spend 15 minutes trying to figure out why or why not this account is not eligible. Like literally, why do we even need theses to play GTA V on solo/story mode. What are they trying to protect from it via the use of emails or whatever their social group is, I just wanna play the game like any other, just click and play why does it have to be that complicated for something that is not even multiplayer god damn.. (There is multiplayer but I just went for the normal story mode one) Although the game is good, I've played it on my ps4, hopping that I could just play on my computer for 2 hours just to chill. Man it was good time when the Ps3 was out, there was no accounts or such things as gamepasses. Everything was just given in the game since there was no way to put money into it."
I Dnt knw why but Game is crashing too much when playing online.
this game is so good but dont buy it wait for grand theft auto 6
once you get into the game it might seem boring at first but when you really get into seeing what this game is all about you'll be playing for hours
it get update and new content so that cool
i like throwing c4 at the strippers instead of money
way better on pc then other and that you can type in chat
"Timeless and exceptional, GTA V continues to captivate players even a decade after its release. Its vast open world, engaging storylines, and endless opportunities for mayhem make it an undeniable classic. While we eagerly await the potential arrival of GTA VI, we recommend diving into the immersive world of Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) to satiate your appetite for adventure. However, it's worth acknowledging that some players have expressed concerns about Rockstar's monetization practices, which may leave a bitter taste for some. Nevertheless, GTA V remains a must-play experience for any gaming enthusiast."
is a really nice game when you play with 2 Fps on a shit computer
ehh
aaaaaa
best game ever seen  'die heart fan
I like this game its very fun.

"stop working on this game and start working on your other game you idiots, tbh I want rdr3 more than i want gta 6 though. jk"

"Hop out the Scat', where my shooters at? Guess they running late All my opps probably smoking rocks so I got time to waste Picked up my pace, 'cause I saw a shop ten feet down the block (obvi) He ain't got a lock, so I walk into it, then I saw the ball (grah, grah) And he like, ""Hi, how's your day?"" I said, ""I'm doing great"" (hi) Then I upped it at his face and I said, ""Open up that case"" (open up that case) I took a chain, bust-down pendant too, depending on my mood (grah) I need to run, but the final shot, I only got one too (Get out my way) Then I saw twelve, Dusty rang my bell He said, ""What's the move?"" (What's the move?) I said, ""I'm doomed"" 'Cause the cops just said that if I move, they shoot Said, ""You a fool"" (If you got the jewels, then I'll be there at 2) Now I'm pacing, and my heart is racing, don't know what to do (what do I do?) I'm acting cool, drippy like a pool, waiting for the goons (grah) Then I seen 05 let off two, we starting racing with the loot (we off the shit)"

"GTA 5 is when, after a 2 hour jailbreak, someone failed to open their parachute. GTA 5 is when you have one eye on the road and the other on the subtitles. GTA 5 is when the game gives you more fps than some older games. GTA 5 is when you can jump on a skyscraper on your bike. GTA 5 is when your tank flies into space from touching a wall with its muzzle. GTA 5 is when wooden poles are stronger than iron ones. GTA 5 is when your helicopter can kill you even after you jump out of it. GTA 5 is Trevor in a woman's dress. GTA 5 is when the police crash into you and start shooting you for it. GTA 5 is when a game doesn't get boring after thousands of hours. GTA 5 is when you have exams, but double experience. GTA 5 is the best $30 investment you can make."
may the best cheat wins. zzzZz.
love game i love crash my friend
no.
I Have Realized That Rockstar Needs To Fix A Lot Of Stuff Like Making The Opperser Not In Freemode Or Make It Not Have Weapons
Very fun to play with friends but the grinding kills me.

"Rockstar just removed nearly 200 cars from the stores, so new player can't get them normally, except the lucky wheel which is very rare. this both made good lucky wheel cars very rare, but also blocking some more competitive cars behind a paywall. If it really was about ""streamlining"" the experience, many have pointed out that they simply could have added a filter function to the in-game sites for particular classes  overall just a dick move from the game company."
this is a good game bro
Lovely Game :)
"Well what else do I even need to say it's GTA 5 so yeah this game is dope asf, play it and experience it yourslef."

"Even though I have substantially more hours than what's on my steam due to the fact I've played it most on ps3 and xbox one, I am sitting here writing my dead to right honest review of GTA 5. Although the overall gameplay experience will change as you go from story mode to online play, it is a solid experience. Graphics are smooth and stutter free and quite stunning if you're playing on the highest possible settings, it is quite enjoyable even if you have to settle with lower graphics. I myself am playing on the highest possible settings with my ASUS TUF gaming laptop, it has NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1650 graphics card and AMD Ryzen 5 4600H processor and 32 GB ram (aftermarket custom job as the laptop orginally only has 8GB, but upgrade was nessecary to play newer games without issues) so if you have a computer, either a tower or laptop with similar or higher specs - you are more than capable of playing GTA 5 and enjoying the experience as you go along. Story is detailed and rich in different ways you can take to reach the same goal, added bonus is that you have three characters to choose from and 3 different endings of story mode when you get that far. Loads of possibilities as in how you play the game and spend your time, if you either want to go full sandbox and stunt cars, planes, helicopters or a BMX bite along the mountain side - litteraly only thing stopping you is your own imagination same goes with online play - wanna go full rampage mode, or settle down with owning businesses and earning big bucks by owning a night club etc, the choice is yours. But, there is a big but here. Online play can be good and it can be just as bad, lots of toxic players and just the same amount of hackers and cheaters. However, there is a work around to play online mode and not being lobbied with tons of these by using the resource monitor methode (use google and watch how it is done) I myself am fond of that and have been enjoying online play even more ever since I found out about that. The game is full of surprises and as said earlier, the only thing stopping you is your own imagination. Theres a million different ways to play and if you like the game as much as I have, you will loose lots of hours on it. Bon voyage and enjoy."
"10/10 Got this game before the release of GTA 6 to fell it out while it was on steam sale this became easily one of my most favorite games, the game looks great even though it was released about 10 years ago, the main story is good and the 100% is enjoyable. However the best part of the game is the simple act of CARS driving and customizing them is the greatest I have ever played with"
"after 550 hours, i can confidently say, its okay"
good but alot of modders
The game is pretty nice but i prefer Red Dead Redemtion 2
i purchased the game but it syas no licenses also there  is no play button only purchase and i have proof of purchase so please help me
its very fun 100% recommend
one of the best games on steam and just in general.

"Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece of open-world gaming, showcasing Rockstar Games' unparalleled ability to create immersive, exhilarating, and sometimes controversial experiences. Released years ago, it remains an enduring classic that has stood the test of time, captivating players with its dynamic storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and endless possibilities for chaotic fun.  The narrative of Grand Theft Auto V revolves around three distinct protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber living a life of luxury; Franklin, a street-smart hustler eager for bigger opportunities; and Trevor, an unhinged, psychopathic criminal with a penchant for chaos. Their lives intertwine in a gripping tale of heists, betrayal, and self-discovery, drawing players deep into the dark underbelly of Los Santos.  From the moment you set foot in the sprawling city of Los Santos, it becomes apparent that Rockstar has spared no expense in crafting a visually stunning world. The attention to detail is unparalleled, with bustling streets, picturesque landscapes, and vibrant characters breathing life into every corner of the game. The level of realism is astonishing, making you feel like you're an active participant in a living, breathing metropolis.  One of the key highlights of Grand Theft Auto V is its immense open-world freedom. Players are presented with a vast playground where they can engage in an assortment of activities, ranging from adrenaline-pumping heists and high-speed police chases to more casual endeavors like golf, tennis, and stock market trading. The plethora of side missions and mini-games keeps players entertained for hours on end.  The humor and satire embedded in the game's dialogue and radio stations add a layer of wit and charm to the experience. Rockstar's ability to mock various aspects of modern society, politics, and popular culture in an entertaining way is commendable, albeit often controversial.  However, it's worth noting that Grand Theft Auto V is rated M for Mature for a reason. The game is not suitable for younger audiences due to its intense violence, explicit language, and adult themes. Parents should exercise caution and be mindful of the game's content.  Despite its brilliance, the game is not without some minor flaws. The occasional mission difficulty spikes and overly aggressive police AI can be frustrating, but they hardly detract from the overall enjoyment.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains a landmark in gaming history, setting a standard for open-world games that few have matched. Its engrossing narrative, impeccable graphics, and an abundance of activities make it an unforgettable experience. If you have the stomach for mature content and are eager to explore a virtual world like no other, Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute must-play."
its sick
love this game but need more motorcycles
very cool 11/9
It's so much fun to just see what GTA offer's
is a good game but im stuck on 37% and theres no mission i called every character using all 3 of them checked every mail if someone know how to help
it fun to chase down other players and then scream the house down when karma smacks me
Super Fun Definitely Buy This Game
"It's not as good as I expected. The cars handle poorly and so do the characters on foot. It takes way too much space on the hard drive, and won't work without a designated launcher. Even many years after the premiere it's still very buggy, cars disappear from the garage, characters glitch through the floor and camera tends to clip through walls. The environments are pretty bland, especially the city. Things that deserve praise: the game is pretty easy, it runs smooth, the graphics are nice, and it's compatible with Windows 10. Overall it's missing a lot of charm that previous games in the series had, but it's a decent driving simulator. Update: There's lots of fun mods to improve the game! That makes it worth it!"
very nice game do recommend highly
i played it little and i think its good i played online more than story mode story mode done btw go down                                             s3x is good

"Grand Theft Auto V: Where traffic rules are suggestions, chaos is a lifestyle, and jaywalking is an extreme sport. Buckle up for a joyride of mayhem and mischief, with more stolen cars than a kid's toy box. Trevor, the poster boy for ""What in the world?!"" moments, steals the show with his unique brand of crazy. If life gives you lemons, Michael, Franklin, and Trevor will probably hijack a fruit truck. Welcome to Los Santos, where pedestrians have the agility of Olympic sprinters and the driving skills of... well, toddlers. It's a game that proves mayhem and laughter go hand in hand, one stolen taco truck at a time!"
my only discontent with this game is that the server crashes a lot

"I don't have much playtime on PC, but I've 100% the game on 3 generations of Xbox. It would take wayyyyy more words than this review box will allow for me to explain how great this game is, so I'll just say it's one you should absolutely experience, and if you're curious about the people behind the GTA series, checkout ""Jacked"" by David Kushner."

THE BEST GAME EVER FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO DO.  NOT BORING AND JUST LIKE IN A REAL WORLD. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  KUDOS ROCK STAR YUH HOOO! ! !
"good story. GTA online is being ruined by modders. Everything online is expensive and requires massive grind to own decent buildings, vehicles, weapons. Still a fun game, fun driving, shooting, flying. If you haven't bought the game yet, this review will not convince you."

"My note will be, fucking don't play this game.  The online is fucking filled to the brim with cheaters (you litteraly won't have a single session without at least one or two).  The community is terrible and rockstar are fucking sleeping and just waiting for the game to rot."

"GTA V is a game that I've known about since it launched but I haven't really been able to play it until around 3 years ago when I got it on console. After buying it for PC and playing through single player again this is what I have to say. The main storyline is fairly solid though a bit convoluted and has a lot going on which is kind of expected when there are 3 main protagonists. Although it's still fun, engaging, and worth your time in my opinion. The online mode on the other hand is a bit of a shitshow. For one, it's very grindy as the payouts for missions and business sales are very low compared to the vehicle and property prices. Another issue is modders who can either ruin your session or lead to a lot of silliness and fun times, and there's almost no inbetween. And with a recent update, Rockstar removed around 180 vehicles from the websites. For reference, the game had somewhere around 700 vehicles before the update. That aside, there are some fun things you can do like rob stores, play PvP, mess around with your friends or random people, etc. All said, this game still holds up pretty well nearly 10 years on and I think it's worth the money especially if you get in on sale."
i love this game mostly for five m
story mode on top 50% of online players are modders
Singleplayer is alright. Online is dogshit! Toxic community wouldn't even let a level 3 do anything! They just repeatedly kill you over and over till you uninstall! The passive mode in RDRO is 1000x better then this trash!
F*CK GTA AND F*CK ROCKSTAR LET THIS GAME DIE
Yes. Specific brain usage needed
"In hindsight the story isn't all that memorable, IV is definitely the better game and the 3d trilogy certainly have better stories and settings, they just kinda play like dogballs. In summation; GTA 5 is ok, I wouldn't spend more than like $15 probably."
i like becuz of bar i can see tits
the bes game
good game but still laggy

"Chilli con carne recipe  if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Chilli con carne recipe you've come to the right place,  Ingredients  1 large onion 1 red pepper 2 garlic cloves 1 tbsp oil 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder (or 1 level tbsp if you only have mild)  1 tsp paprika 1 tsp ground cumin 500g lean minced beef 1 beef stock cube 400g can chopped tomatoes ½ tsp dried marjoram 1 tsp sugar (or add a thumbnail-sized piece of dark chocolate along with the beans instead, see tip)  2 tbsp tomato purée 410g can red kidney beans plain boiled long grain rice, to serve soured cream, to serve  Directions  STEP 1 Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.  STEP 2 Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.  STEP 3 Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).  STEP 4 Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.  STEP 5 Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.  STEP 6 Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  STEP 7 Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.  STEP 8 Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.  STEP 9 Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.   info. This great chilli recipe has to be one of the best dishes to serve to friends for a casual get-together. An easy sharing favourite that uses up storecupboard ingredients. it's also freezable"

"This game is gas in a can. Like the good kind. I will say that playing online is a bit toxic, but going into passive mode or crew session relieves that."
"GTA Story Mode: Bunch of extra things you can do, but mainly gets boring after you complete the story. You can go 100% and get all the objectives on missions, but with the checkpoints denying objectives, among other things making 100%'ing pretty titedous.  GTA Online: More fun to play alone when wanting cash, less fun to mess with other players, very fun to play with friends.  Mods: FiveM, LSPDFR, they are a good reason to get this game, but maybe for the game to be on sale.  Overall: GTA is pretty cool, but has it's weakspots."
Problem open'
this game reminds me of GTA V
Game worked fine until Rockstar insisted that their launcher be open and running to play the game I bought on steam.   Now I need to troubleshoot it everytime. Garbage.

"this game is 100% malware once you get online, peer to peer servers let hackers do whatever they want to you and your pc and theres nothing rockstar can or will do about it. if you want to play a rockstar game online just get a console version, they can do scripts but they cant do the various bullshit with menus they do on here. honestly kind of insane that this game doesnt have any way to protect you, and also forces you to do open world missions with these people in every damn lobby"

"Grand Theft Auto V had the potential to be an exhilarating gaming experience, like it was on previous gen game consoles, but my personal encounter left me disappointed. The unjustified ban I received without any reason was a major setback, making me question the integrity of the game's online system. Moreover, the pervasive pay-to-win elements within the game detracted from its overall enjoyment. Regrettably, these factors overshadowed the game's potential for greatness."

FYE GAME CANT WAIT FOR GTA VI
//////
i mean what can i say
very very gooood
i do enjoy the game but it crashes non stop they need to fix it
"someone in the community hacked my game now it is linked to another email. i cannot change this email as i have no access to the email of the hacker meaning i cannot verify my request, the support on the website is shit with no interaction actual humans meaning it takes to long to wait between stages. i would forgive this if it was an interesting game but it is not. 1/10"
"Immersive gameplay, great story, and great performance on low-end hardware... All of these suddenly collapsed on GTA Online.  Terrible performance, fills with hacks, hacker spam DMs, and so-so gameplay. Feels like worse chat room and mini game player than actual RP games."
Best game in the world.
"Its fun, playing it all day"
poep
recommend. just hide the loading screen from ur parents fr
TRUMPS UP although game is old but graphics are still  better then most of game plus smooth but need little work on online server because of glitchs
i luv it open world god
"I have played this game over and over. Driving, flying, stealth, shooting and feeling like you can live another life is highly entertaining, the online co-op is fantastic and the developers occasionally adding new content keeps it fresh.  Although I am not a fan of profanity and sexual content, the game is full with a lot more than that which makes it a super fun experience for me.  Thank goodness this game was made when it was because at least you don't need a supercomputer to run it like RDR2."
"I was scared of dentists and the dark I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations Oh, all my friends are turning green You're the magician's assistant in their dream Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-ah-ah And they come unstuck Lady, running down to the riptide Taken away to the dark side I wanna be your left-hand man I love you when you're singing that song And I got a lump in my throat 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong There's this movie that I think you'll like This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City This cowboy's running from himself And she's been living on the highest shelf Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ahh-oh And they come unstuck Lady, running down to the riptide Taken away to the dark side I wanna be your left-hand man I love you when you're singing that song And I got a lump in my throat 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong I just wanna, I just wanna know If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay I just gotta, I just gotta know I can't have it, I can't have it any other way I swear she's destined for the screen Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh Lady, running down to the riptide Taken away to the dark side I wanna be your left-hand man I love you when you're singing that song And I got a lump in my throat 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong Oh lady, running down to the riptide Taken away to the dark side I wanna be your left-hand man I love you when you're singing that song And I got a lump in my throat 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong Oh lady, running down to the riptide Taken away to the dark side I wanna be your left-hand man I love you when you're singing that song And I got a lump in my throat 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong Yeah, I got a lump in my throat 'Cause you're gonna sing the words wrong"

MANTAP BANYAK HACKER
"I hate to give it a bad review but all it seems to do is crash and bug out, plus all the GTA Online players are sweat lords. I keep getting the glitchy sound so it just cuts out randomly just crashes. The cheaters are awful just now I got killed by a man with infinite health hacks and speed. Plus he was trying to get me banned by putting my RP at 8000 even tho i'm only level 21. Please fix RockStar,"

"Grand Theft Auto V is the best action-adventure game published by Rockstar Games. It was released on September 17, 2013 But still I'm playing this game in 2023. Overall, Grand Theft Auto V is an excellent game that is sure to entertain players of all ages. It is a must-play for anyone who enjoys open-world action-adventure games. I like the story mode of this game. Graphics Quality of this game is Next-level. I can drive any car is the main reason why I love Grand Theft Auto V!"

"ever since i was 7, ive wanted to be a taxi driver more than anything. GTAV has been the only game that fulfills my dream. theres also gun or whatever"
Would recommend using mods or playing Online
the story is really good and fun. however i do not recommend playing online as it would just get boring after a while. other than that if you want a good story then buy this but if your looking for a good online experience i would suggest playing other games with multiplayer that are actually better than gta online
Rocksstar Games is a joke and the online version of GTA Online is absolute garbage.

my janky ass cumpooter runs this game
"[url=https://ultracore.eu/users/M4573RM1ND/gtasultanmeme001.png][/url] Yeeah, so how did this happen huh?  Also, thanks for update that removed loads of vehicles from game just a bit after my game crashed and my main character was resetted. As i contacted support they simply said they don't make backups of those. Now imagine losing character over 500 levels with all garages almost full of vehicles, not to mention bunkers, facilities, airports, drug lockups, guns, nightclub and of course the damn time that went to achieve all that.  As of that, i will never again buy any Rockstar games."
But My ID IS BANNNNNN PLZ SORRY plz me UNBAN
fajna gra bardzo polecam oraz można grać ze znajomymi

dobra igraja na leba da je mazes
"Wow writing a Steam review for GTA V in 2023, somethings never change. Well I've been playing this since it came out and online didn't even exist. Lets talk post release shall we, Online has been a major success the story is just a faster way to load into the game now sorta. Lets talk about the goods, since release of online play there's been so much added from property and vehicles to the actual content and missions even just customizing your character and running business's like some sort of tycoon lots to come back for every so often. Unfortunately every good comes with a bad, from missions lagging out or your game just all out disconnecting and kicking you out to stare at steam library stage. I have even had missions all out not pay me after completing the objectives. This is especially annoying because everything in this game is so damn expensive and I cant for any reason understand why. For any new car you'll need to complete at least 2 heists to afford it and that's assuming everyone's either down to not get paid more or down to give you more money than the other 3 members. I'm of course talking about the 3 other people you're doing a heist with. Unfortunately hackers and modders are the real troopers keeping this game alive, almost every lobby you join will have at least one. Normally you just have to wait out 20 minutes of them murdering you and sweet talk them in public chat and they'll give ya a hand out or at least let you ride around in their modded vehicle wreaking havoc. Anyways having spent the past 2 weeks just really grinding out this game in slew of excitement for the GTA VI announcement trailer I find myself enjoying the game a lot."
Never gets OLD!
Yes    balls
"GTA 5 Online is Pay to play(Game isn't free), Pay to win(Buy whatever you want with Shark cards, in game currency) and Subscribe to win(GTA+). Online is no longer fun to play. Story mode is the only good thing game has unfortunately."
this game kinda mid ngl edit: i finally robbed enough stores to finally buy the kosatka cant wait to make money!
bad game fun as hell tho
cost  to much

"Fun. Lots of vehicles to drive, lots of stuff to do. A staple of gaming."
very fun to crap on little kids and talk abou there moms
"Still the gold standard, both for a live-service multiplayer game, and for an open-world story experience. A must buy, even in the second half of 2023."
gta is 2 silly
over 10 years still one of the most played online games with added content. Its not great content but its still kept up pretty well

GOOFY ASS GAME
They made it so you can do everything in private lobbies. I just wish I could transfer my Xbox character. I just wish they also added the PS5 and XSX content to PC too.
It is just so entertaining and cures boredom and sometimes anger
top tier
"游戏好玩，整体体验良好，但是反外挂很鸡肋。 The game is good, and the overall experience is also well, but the anti-cheating is rather lackluster."
Single player campaign is amazing but the multiplayer is full of hackers and game consistently crashes.

rockstar support is fucking useless this game will hardly run on their launcher
i like george
i love killing the npcs
"First 5 minutes online and I can't even make a character because some idiot decided to troll by somehow parking a car upside down in the same spot where the character is created, making it impossible to see.  The trolling is so stupidly high that you can't even get into the game. RIP GTA5 Online because your system is a complete joke as is your business practices if you can't even keep such a stupid thing from happening.  Really though don't expect help either. Rockstar support is non-existent. I know the game is old but really? Korean games have better quality support and that's saying something."
bro cool
COMMON SHOOT PEOPLE AND ROB F*CKERS NOTHING BETTER!!!
Keeps crashing on loading screen. Greatest game ever :)
"very fun game would recommend to any avid anarchist, criminal, or psychopath."
"Rockstar has ruined their own game with greed & exclusive updates for console. Every step of the way they make it difficult for users. There is no excuse for the lack of cross platform, or original character migration from console. Removing cars from the in-game websites to repackage later as ""New"". Weak security measures on Social Club. The list could go on."
its a fucking good game
ts giving

too much nudity
It's GTA yall.
"Super laggy and constantly getting kicked out of the game, which is very annoying. But fun concept."
I hate opressor mk2
"Fun game to play, just annoying to deal w hackers/scripters T-T and like high level people who constantly shoots down low level players. I recommend using invite only session if u wanna grind solo and away from annoying people :> and if u do go on a public session, passive mode is your best friend, if not fight back as well >:D ."
Fun very
Yes BUT there are alot of hackers that make the game a bit less fun SOME Hackers just mess about and make the game fun
still a garbage game. During swimming says use L1 to swim even tho  I'm using keyboard............An absolute garbage.
In 2013 this game was great. Now its a painful shell of its former self.   Single player is fine but online is an absolute overpriced microtransaction  nightmare.  Do not buy this game in 2023. Rockstar nor Take2 should keep shilling this dogwater ten years later. They need to make new games and not just a new GTA.
VERY GOOD GAME  XD
ssssssssssssssssssssssss
my mod menu works great
not that bad :)
I personally love playing the game. But its more fun for fivem
mkk
YES YES VERY GOOD YES YES
this is one of the best games of all time
"What do i have to say. Well, this is the old and good GTA 5 that you alr know."
"I spent all my money I got from the starter bundle for online, I am now dirt poor and cant get money 😭"
Recommended !
Dont play over rated
"i like being tortred by motorcycle-riding, flying, godlike, and tryharding players when playing online and trying to secure a stash"
what can i say this game is just amazing.
toxic game don't play it
FUCK YEA
GTA V History = GOAT  GTA V Online requirements -> play with 3 or more friends = GOAT
guns and naked women
"GTA 5, also known as ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" is not just a game; it's a wild rollercoaster ride through the world of crime and mayhem, with a dash of hilarity thrown in for good measure. If you've ever wanted to live out your wildest criminal fantasies without any real-life consequences, this game is your golden ticket. But beware, because chaos and comedy go hand in hand in Los Santos.  First off, let's talk about the characters. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin form a trio that's as dysfunctional as a broken joystick. Michael is the retired bank robber with family issues, Trevor is the psychopath with a twisted sense of humor, and Franklin is just trying to make a name for himself. Their interactions are like a never-ending episode of a crime-based sitcom, and their banter will have you laughing out loud between heists.  But it's not just the characters that bring the comedy gold. The open-world environment of Los Santos is an absolute playground for the mischievous. You can steal cars, run over pedestrians, cause massive explosions, and even go skydiving while dressed as a chicken. Yes, you read that right. The sheer absurdity of the side activities and random encounters is worth the price of admission alone.  And let's not forget about the radio stations. Whether you're cruising in a stolen sports car or evading the cops, the radio will never let you down. The satirical talk shows, ridiculous commercials, and catchy tunes make driving around the city an absolute joy. I've lost count of how many times I've found myself laughing hysterically at the witty commentary or dancing in my chair to some 80s power ballad while being chased by the police.  Of course, there's also the online mode, where you can team up with friends or complete strangers to cause even more chaos together. From crazy races where the laws of physics seem optional to heists that require a level of coordination that's equal parts hilarious and frustrating, it's a multiplayer experience unlike any other.  Now, it's important to mention that GTA 5 isn't just about the laughs. It also boasts a gripping story that delves into the dark underbelly of crime and greed. But let's be real, most of us are here for the wacky shenanigans and the joy of pushing the boundaries of what's possible within the game's virtual world.  In the end, GTA 5 is a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. It embraces the ridiculousness of its own existence and invites players to join in on the fun. If you're looking for a hilarious, action-packed adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end, grab your controller, buckle up, and get ready for a ride that's as crazy as it is unforgettable. Just remember, it's all fun and games until you accidentally run over a cow and end up with a five-star wanted level. Good luck, and enjoy the mayhem!"
I have already played this game on my PS5 but I just still love this game so much. it still fun to play online and the campaign is still amazing. 10/10 perfect.
lester takes all my money
No issues. Works smoothly even on low spec laptop like mine. My only issue is I need to access rockstar games app to play it. That and some online connection issues. Wish GTA SA was still available.
"Servers are filled with moderators, but I love how i make only 1,000 after 3 hours  I can't get back <3"
Do you really need a review?
It's alright i guess but the amount of hackers i get in each game is mind blowing.  I'm just trying to have fun and relax without having to deal with assclowns every online server i join.
4t3qfc dewx
If i could log in i would still give it a bad review
It is a game
pretty good game for how old it is
is cool sometimes
You already know how good it is
IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER
"as good as gta is, dont buy it. Dont support rockstar making dumb decisions, removing content, bringing back content from years ago and branding it as a"" new update"", game is full of hackers, your ip is literally accesible to every 3 year old with a mod menu, plenty of bugs, rockstar does not give a single fuck about its community. Whatever you say, rockstar doesnt care and only does what its investors say.   Dont support rockstar, dont buy gta."
it is fun to play
"This is a very fun game , even in the present"
Best GAME i have ever played in my life
story not to talk about but graphics are great
too many easy hacks
Highly recommend for stress relief.
good game when bored
What can I say.....its GTA MAAAAANNNNN!!! One of my TOP 5 FAVORITE GAMES EVER!!! ACTION!!! DRAMA!!! SUSPENSE!!!  COMEDY!!! STORY!!! ITS GOT IT ALL!!!  5 STARS!!!!!
first time logged in gta online after some time and then i get nuked by 100 players on mk IIs
best game of the century
I love motorbikes with rockets that fly and lock-on to things. Definitely didn't have any impact on GTA online at all
this is honestly the best game ive played
"The best open world game to date.  The world is huge and diverse enough to provide countless hours of entertainment.  The single player story line is magnificent and entertaining. I can't get enough of Trevor.  This is as close to a living, virtual world you can get without jacking in to the Matrix. If you haven't played this, I suggest your crawl out from under your rock and get to it!"
very hard to get a good player when doing diamond casino heist. most of the hiest need to play between 2-4 player. as a solo player it is hard to get a good player because most of the time you will get modder player. who only can using mod. Also you will face many bug when playing gta v online especially when you find a quick job. this problem already appear for a long time but still not fixed by rockstar.
can i marry the prostitutes

Enjoying it thoroughly. Polished game play n worth every penny spent on it. Hail Rockstar⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
so fun no violent at all
oikk
good game its really fun
that is a good game
"Bought it yesterday. Couldnt play because I couldnt redeem the code. This apearantly has to mean you cant even play singleplayer. Doesnt make any sense at all. So you have to create Social Hub Account and all just to play singleplayer. Harrasing ! Cant Redeem code of a game I bought in ! 2023 ! This is crazy ! Asked for a Refund, luckely I got everything back except the few hours of frustration. I think Rockstar is a bad company. Costumers support lacking, and they are SOOO busy, yeah right....."
Damn this game fire as hell...🔥🔥🔥
GTA Online is infested with cheaters and Rockstar doesn't do sh*t about it.
i can go to the shoe shop and raise my wood 10/10
"moved onto PC after having about 1200 hours on xbox. Cool game but holy shit theres so many modders ruining the online experience, luckily theres a way to get into solo public lobbies in online. Otherwise the game would be unplayable"

Online is just a boring mess.

"I may be able to like the game if it worked. From the beginning the game has crashed at random times in different ways (from D3D errors to full computer crashes). I contacted RockStar support, after a couple days I got a canned response which did not help in any way. RockStar Supports website has an issue that does not allow dxdiag or msinfo to be uploaded, though they asked for it. Instead of replying and seeking a solution the best solution was found on the the internet, but it did not fix the issue entirely. RockStar Support has never replied to my open ticket though I have replaied every couple days. 8 days later, the game crashed and is now not loading the title screen at all.  In all the 17 hours I've played there have been a maybe 2 hours playtime before a crash. Some of it was trying to make the game playable but most was trying to play the game only to have it crash on me."
Love the GTA 5 story!
I get to kill people with an mk 2 oppressor
its really frickin pawgerz lulz omegalully :3

"fun to kill people, feels like real life almost."

"I've put 1,000+ hours into this game across 4 platforms. Suffice it to say, this is one of my favorite games of all time."
"Much like Pathologic, or real life, GTA online is an exercise in futility. Took 20 minutes from booting up to joining an online session., I was then repeatedly killed by a hacker, called several slurs by a 13 year old Russian kid, and crashed the game when I tried to report antisemitism in the chat.  10/10 no notes."
If your daily routine is visiting strip club and killing cops This game does give you good practice
"10 year old game, worst support in the business next to EA and systems that were designed in the 90's."
MEOW
to much cheaters
your honour Trevor is not a criminal he is simply redpilled
i shot a woman and a dog!!!

GTA V is one of the best games of all time for sure. Its worth it
Very good and fun
i dont feel like writing
i hit an old lady with a bat
Its a game

good game cuz it has boobies
"Probably one of the few people that bought this game over 7 times, though a few times it was as gifts for others. Anyway, is GTA 5 worth playing in 2023? Even more so with GTA 6 coming around the corner soon? Simple answer my friends: Yes.  ATM, I'd recommend getting the Series X/S versions or the PS5 versions as there's a few features that aren't currently on GTA Online for PC. That said, even having that, I'm still playing this on PC. GTA Online isn't what it was in 2013, and there's more than enough to do if you're wondering about that.  Strongly recommend playing with friends."
"after playing for many years on xbox and now on pc, it is still fun and engaging"

"Grand Theft Auto V, a game that has become a timeless classic, continues to captivate players with its enjoyable gameplay, multiplayer experience, and impressive graphics. As someone who has spent countless hours exploring the streets of Los Santos, I find myself drawn to the fun and immersive world that GTA V offers.  One of the standout aspects of GTA V is its multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online. The ability to join forces with friends and engage in various activities, from heists to races, adds an extra layer of excitement and camaraderie. The multiplayer component has undoubtedly contributed to the game's longevity and replayability.  Visually, GTA V impresses with its detailed and vibrant graphics. The sprawling city of Los Santos comes to life with its bustling streets, breathtaking landscapes, and meticulously designed environments. Rockstar Games' attention to detail is commendable, and it enhances the overall immersive experience of the game.  In terms of storytelling, GTA V initially stood out with its compelling narrative and memorable characters. The intertwining stories of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor offered a diverse perspective and added depth to the game. However, as time has passed, the storytelling has somewhat lost its impact, and it feels like the game could benefit from fresh ideas and a new installment.  Looking ahead, it's clear that the GTA franchise needs to evolve. While GTA V has undoubtedly been a monumental success, the anticipation for GTA 6 and the promise of new and exciting features is growing. Players are eager for Rockstar Games to introduce innovative gameplay mechanics, a captivating storyline, and even more immersive graphics in the next installment.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains an incredibly enjoyable game, particularly when played with friends and taking advantage of the vast multiplayer world. Its stunning graphics and initially compelling storytelling have left a lasting impression. However, as the franchise moves forward, the anticipation for GTA 6 and the hope for fresh experiences and advancements in the series continue to grow."

"I've been only playing the online and holy crap is a clusterduck in the worst sense, this game has been in service for over 10 years, I expected something good but instead you have an online where everyone has ducking cheat menus and who also everyone is just a wanabe buttface, there's ducking inflation in the economic system so you have to grind for days to buy a ducking vehicle, all ducking missions are unstable as ducking duck, the room either dies or the game crashes for some poor soul, you waste all your ducking day preparing some ducking heist which ends up loosing the fun since you've played it a millon duckig times already in the same ducking way, the other ways to get money is with business missions which is the most unfun thing I've ever played in my ducking life  This game is not even fun with friends, is just frustrating is annoying, if you think you deserve some kind of punishment in your life because it's not bad enough, then play the online mode of this ducking game, playing it is like working in a job you ducking hate but you don't want to leave because you got already used to it  I regret wasting my time with this ducking game holy ducking god  Don't make the same mistake as me  Duck..."
"Cmon, its GTA V, how can you give this a bad review"
"Someone else was hacking in the lobby and rockstar banned me after spending about $2,000 prob on the game, but not only that, after buying the game I cant log into my rockstar account because steam is linked to my other account and theres no way of telling which account it is."

"It is not recommended to play online for only two people from the company, the game is designed for 4 people online. For 2+ years, rockstar has not been able to fix the error with Rashkovsky, it is precisely because of him that GTA 5 online ends"
this game committed a warcrime on my storage
"This game is prefect to play with friends,but whatever you do Dont do cargo missions trust me!   Still one of the best games that i have"

funny gangster game 👍
Story is the highlight of the game. Online has become more HACKERS ZONE and is constantly overrun by pay to win bozos and hackers.
"So, You've just got GTA 5. Whats it like you might ask. Well, The story mode is phenomenal and is a breathtaking experience and GTA online is truly a new experience. Whilst it does have its downsides, it is easily made up by sheer amount of quality content in this game. And for that, It deserves a 10"
loved its graphics
best chidhood game
The single player game is fantastic.
"Main Game is worth the price , But multiplayer is not  Due to Decline in players making it impossible to earn cash unless you grind for months    Grand Theft Auto V Main Game:  Grand Theft Auto V, developed by Rockstar Games, is a masterfully crafted open-world action-adventure game that takes players on an unforgettable journey through the crime-ridden streets of Los Santos. Bursting with an immersive narrative, captivating characters, and a vast open world to explore, this game delivers an exceptional single-player experience that truly sets the bar high.  One of the standout features of Grand Theft Auto V is its engaging storyline. The game follows the lives of three distinct protagonists, each with their own quirks, motivations, and gripping story arcs. From the explosive heists to the personal struggles of the characters, the main game weaves a compelling narrative that keeps players hooked from start to finish. The attention to detail in both the dialogue and the environment is staggering, creating an incredibly realistic and immersive world.  The open-world setting of Los Santos is a remarkable feat of game design. From the bustling city streets to the vast countryside, the level of detail and variety is awe-inspiring. Whether you're exploring the urban sprawl or embarking on a scenic drive through the countryside, there's always something to discover or experience. The world feels alive, filled with countless activities, side missions, and secrets to uncover, making every playthrough a unique adventure.  The gameplay mechanics in Grand Theft Auto V are polished and satisfying. Whether you're engaging in intense gunfights, driving high-speed vehicles, or executing meticulously planned heists, the controls feel tight and responsive. The wide range of weapons, vehicles, and customization options further enhance the gameplay, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferences.  Grand Theft Auto V Multiplayer:  While the main game of Grand Theft Auto V shines brightly, the multiplayer component, Grand Theft Auto Online, presents a more mixed experience. While it initially burst onto the scene with immense popularity, it's worth noting that the player count has been dwindling over time.  The multiplayer aspect of Grand Theft Auto V offers a sprawling open world that allows players to engage in various activities with others. From completing missions and heists together to participating in adrenaline-fueled races and competitive challenges, there is no shortage of content to enjoy. The ability to create and customize your own character also adds a personal touch to the experience.  However, the declining player count is an issue that can affect the overall enjoyment of the multiplayer aspect. Finding a full lobby or enough players to engage in certain activities can become increasingly challenging, especially as time goes on. This can result in occasional lulls in the gameplay experience and may limit the opportunities for dynamic interactions with other players.  In addition to the concerns about the dwindling player count in Grand Theft Auto Online, it's important to note that the multiplayer experience also faces criticism for its economy. The in-game currency, GTA$, is notoriously difficult to earn, particularly due to the declining player base. This can lead to frustrating and time-consuming grinding for players who wish to accumulate wealth and purchase desirable items within the game.  To mitigate this issue, Rockstar Games introduced microtransactions that allow players to purchase Shark Cards with real-world money, providing an influx of GTA$ to expedite progress. While this option can be appealing for those looking to bypass the lengthy grind, it has sparked debates about the game's reliance on real-world cash transfers to attain in-game wealth.  The heavy emphasis on microtransactions and the scarcity of in-game currency opportunities can create an imbalance between players who choose to invest real money and those who do not. This monetization strategy has garnered mixed reactions from the player community, with some feeling that it hampers the overall experience and favors players with deeper pockets.  It's important to mention that Grand Theft Auto Online does offer various ways to earn GTA$ through in-game activities, such as heists, missions, and races. However, the challenge of accumulating wealth can be a deterrent for players who seek a more balanced and accessible progression system.  While the multiplayer aspect's reliance on microtransactions and the difficulty in earning in-game currency can be a downside, it's worth noting that the core gameplay mechanics and activities within Grand Theft Auto Online still provide entertainment and opportunities for collaboration with other players.  Overall, the multiplayer component of Grand Theft Auto V, while facing issues of dwindling player count and a challenging economy, still offers engaging gameplay and a platform for cooperative experiences. However, the game would greatly benefit from finding a better balance between real-world cash transfers and in-game progression, ensuring a fair and enjoyable experience for all players, regardless of their financial investments.  Despite this issue, Grand Theft Auto Online still offers a wealth of content for those who can find active lobbies or play with friends. Additionally, Rockstar Games has been known to release regular updates and new content, keeping the multiplayer experience fresh and exciting."
Best game I've ever played. Loading time taken for the online sessions is the only issue that I noticed
The game is fun but there are downsides. Cheater in every session and random crashes when entering buildings. Only playable in closed friend sessions.
You can watch a dog get high on weed.
its justv a fun game in general
Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute blast of chaotic fun! It will keep you entertained for hours.Highly recommended!
I wanted to buy this game for years and now that i have it its a great opportunity for me to play it
Really fun 100% will buy
aaa ea sports its not in the board game

FiveM makes this game worth it.
OMG I never reviewed GTA5! YOU ALREADY KNOOOW
will its good game but i ope they fix lag in menus vsync
shitty devs
Better than GTA 7
Very beautiful and great game 😻
good game i like shooting hookers
Gotta be honest. This is the worst GTA story ever. Trevor is so one-note. Mike is a terrible satire of Tony Soprano. Franklin is the only character worth playing. How many times do we have to have a mission in the same construction site. Yes i know that was 10 years ago. GTA Online is like swatting flies away from a turd pile (the flies being cheaters/exploiters) (the turd being the experience as a whole) I refuse to do three hour prep for a heist that will barely pay for anything.
"alt tabbing during a loading screen takes breaks the game.  Edit loading screens take so long I got kicked for inactivity... IN A LOADING SCREEN. Rockstar games is worth Billions with a B. fix your game you've been milking for a fucking decade.  Edit: Can't do online heists because you need to own something first, whether that be a Hanger bunker or casino. Which cost millions each. But you can't do open world missions/events to earn money because someone who has done every heist and has hundreds of billions will pay to make themselves invisible on the mini map and drone strike you with a flying motor bike or A-10. and the counter to those is a missle launcher that costs $75,000. unless you grind the same mini games that pay $10K or the same DAX missions that pay 20K tops over and over and over until you can afford to buy the prerequisite to play the fucking game, or just pray a modder Tp's the entire lobby into a small area and drops money. Then you are doomed to being bullied by people with no option to fight back. Also 3 fucking minutes before you're kicked for inactivity?? I'm so sorry that I'm taking up valuable space on your servers rockstar games. Ik a small indie company like you is really struggling to keep the servers online. Not like you're worth Billions and make MILLIONS off this game every day, and nearly a billion a year."
"LAUNCHER HAS STOPPED STARTING GTA 5, i can play gta 4 from the ROCKSTAR LAUNCHER  but GTA 5 DOESNT START"

"Circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle…  Three overhead signal sources, three characters where one is able to eclipse another, three mountains, three aligned beacons (fourth is inactive) and only two light sources that intersect one another. Only one time at a bird’s eye angle would one see a flipped side of a triangle. It’s all about taking a look.  Flipped everything would move differently as the days go by, at the second day, at the same time, it would be further than before. Two light sources are both aligned directly from whatever place you draw a line, as in order for one to move, both have to move together. When the dark light falls, the shape that ends at the right destination, this is when the signal is set to active. The signal would be circulating and vibrating differently as you enter a sound zone. Even then, it is hard to communicate. Light sources specifically are not important, what they do at the dotted space is. (Casting a light at an object that casts a dark light.)  An egg that looks like an eye has to rise and stay close at the right source of dark light. (Everything can cast a dark trail) It shouldn’t penetrate the circular hole, instead, it must wait. As one waits, another stands at the square of answers, while another follows a trail of dark light. Only when the air is white can the trail cast strongly and extremely visibly. Think of it as a black square.  And so it is kept. The light source moves accordingly and at a split time shall the signal come to be. (There is another light source where it only starts fading away.) An egg is stationary and it is so. The hole is also stationary and it is so. (Fading away light source is behind you, a light source that is always there emerges itself from the darkness that is light.) An egg shall stay near the hole and so a circle shall cast another circle (hole) right at a dotted space. Then shall you see and hear the answer you were looking for. With all the overhead sources the practice is the same, only one must be aroused near the hole and then, perhaps, it shall go through it.   A circle inside a circle inside a circle is only a circle inside a circle inside a circle where a circle inside a circle inside a circle actually looks to be a circle inside a circle inside a circle. It is a matter of perspective and where a circle inside a circle inside a circle actually is. Where you see a circle inside a circle inside a circle is also important, as largest circle may move and you will miss a time window. When everything is done, when a signal from the hole with an egg near it comes through, at the end shall a harmonic circle where everybody stays appear and cast a relaxing light of pleasure at a plug. A plug is sharp, a plug is the top of a blocky object at the middle. A large hole shall sit down on a plug and lazer beam a big ball and it shall crack. Crawl inside and see the truth. One large ball split in half is actually an entrance. Get in, climb on in. Inside a light of gold everywhere, a majestic light of high performance intensity and at the very middle… Another egg. A big chocolate egg you can eat forever. You can lick an egg with your tongue. You are free to do it slowly, an egg is looked after, it won’t melt. Do it slowly for intense, but prolonged pleasure. Pull out your tongue hard and start sucking. An egg is tasty but…  What about Grand Theft Auto V? Have I liked the game? No. I haven’t either enjoyed or liked the game."
Rampant hacking and crashes frequently
"The campaign is very fun, but many of the side missions are not very appealing. Haven't touched online."
HOTHANDS
got banned :/
too many choco people
your prologue can gently lick some very hairy tree seeds
"Fun to play with friends, other than some hackers are in the game, but thats to be expected in a large online game. Still worth the price."
This game is fun and enjoyable and you can trust me ive played for 108 hours
its freshhhh
best game i love the strip club so much and shagging hoes all day in there with my zesty black cock
good old gta
almost like terrorism
wkwkwkwk
Absolutely would recommend this game. I've only played the story mode so far and will probably update this review when I have more experience but this game is incredible.  Such fun even just to drive around the city and explore. Not for the light-hearted though. There is humor but it's a very harsh game both with violence and sexual themes. Still would recommend.
I like crime
i dont anna play with other players
Its aight. Good game for cheap price.
Its really fun and addicting!
shoot people
This game is really fun and has amazing graphics.
"Great game, even though it was released in 2013, great graphics and storyline."

"GTA V , WOW SO NICE !!"
Literally unless you are under 18 and have strict parents...EVERYONE in the world has played this game. So no need for a review. This is a message for the devs. WE ARE TIRED OF PLAYING THE SAME GAME FOR OVER A DECADE NOW! GTA 6 SOON PLZ!

Story mode is fine. Online is borderline unplayable with all the hackers and modders doing whatever they want without any repercussion.
It is one of the best games i've played
vry goot
L update
absolutely broken but still fun
This rockstar launcher just will not work properly now saying its not linked to the account and i cant play the game i bought with 25hrs of playtime. ridiculous. I will not be buying any more rockstar games on this system i don't need a second job trying to get games to launch when im tired and just want to chill
uhj
The game is definitely a good one to pick up if you're looking for a long well designed story. Other than that the online mode is only good at parts and leads to more anger than enjoyment. The online mode is very grinding based.
fun to smash into people riding motorcycles and bikes (also innocent pedestrians)
very amazing game
gvbv
i bought a megaladon shark bundle and i didnt get the 10 million as promised
"Hackers Theft Auto 5, smh🤦‍♂️"
I tried to run the game but the launcher would freeze. And I may have fixed it a little but now the game launches and exits immediately. I have spent days trying to resolve this issue and my computer is way past the specs requirement. I do not know even how to launch the game.

Its awesome do some assasination type jobs or just rob a jewelery or pretend to be high way patroll just to steal two cars from two little spoiled idiots and then just chill with Treeevaaaa in his hangar preparing to blast another MC club :D  Trevor Philips executive solutions T.P.E.S. Industries providing high quality product and also cater a crack bodyguard team of former special forces. So yes we are in the Empire business tow a car ram a armored car steal jewelery cook the finest meth using strictly Methylamine precursor method P2P and Mr. Phillips is proud to say that there is one kitchen and its toxic fumes are going day and night with the concurency crippled its just a matter of time when T.Phillips executive solutions will be the only viable source of quality and quantity since we almost cancelled every concurention in the region and listen Ex.solutions is killing it and we are not some corner boys either we sell weight in bulk and nobody can say a word so next quartal we are starting to recruit willing mercs who have the skills to guarantee the lab and other infrastructures safety MR. Philips has some business in Los Santos too and while he is there we need a PMC hired former spetznaz mo-sad MI5 MI6 CIA all are welcome to join but we pay fixed monthly provide the weapons but the PMC has to logisticali put a fully loaded body guard we recommend silencer shotguns very discreet has the power to throw a 90kg person on impact to the wall so we have some details to sort and after that we will have a big truck plus a Leopard Tank in case smb would be snitching so we can handle the PoPo´s the 5-O the blue cunts or as I call them thugs with badges with ricens to kill :D Try us I will on the roof the the RPG ready to fuck the chop pa finish  of the rest of the heroes with MG 40 which should dog the shit out of them blue asses fat fucks .... So T.Phillips industries contacts we will be happy to accommodate multiple illicit shit from UNCLE FESTERS COOCK BOOK
This is hot garbage! But I can't stop playing
it have a very good storyline

Oh, better yet, maybe Tanisha'll call your dog-ass if she ever stop fuckin' with that brain surgeon or lawyer she fucking with. Nigga...  (Lamar begins to walk away)  Franklin: What?"

this game is terorist
Game crashed a few times on start up but besides that it's GTA
It's SO FUN!!!
Nothing scarier than Darth Vader appearing everywhere you go exploding every car around you and putting you in a choke hold.
stealing cars
"I played this game for years on console, and just got it for my pc. They have a really good sale right now thats honestly a steal. I pretty much have everything that I had grinded for before without doing it all over again. I recommend not playing on public sessions starting out, there are A LOT of griefers, trolls, and hackers. Do friends only or private. Get FiveM n try some modded/rp servers if your into that. They be super fun"
i dont recommend it because i got 2 pieced by an npc but fun game and i love making realistic gore videos in gta
I guess I've been slowly building my empire so to speak. I recommend the game to anyone who wants to spend one to two hours daily building up your business. It takes a while but when they take off the games gets going.
"Pretty fun until you unlock everything in Online then it becomes very boring, but getting there is a grind but still pretty fun if you have friends"
Michael goes brrrrrrrr
after so many years this game still prevails as one of the best of all time!
i like this game becuse : this game is popular in 2013-2023 and i thailand is liking to play Five M
is trash nobody likes this game gives me depressoibn
700 hours down the drain  fun
I'm not a huge fan of the story mode but online is really good
hyvä peli paljon väkivalta ja muu rikos (rööki=)

I stopped playing for about a year and came back to enjoy the game. Rockstar social club launches and it gives me an error saying the email can't be logged in automatically. I look and the email that I have to use that is connected to the account isn't my email and it's connected to my steam so I can't use another email or even another account. I go to rockstar support and it asks me for information that I don't have access to such as usernames so now I can't play the game. I try playing offline but the game launches then closes even when I set it to story mode only. What a dogshit system.
waaaw
best game of all time story mode is amazing as well
Gta5 is one of the best games i really like so much
It's A Whole Different Game . Still Fire in 2023.
this game is shit this stupied tutorial takes over an hour
LOVE BEATING GIRLS
"Played with friends  Only negatives are: - game is toooo fucken big (50gb? if I remember) - the launcher from rockstar sucks ass (Why? just start the game...) - you need a rockstar ass account (nice, more registering)  Otherwise, recommend the game once you are actually in the game menu."
"It is a really good game, graphics look nice, good story line and nice club :D"

"Waits 10 working days to load in, loads in, 10 year old fetus blows me up in gay flying machine, closes game."
probably one of the worst games I've every played. The excruciatingly long loading screens along with the repetitious bugs and glitches make this game unbearable without friends. -can only speak for GTA Online
some Chinese motherfucker transferred my account to their email. what the fuck.
yurrrr

I only play this on pc for LSPDFR and FiveM however i do really think if your on computer thay you should et this game -i use a gt 710- (aka potato pc)

the strip club and hookers make this game good and the only reason i play it
"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) is a game that's like attending a wedding where everyone's drunk, there's a llama in the punch bowl, and the bride just stole a helicopter. And somehow, that's what makes it absolutely glorious.  In the wide, sun-drenched, bullet-riddled world of Los Santos, you'll experience life as a retired criminal trying to enjoy his golden years. Too bad these golden years involve more high-speed chases, explosions, and questionable life choices than an action movie marathon.  At its core, GTA 5 is about freedom. The freedom to drive like a maniac, to spend your hard-earned (or stolen) cash on military-grade firepower, to run a multi-million dollar criminal enterprise. And let's not forget the freedom to parachute from a plane in a chicken suit, because why not?  Playing as Michael feels like starring in your own reality TV show where you're constantly one step away from a mental breakdown. As Franklin, you're hustling and grinding your way to the top, all while dealing with the most comically dysfunctional friends imaginable. And then there's Trevor... sweet, psychotic Trevor. Spending a day in his shoes is akin to attending a non-stop adrenaline-fueled party at a madhouse.  Despite its age, GTA 5 is still a riotous romp that refuses to age gracefully. It's the party animal who's still chugging shots while everyone else has long since passed out. The graphics still hold up, the soundtrack is eclectic, and the city of Los Santos is as lively and unpredictable as ever.  Is it perfect? Nope. You'll probably end up hammering your keyboard at least once when you fail a mission because you accidentally ran over a pedestrian, got a wanted level, and then were promptly obliterated by the police. But that's all part of the chaotic charm.  n conclusion, if you've ever wanted to experience the thrill of a high-speed police chase from the comfort of your own home, GTA 5 is the game for you. Just remember: in Los Santos, the only rules are the ones you break. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to head back into the game. My pet mountain lion, Mr. Fluffy, gets antsy if I leave him in the car too long. And trust me, you haven't seen chaos until you've seen a bored mountain lion in a virtual city."
good game problem is there are a lot of hackers on online you can play this game on a low end laptop/pc and it will still be able to run fine
idk lol
migrated my Playstation with no warning or information about losing my progress and starting over. fuck you rockstar and take 2 interactive.

Horrible not even a week and some chinese fuck got my social club account
"GTA Online is tons of fun, but the hacker/modder issue is out of control. Modders can mess with you in many ways - force you out of your apartment, bunker, nightclub etc to take out everyone in the session.  Randomly blow you up while you're on missions, or even force your game to crash and kick you from the session.   Overall, I love GTA Online and I've had a lot of fun with it, but the hacker issue is slowly but surely ruining the experience."
use a vpn for protection against modders we can see your ip as easy as clicking on your profile lol
fun with fiveM
"Love this game, but gta online is getting kinda boring right now with the new DLC. Times were better when the diamond casino heist or the cayo perico heist came out. Hell, even the doomsday heist was a great time for gta online! Now its just abunch of futuristic stuff thats ruining the game. Rockstar, please fix! :)"

very good but too much hackers

the best fucking game ever made
dank game

GREAT GAME WORKS GREAT FOR PC
"The game is fun for the most part. If you plan to play offline, sure. Don't play online. Its bad. Like really bad. Almost not worth it at all... just go start a fight on twitter, same basic concept. The online version is barely playable due to trolling. Play something where you don't get griefed 2 mins in because some toddler of an adult can't hack playing a game by the rules. Otherwise the game itself is pretty good."
GREAT GAME...NEED MORE MISSIONS IN THE STORY MODE
This game is GREAT! Even years later im still amazed at how much hard work went into making and keeping this game fun and up to date!
great game just need more players
"Definitely worth it, there are so much content and things you can do"

Always enjoyed this game from the time it released (originally played on Xbox 360) and continued on Xbox One. Just got it for PC a few weeks ago and put in a bunch of hours already.   Works fantastic on PC aside from a few glitches here and there. The draw distance is the best it's been so far on the three consoles I played it on. I especially love that you can do any type of job now on an invite only so I'm not constantly plagued by griefers (which was a problem for almost 9 years).  9/10
family friendly nick eh 30 approved :D
private is fine but public you will all ways find some who's uses mod's
"Lester is an annoying faggot, but i like furry porn so it doesnt really bother me"

"hard to get good at, kids if you are reading this then you should not play this game because it very bad also this game caused me to have depression. recommend this game if you like getting depressed and overworked"
No because  it wont even let me log in the game and my email is verified  and i have the right stream email  It  think im a bot. ANY HELP PLS AND I HAVE 5 HOURS CANT  GET MY REFUND IM MAD  THIS GAME WASTED MY MONEY PLS FIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"This game has been out for years and people still play it to this day. Some people don't even realize how long its been out because this very game could be played on an Xbox 360 and PS3. Another thing is this game still has online stuff and hasn't been shutdown yet due to all the players the game gets daily, sure there are many other games people can play but this one... is just special."
I LIKE TO KILL PEOPLE IN GTA5
I cannot give this game a positive review until Red Dead Online is given some much needed updates.
It stands out even after 10 years of release. I am happy with it. I would appreciate if Rockstar Studios bring the next instalment soon. Waiting for GTA 6 eagerly!
Rockstar removed 180+ Vehicles from the in-game online stores. What the actual fuck.
Love the game!
i bought this then a hacker got into my account and used it all before i even could :D
"one of the best games by far, cant wait for gta 6"
its fun bread
good product
it is funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
good and fun to play with friends.
my boat...
Arson fun and funny :D
theres so much hackers the game is fucking shit
The greatest game I have never actually played.
"This game is one of the greatest masterpieces of our generation. It has complex rpg and teamwork elements, and a captivating and emotional story. The pacing is perfect and there are just enough plot twists to make each one feel meaningful. Furthermore, the puzzles are amazing and scale perfectly. Each one gets you thinking but none are ever so difficult that you have to look it up. Its graphics are stunning and are truly a next gen experience. Even with the amazing graphics it still runs well on almost all computers with high fps.This is the best game to ever come out on steam, and possibly the best video game that has ever been released."
it is prefect
Half fun half really shit (online mostly) Main games decent tho
dagoat
good game worth the payment
yes but my dlc wont fucking download
".kmh,giuuy"
one of the most frustrating things ive ever played

good american good
funny number hehe
"Goated game, will always be one of my favorites, i have bought the game on xbox and playstation. I do wish that you could take one account and move it over so you could keep your progress but it is what it is. I really recommend"
"played a bit on ps4, good game"
its a good game to have fun
"I can't get past the first mission, and I've been trying for some time. The characters just keep yelling at me to take cover and I can't even get into online"
"Gun shooty, car stealy"
"No, I would not recommend this game. Rockstar continues to BREAK the game after 10 years on top of milking the fk out of the money they produce from it. Have an easy way to make money? Nerf. Want to call your car in? Nahhhh we'll break it this update. Wanna enter buildings? Nahhh we'll break that too. Loadings times are still god fking awful, big game or not, I shouldn't have a 9 out of 10 chance to get an infinite loading screen. There are 32 players in every lobby and 16 of them are guaranteed to have Hacks/Mods and no anti-cheat to combat it. We also decided to remove half the content of the game for God knows what reason and it didn't help anything at all. The real question is what baboon did Rockstar hand an IPad to that points at the next dumb idea on it and Rockstar goes *Sure, let's implement that.* ffs do not spend money on this game ever."
It's entertaining!
"Very buggy for a 10 year old game, GTA 6 is gonna be a giant dumpster fire."
THIS IS THE MOST REALISTIC GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. ITS BEEN A DREAM OF  MINE TO PLAY THIS GAME.LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT

"Fun, open world, and just a game to enjoy with friends or just yourself."
"the game is a shit box, cheaters in every other lobby, moders getting impossibly hígh levels and money just so they can bully the low levels, plus rockstar don't do a thing about the wrong stuff only thing they care about is that you cant glitch more money so that you have to buy sharkcards, nothing gets patched faster than money glitches"
jimmy is hot
best game that i ever played
"W game, W mods to the game, W everything about this game. Play it! I've spent more hours on different platforms, so its highly recommended. W"
!!!!
"I personally dislike the story. Not into the whole gangs, drugs, and prostitutes bs. BUT this is a great driving simulator and it was worth every penny. Also a good shooting game and a good online mode. Have had tons of fun with my friends."
muy bueno game my love to casino gambling witch i suck at.
"It's not what is once was. When I first played this game I was completely addicted because of how much fun it was but it no more than a shell of its former self nowdays.. Now it is a broken buggy mess full with cheaters and modders. Even with a high end PC the game will lag me out of heists, selling goods and other prep missions. I do not know if it is a strategy for restricting how fast one can grind money. And dont get me started on the modders. They will ruin the last bit of fun that there was to this game unfortunately."
good game very good for good games
i'm just recomending it lolz
this is not  good i paid 261 kr for premium edition and megaladon cash card and i did not get my megaladon cash card
this game fire cant wait till six
Its gta if you're looking at the reviews you're a dumb fuck what do you expect.
"Grand Theft Auto V is an extraordinary video game that has truly pushed the boundaries of open-world gaming, delivering an unparalleled experience of crime, chaos, and adventure. Developed by Rockstar Games, this masterpiece has captivated millions of players worldwide, including myself, with its stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, and an intricately woven storyline.  From the moment you step foot into the sprawling metropolis of Los Santos, you are instantly transported into a living, breathing world that feels incredibly authentic. The attention to detail is unparalleled, with meticulously designed landscapes, bustling city streets, and a diverse cast of characters that make the game's universe feel vibrant and alive.  One of the standout features of Grand Theft Auto V is its three playable protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking redemption, Franklin, a street-smart hustler looking for a way out of his dead-end life, and Trevor, a volatile psychopath with a penchant for chaos. Each character brings a unique perspective to the game, and their intertwined narratives create a compelling and engaging storyline that keeps you hooked from start to finish.  The gameplay mechanics in GTA V are exceptional, offering a seamless blend of driving, shooting, and exploration. Whether you're engaging in high-speed pursuits, engaging in thrilling heists, or simply wandering the streets causing mayhem, the controls are intuitive and responsive, providing a satisfying sense of control. The ability to switch between characters at any time adds a layer of depth and strategic planning, allowing you to approach missions from different angles.  One cannot discuss Grand Theft Auto V without mentioning its online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online. It is a living, ever-evolving world where players can create their own criminal empire, team up with friends, participate in thrilling missions, and compete in a wide range of activities. The sheer scope of content and the constant updates and additions by Rockstar Games ensure that there is always something new to explore and experience.  Furthermore, the game's soundtrack deserves special praise. From the catchy radio tunes to the atmospheric ambient scores, the music in GTA V perfectly complements the gameplay and helps create an immersive experience.  In terms of graphics, Grand Theft Auto V is a visual marvel. The attention to detail is astonishing, with stunning landscapes, realistic character models, and breathtaking weather effects. The game's ability to maintain a high level of visual fidelity while delivering a vast open world is a testament to the technical prowess of the developers.  Grand Theft Auto V is not without its controversies, as its mature themes and depiction of violence may not be suitable for all players. However, it remains a landmark achievement in the world of gaming, pushing boundaries, and setting new standards for open-world experiences."
Lllllllove this game had it on ps4 and had to buy it on pc i am a big fan of the gta series i mainly play fivem because for some reason my screen goes black when i load base game or ragemp
"Rating: 5/5 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟  Holy guacamole, folks! GTA 5 is an absolute blast and a crime wave of epic proportions. I've never had so much fun breaking the law without facing the consequences... in a video game, of course!  From the moment I fired up the game, I was thrown into a massive sandbox of mischief, complete with a gazillion opportunities to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting citizens of Los Santos. Seriously, it's like the city has an unlimited supply of stolen vehicles, and I'm the Robin Hood of joyriding!  The storyline is wilder than a rodeo on caffeine. I found myself rooting for the three protagonists, Michael, Trevor, and Franklin, even though they're as nutty as a fruitcake. The banter between them had me laughing harder than a hyena on laughing gas. These guys know how to deliver some seriously hilarious dialogue while blowing stuff up!  Speaking of blowing stuff up, the sheer amount of chaos you can unleash in this game is mind-blowing. Need a break from stealing cars? How about skydiving off Mount Chiliad and crashing into a swimming pool? Or maybe you're in the mood to rampage through the city with a rocket launcher, turning everything into a fiery mess? The possibilities are as endless as my cackling laughter while causing mayhem!  And let's not forget about GTA Online, where the real party is at. It's like a never-ending carnival of insanity, with players from all over the world teaming up to pull off heists, race cars, or simply engage in a friendly brawl on the streets. Trust me, the chaos multiplier increases exponentially when you add other players into the mix. It's like a symphony of virtual pandemonium!  Visually, GTA 5 is a stunner. The graphics are so jaw-droppingly gorgeous that I found myself stopping mid-crime spree just to admire the sunsets, the stunning cityscapes, and the mesmerizing details. It's like stepping into a virtual postcard... if that postcard also happened to include explosions and a guy in a chicken suit robbing a convenience store.  All in all, GTA 5 is an absolute gem of a game. It's like a never-ending comedy show with explosions, car chases, and a whole lot of laughs. If you're in the mood for some hilarious, over-the-top action, buckle up and dive into the chaos. Just remember, it's all in good fun, folks. Leave the real-life crime to the fictional pixels!  Disclaimer: No virtual citizens were harmed during my gameplay sessions. Well, maybe a few hundred, but who's counting? It's all part of the fun, right?"
This is the best game i played on pc I Really Love This Game
woman in swim suit 🔥
Its Great story for a game that's 10 years old
Great way to pass the time
"The missions, fighting, and open world is great! But the story is one of the most perfect things I have ever seen. I never thought it would be so flipping GOOD!!! Oh, and the multiplayer is cool too, I guess."
ts lit
"This game sucks, online is constantly patrolled by griefers driving opressor mark twos and deluxos, Rockstar released new content but only for the latest consoles (no pc) and on top of that deleted almost 200 CARS FROM THE IN GAME WEBSITE. Online without a private server is infuriating because you cant go 10 feet without getting blown up. After you beat story mode there is barely anything to do because Rockstar made it so tons of businesses, missions and vehicles are only in online. The only way to get these in story mode is installing mods. Even mods have their problems though. They are a lot harder to install then regular mods because GTA 5 doesn't have a steam workshop, SO EVERY TIME YOU ADD A MOD IT CORRUPTS THE ENTIRE GAME, but then it also starts CRASHING!!!! Regular GTA 5 crashed once every hour for me. I got some mods and then it starts crashing ONCE EVERY 5 MINUTES. It is basically unplayable considering it takes 10 MINUTES TO LOAD BACK IN. The only way I could fix the crashing is to UPGRADE MY RAM TO 32 GIGS TO MAKE A GAME PLAYABLE. This game is garbage and you have two options to play the game after you beat the mediocre story, play online and grind for hours only to get blown up by opressor mark twos, or spend hours manually installing mods only to have the game corrupt and for your hours of hard work to be deleted. I absolutely fucking hate this game, it's shitty online and the lack of a steam workshop.  Update : It got even worse, now I can't even play story mode. I tried it without  mods and with mods and both of them gave me this activation error. I've reinstalled the game multiple times but nothing works, spending hard earned money for a game that doesn't work is crazy."

"i think it was a setup 9/10 +1 for the ""very low"" amount of hackers"
great game with friends
Very interesting and fun game. The only bad thing is the space it takes which is acceptable seeing the graphics. Over all I'd recommend this game to anyone who is wanting to buy it.
Yeah.
mid ngl

great game with nice graphics and realistic story line. one time my mom walked into my room and the screen was trevor philips in his undies. great game overall
i LOVE THIS GAME!!!! 3-4 years of waiting is worth it!

Yes mister steam I recommend this game.
gta is the best
iiiiiiiiiiii
this game is still enjoyable and one of a kind.....Totally worth it
The best game for me ever
just play and having fun
How do you summarise the game that literally defined gaming for the last decade? GTAV Broke ground in every area of gaming and is more than just entertainment it's art. from the almost life like at times graphics to the crazy NPCs. Grand Theft Auto is so unique because it lets people become someone else fro a moment and do something that they wouldn't do in real life. It's a cathartic experience.  PLAY THIS F***** GAME!!!!!!
GOOD HA HA HA HA :)
nicew
worth a few hours
"Very fun, runs well in i5 Core, nice playlist of songs."
82 hours and i did doomsday like 20 cayos and i have millions. The economy is broken but yeah atleast its accurate to the money made from cayo

"GTA 5 is, without a doubt, a masterpiece that deserves every single one of its five stars. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this action-packed, open-world adventure that has revolutionized the gaming industry. From the immersive storyline to the stunning graphics and endless gameplay possibilities, GTA 5 delivers an unparalleled experience that keeps players hooked for hours on end."
Seru
Fun driving game.
doesnt need a review
really op game
one pin one car thanks rockstar
"the story is pretty good, but with the wait times ive had for the online aspect of the game, i could have fully beaten portal 1+2 atleast once.  overall, game is pretty neat. if you can be patient for the multiplayer part."
GTA V is probably my favorite game. the story is well previouse gta's had boring missions and then a couple interesting ones here and there and it makes the story more memorable but gta 5 is sort of like every mission could be one of those interesting missions in gta 4 persay but its still my favorite game. 100% reccomend to anybody who is mature enough
game good...
"The Npcs are overtuned, The Rewards are minimal and the desire to put a hole in your monitor grows rapidly. Play at your own peril"

Rockstar has hit rock-bottom and started digging.

i love pooping on hackers

GTA good
"VERY GOOD BUT, COULD USE MORE CAR CUSTOMIZATION AND MORE CARS, AIRCRAFT ETC IN STORY MODE"
its relly fun
amazing game! even better with rp
i fucking wanna kms with these opressors and modders but  other than that game is awesome
"I can't even count how many times I've purchased this game or on how many consoles I have played it on at this point. GTA V is one of my favorite game stories of all time and online still continues to impress me with new innovations and additions still presently being introduced with fun, well imagined stories and adventures. Nothing compares to the jelly-like driving in this game. GTA V Online is not for the faint of heart and has become a much more expansive place then when I began playing online shortly after game release. There has always been an issue with ""modders/hackers/trolls"" online and despite some friendly players every now and then, the amount of trolling and disrespectful gamers can make the game... well lets not throw a controller. Like I said, this game is not for the faint of heart but if you can hang you are going to have a great trip. I look forward to GTA VI."

This is the best game i have bought on steam!
bum
the most free game i have ever seen
yes yes good good
Great game overall  Great story mode to play and have before the arival of GTA VI
"I will never get back the 500 hours I have currently put into this game. Every time I open the game i'm immediately reminded of how much of a failure I am in life and how little my efforts mean in the grand scheme of things. You would think that a million dollars would get you some pretty cool stuff, but in gta its gets you a small bag of potato chips and an 8 oz can of coke. This game truly makes me feel small and unappreciated. Thank you rockstar."

"good game, rdr2 better tho"
this game is so gay.

I LIKE THE GRAPHICS AND CARS AND MISSION
gta online is pain
kill anyone who beeps at you
i love how i can hire prostitues
GTA Online is borderline unplayable at this point because Rockstar does nothing to address rampant modders.
i never ran out of things to do. strip club my favorite frfr
Fix the anti cheat so it actually works. I cant do any missions or play any free roam content because modders always ruin it or sit and camp the objective. Worst purchase Ive ever made. Dont play it
rehehehhehe
good g
shelgolengo bintiling best game
leaving this out of spite
"Great game, fun in both story mode and online mode! highly recommend getting this game, if you want, you can wait for it to go out on sale like me were its only 15$. Great and joyful game, you should get it"
"cant wait for gta 7. yep, was tired of waiting for gta 6. cant wait for gta 7."
Hookers and a gay stripclub highly reccomend
lol this game is so fucken shit dont play it
It's GTA. It's worth the money..

"I am an old player. I have an account where I grinded countless hours. Not only does my account not transfer, but I was banned on my new account after only one month of playing this game. I got 221 hours in this game total.  I was banned because I got tired of the countless times I was killed, often by players with a mod menu. I downloaded a mod menu, not to hurt people, but to protect myself. People were booting me from sessions, locking me in boxes, shooting fireworks out of their you know what, among many other things. I spent a hundred dollars on this game and instead of getting a warning or anything like that, I was straight suspended for 2 months. I played this game before and I even put money into it, even though my friends said it was a waste. You guys have a cash cow, a money pit, and you have a fraudulent way to run your servers. I get not wanting modders and stuff but I didn't hurt anyone. I get taking the stuff away and a ban for a day or two, but no, no warning no nothing. Like I said, I put $100 into this game, and now I can't even get online. Not that I want to join the toxic free roam where players have all the cool shit, and I can't access my account on PC. My account is on Xbox, but I'm switching to PC. Does Rockstar understand? No. Do they care? No. I'll tell you what. I'm never playing your stupid game again, and I won't be buying GTA6 if you ever come out with that, and I'm going to let everyone I know to never play it or get the new one either. I hope your corrupt company goes out of business, and I'll be sure to report your business for your fraudulent play. You guys do this all the time. I've seen it on Xbox and it's no way to run a business. You can't control the hackers, so you make everyone scared and then unsuspecting players like me are stuck after spending our hard earned money with a ban for protecting ourselves from the hackers you can't control. Your company is a joke and I hope people wake up to the garbage this game is. Don't think you're going to get away with my hundred bucks either."
i like killing ppl with my tank
Definitely one of the greater games I've played. Most fun with friends though.
pretty shit game
"VERY GOOD, VERY NICE. 8/10 would play again"

"GTA 5 is an exceptional game that delivers an immersive world, captivating storyline, and thrilling gameplay. Its attention to detail, engaging mechanics, and vibrant multiplayer make it a true gem in the gaming industry."
"Genuinely don't get how people play GTA Online with each other, the multiplayer aspect of it is so broken and barely functional."
good i love this game
the campaign is super fun to play but online is ether grind and waist your life while getting killed by hackers or spend tons of you real life money for barely any money in game.
nise game
diamond casino heist setup is atrocious (ONLINE)
its alrigth
I think that gta is a very fun game since 2013 all the way to now I know that many might not be a big fan because they have wanted gta 6 but in my eyes I think people want to hate because  the way people u mk2's and jets to do everything they can to effect them look at it a different way be different and see it through the bad people

"Very good, it doesn't make you very violent."
"drive around, punch a civillian, get 50% of your cut stolen by lester, end up getting shot by police. Thats the best summary of GTA V"

saiiiiiiiiiiiiii
i9hho-
online is shit everything else is amazing
GOOD CAM GET MODS
"i'm a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was, already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son so many happy memories"
"shoot2, drive2, boom2, steal2, kill2, ha overall ok ah"

So much hackers/modders on online mode
Fuck Rockstar Games for destroying gta online
its a great game i just wont give it a thumbs up untill i get the deluxo

This game is great. Story is awesome. Although online is full of jerks and hackers. 6/10
im gonna buy every single rockstar game on steam since i love this company so damn much
"addicting game , violence and the *We know what* , for murders and the *yes*"
"The best game ever i played, best graphic and story"

very good game and fun
sorry about the bad review last time I got game to be playable now and its really fun with menyoo and north yankton mods so I 100% recommend buying when on sale
i saw trevor's d!cknb@lls :(
Fun pewpew game
very fun and some hidden secrets in the game itself like a mine with a body in it and things like that
Still playing this game. Fantastic single player experience but what keeps this going for years is mainly GTA online at least until GTA6 is released. While GTA online does suffer from cheaters/modders/spam etc its not as bad as it used to be in the past as devs are making efforts to suppress/ban them.
"Its very fun, although a bit grindy"
gta v play
gooooooood
I just bought this game and I regret not getting it earlier. GTA 5 is a masterpiece and a wild amazing ride. 8 years after release and it feels like a well crafted modern game. Do yourself a favor and play it. :) Happy Heisting
"The game was awesome at first, but how they just kept rolling in bullshit for multiplayer and nothing at all into singleplayer past 2015 is a travesty. We were promised a singleplayer DLC way back in 2013 and nothing came to fruition.  The story was really meh but the missions themselves were fun. Having 70ish missions for a story with 3 protagonists ain't shit."
"I like everything about this game,its really fun!"
giggty
"sexy game, lester is the boss"
"The open-world style of this game, like u can do anything here, like killing the president (not actually), setting up heists and earning 6 figures from it. It's just awesome!"
omg i really enjoy this game :D
its good its what you will accept from gta games
online is pre boring
BAL
"DO NOT BUY if you have a social club account connected to your steam account, it will log you out and if you forget your email, your screwed, you would not be able to play the game and you wasted 39 dollars CAD."
gun.... car.... they removed car..... wtf???
rockstar fix frezzing please

Always awesome and addicted one
"good storyline, good game"
Strip Club is nice
this game made an new gaming era of po#n And made more then 3B on sells

i love this game but i would not recommend to a friend im very annoyed because i play on PC and my brother and all his Friends play on ps4 xbox and all my friends play on ps4 and Xbox this game needs to become cross platform or at least make gta 6 cross platform
THIS GAME IS AMAZING!
"The game has it problems such as its 10 years old and the controls are terrible, just copy a good games controls for aircraft, warthunder, battlefield stop trying to make random controls that are actual garbage"
this game sucks since it got rid of almost 200 cars in the game

"Oh you wanted to play multiplayer? Well too bad, some random fucker from God-knows-where founds some hacks online and wants to get off on making you miserable. Will they rain down invisible bombs on you wherever you go? Will they spawn an immovable fence square trap around you? Or will they just mess with the sound and try to blow out your eardrums? Who knows! But you'll keep coming back to do all the things you wish you could do in real life."
Nice G!
"Cara,que jogo perfeito! Eu não vou escrever um put* texto pra descrever o quão maravilhoso é esse jogo. Pau no seu c* RockStar"

"Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)  Oh boy, where do I even begin with Grand Theft Auto (GTA)? This game is like a rollercoaster ride on steroids with a side of extra cheese! If you're looking for a gaming experience that is absolutely bonkers, then strap in and get ready for a wild and wacky adventure.  First things first, the open-world in GTA is mind-blowing. You've got an entire city at your fingertips, just waiting to be explored and wreak havoc upon. Whether you want to take a leisurely drive through the streets, jump off a skyscraper, or cause chaos with rocket launchers and tanks, the possibilities are endless. And hey, if you ever get tired of the main storyline, you can always hop on a bicycle and chase down some unsuspecting pedestrians for a good laugh.  Let's talk about the characters, shall we? Rockstar Games has a knack for creating some of the most memorable and downright outrageous characters in gaming history. From the eccentric Trevor with his unpredictable behavior to the suave and smooth-talking Michael, you'll find yourself laughing at their antics and wondering how on earth they manage to stay alive with all the shenanigans they get into.  One of the best things about GTA is the humor. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's what makes it so entertaining. You'll encounter radio stations with hilarious talk shows, outrageous commercials, and even the occasional celebrity cameo. The satire and social commentary sprinkled throughout the game will have you chuckling and shaking your head in equal measure.  Now, let's address the elephant in the room: the mayhem. GTA is all about embracing your inner chaos agent. You can steal cars, rob banks, cause massive explosions, and go on rampages that would make Godzilla proud. Just remember, it's all in the name of good, silly fun. I mean, where else can you fly a helicopter while dressed as a chicken, shooting rockets at your enemies? Only in GTA, my friend.  In terms of technical aspects, GTA on Steam runs like a well-oiled machine. The graphics are top-notch, the controls are smooth, and the attention to detail is impressive. The developers have put in a lot of effort to create a living, breathing world that feels alive and vibrant.  However, I have to deduct one star because, let's face it, GTA isn't exactly known for its realism. Sometimes the missions can get a bit repetitive, and the AI can be a little wonky. But hey, who needs realism when you can hijack a fighter jet and do loop-de-loops in the sky?  All in all, if you're looking for a game that will make you laugh, gasp, and question your sanity, then Grand Theft Auto on Steam is the perfect choice. It's a wild and wacky adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end. Just be prepared to embrace the madness and leave your serious pants at the door. Enjoy the chaos, my fellow gamers!"
Super fun and easy to play
"this game is shit, but its my shit that took away months of my life  9/10 would grind again"
pew pew good guy die

Great to play with friends I assume
The game is pretty fun and i enjoy it
"Rockstar is a kickass company but the online portion of this game is broken. Modders are running rampant and overtaking all the servers and insta killing everybody for self gain and much more. Play for the Solo, not for the Online. Online is absolute garbage."
i love shootig and killig people
hppf
Everytime i do a heist my screen is stuck on a black screen and i cant press anything so i have to restart my game is my entire progress in my heist is gone.. fix this will ya i bought it to play not to play with errors and glitches
"very child friendly game, highly recommend for kids under 12 years old. -it teaches children how to live  -it has good rolemodels in the game -very nice community! -shows children how to make money -it teaches children how to strappen your seatbelts! -you can bring your child to a shoe store, with baddies in it. -it also teaches them how to commit mass felonies in the game. -it encourages murdering,  10/10 would make my child play again."
"best openworld game ever, have it here and my ps5"
Very nice game man!

terrilbe game  iwant to kill myself
I like to drive around and listen to music then wrap my car around a tree when i feel lonely
i like money
fucking assssssssssssssssssssssssssss 4 hours to open without errors
"If you like open world shooting games, this is the perfect game for you."
Lag sometimes and just quit the online session even when the connection is stable and working fine.
waste of money! social club stops me from even playing the game!!! redeem code from steam is already taken!!! can't get a refund because its a consumable product!!! support services ggoes in fucking circles!!! fuck soical club and fuck rockstar!!! never buying anything rockstar again!!!!
i shot a hooker
W when modded
WAY too many hackers. Like every single server online is FILLED with hackers. Also has major connections issues. And GTA 5 pushing shark cards on people by limiting the amount of money you make in-game relative to how much things cost is unethical and messed up. Rockstar is garbage these days! Comment if you have experienced hackers and believe Rockstar will never do anything about it.
:moans:
420 hours. Nice
"Story is good, multiplayer is straight doo doo fart—doesn't ban hackers who abuse but bans the ones who only give themselves money okay lol R*"
I absolutly love this
"very fun game, because I can play LSPDFR and make fun of josiah while im doin it cuz his xbox died. scrub"

"One of the best games ever made, worth every penny."

"You probably already know what this game is all about. It's fun, especially with friends, and is great when it comes to graphics and customization. Kind of awful tho when it comes to griefers and bugs."
yerdyt
Very good game that was ahead of it's time.
fvg
good game lots of fun
i fucking love this game!!!!!!
"Recent update has removed around 180 cars from the shop and the only way to access them is by buying a $5.99 a month subscription. And the ONLY way to get this subscription is by playing on Playstation or Xbox/Microsoft, if you own it on Steam, it is impossible to buy. Don't worry though, the subscription gives you just $500,000 A MONTH. Game is complete shit now, if you're gonna buy it, get it on console."
Come on. You're going to get the game and VI when it comes out. Rockstar support actually responds to lost in game items. Hackers really suck. There are lots of glitches online when operating menus. Did I mention how hackers make the game unplayable at times? You should buy this game.
very nice gaem

"This game is very fun but the new update kinda ruined it for me, they locked away a lot of cars behind paywalls that are now xbox exclusive and show no sign of a way to still get them. i can live with the servers crashing, failing to load in, the broken ai ruining heists and the constant modders/spammers but cmon rock star give us back the cars. there was no indication or reason why yall made this decision and its a bad one, even going as far as people saying that this is one of the few updates we would be way better without"
nem é viciante
veri gud game
not the best
"I decided to play online. The server had some modders. They hacked my credit card and account. If you really want to play gta online, play it either with your friends or solo."
Gud Game. Would recommend.

"After spending an incredible 1437 hours in the world of GTA V, I can confidently say that it is a game that transcends the medium. It's a testament to Rockstar's unparalleled craftsmanship, meticulous attention to detail, and commitment to creating a living, breathing virtual world. Whether you're a fan of open-world exploration, captivating storytelling, or exhilarating action, GTA V delivers on all fronts. It's a must-play for any gamer seeking an unforgettable and endlessly entertaining experience."
boring after having everything in game
very competative
Very fun and a lot to keep you occupied:)
AMAZING just way too long loading screens
"If you want to get this to play the single player mode, it's worth it. If you want to play online, DO NOT PURCHASE. Lobbies are FULL of hackers. Instead of fixing this issue, rockstar decided to enable people to play GTA ONLINE ALONE IN AN INVITE ONLY SESSION. You are forced to play this online multiplayer game alone, in a private lobby, unless you want to constantly get griefed by people flying through the air in vehicles that will blow you up in one shot. This game used to be fun, but now every aspect of the game has been finely tuned by rockstar to entice you into spending real money on shark cards. They removed content from pc players and then put it behind a pay wall THAT WE DONT EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO. PC is not anywhere near the front of their minds as they get ready to put out GTA 6. its been a year and a half since they added awesome new cars that go 30-60 mph faster than any car on pc, and yet we still arent allowed to use any of them. we all hoped that after a year, they would release it to the pc crowd, but instead of giving us these faster cars, THEY TOOK NEARLY 200 CARS AWAY FROM US. all new content is just reused assets from single player missions, they constantly reduce the earning potential from businesses, unless one is part of a double money event, and even then, those businesses are not as good at making you money as the cayo perico heist, which they put a massive cooldown on. overall, it can be a fun game and i loved it. really loved it. but the blatant lack of care for the pc community is downright infuriating week after week, month after month of being forgotten. not worth it on PC.  unless you're going to hack/mod in the online. in which case, congratulations, you are now part of the problem. the only way to have fun on this game is to either try to have fun grinding boring repetitive missions over and over again just to purchase an overpriced, underperforming car. any car that was reasonably priced for its performance was REMOVED FROM THE DAMN GAME.  pathetic support for an extremely large community. again, i used to love this game but it feels like having a girlfriend who goes out every weekend and cheats on you and then comes home expecting you to take her out on a date. dont let rockstar c*ck you. if you want to play it that badly just wait for gta 6 or be prepared to be bitterly disappointed after a few hours, once you realize how long itll take to get something that doesn't really enhance the gameplay experience. Or just do what rockstar really wants you to do. not enjoy the game. but spend more money on it in the hopes that you might actually eventually enjoy it."
if you drive around an MK2 Opp and just blow everything up i hope your grandma flicks your nipples
This is the most important review I have ever written.  Please read and listen close  YES this is a game YES I understand this is roleplay YES I know most normal people will not be affected by this in their real life but unstable people are not and love this  tell you about me.  I work for the police RL.  I was very late to try this game bc I thought it was misguided... thought it was not  a good influence  finally I think maybe it would be fun so I bought it  opening scene I had to kill about 20 cops just to take money from a bank they had families sons and daughters wives they are trying to keep you safe!  money that does not belong to them I feel the adrenaline rush it is seductive but you ruin families... children left without a father and wives without a husband to be honest I started to feel the rush wanted to kill just to get out  THAT IS THE END OF CIVILIZATION I truly believe as a gamer THIS game makes killers in real life make people want to murder their schoolmates  this game is trash and ruins our lives...   back in the days of DOOM many journalists argued that violence is supported by video games I thought it was nonsense I play video games too :) but always against an evil force something trying to destroy humanity  THIS game trys to destroy humanity and I think it is working look at all the deaths IRL in America... random shootings  As I played I got angry at cops for stopping me and that is horrible this BREEDS discontent and desire to steal money save our future don't love this game  please do not appreciate this game
its an OG game and everyone should experience the masterpiece.
"A Game that I would happily purchase on every platform available and spend time with my friends to always kill some time.  It has always received constant updates with regards to graphics, game modes, vehicles, events, missions, customisation, apartments, activities and more.  I will briefly say that the main story line is an experience one must play more than once, it is unforgettable and action-packed with a lot of exciting moments and many interesting ways to play around the world and how it'll be affected.  But the main focus is the multi-player, it is without a doubt a true experience that MUST be enjoyed with friends as it brings about the true possibilities this game can provide which consist of Heists, Death matches, Races, Casinos, Water Activities, Illegal Business, Hitmen and more.  There will always be a memorable moment for everyone, from struggling to perfect a Heist without any deaths, to the joys of travelling in Custom Sport Cars whilst listening to the Radio which constantly get updated and play a mix of classic songs and modern rap whenever you choose.  9/10 - I wish I have a chance to experience the game for the first time again."

R* sells a game where your IP is public via modders. My advice - play at your own risk.

"mui guud el game tio, recomendao chicos, comprenlo chicos"
I fucking hate myself
doesnt work.
"The game as a whole is awesome whether you're a solo player or you've a group of friends. I mean it's GTA. The only thing that I had about is this game are some of the bugs & glitches. Like if you get in a heist or a job with your friends. Once, its over. You would either be staring into a black or white screen forever and sometimes it works but when it does. It sends you and your friends to different closed sessions. They've a quick join feature in your in-game phone which allows you to get into different sort of jobs quicker. Howver in various modes it doesn't work like the cayo perico heist, doomsday heist, diamond casino heist, etc. you might get into the lobby sometimes but after that it automatically kicks you or ends the job. Now there are various other problems but these ones are the ones that many people go through and the major ones. Minor ones are like sometimes if some ends a job while you're in the lobby. You teleport under the building or in the  apartment with no way to get out so you've to kys in order to get out but these minor problems doesn't matter at all. PLEASE try to fix the major ones.... Update: Nowadays even if you get into a heist when someone invites to it doesn't work. Great Job R*"

"This Game will not launch and I'm honestly done messing with it. installing, reinstalling updating drivers verifying game file integrity. How sad and unprofessional does this company have to be to sale a game that will not launch. I have never wasted so much time trying to get a game to work. I will never purchase another product from this company again. your time may not be valuable to you but mine is!"
i hope every single developer gets lung cancer  10/10
its good'

amazing game :) I think it's a good game but it can be a little annoying when it comes to character design and sometimes the cops are annoying too.
"Good, but better in New Gen Xbox/PS5"
very good 👌👍
Very nice games some bugs and the player base is not great but overall good
modder game
"I have had no problem logging around the first week i got the game. But now its unplayable. I cant even get in-game without having to wait 2 to 3 hours, like bruv. I'm just trying play this great video game. But now i cant even get in a server. This is really ridiculous."
GTA is very fun
GAME HAS BEEN HACKED CANT LOG INTO ROCKSTAR
This is an amazing game I have had a lot of fun playing it. Would definitely recommend.
very good i love comithing war crimes with planes on big buildings
Good game. It has lots of stuff to do and its worth the $$.
"massa, boy"
online is a grind but both single and online is fun 100% recommend 10/10
Best shooting game a gamer could ask for

Grand Theft Game
even better on pc than ps4
"The chernobyl nuclear disaster had less toxicity than younger online player base of this game, be prepared for messages ""I hope u get cancer soon"" after blowing up a kuruma full of 12yolds or shooting down the opressor mk2 thats been terrorising the server, otherwise great"
That’s the best game ever which would never die:)

"pretty nifty game, would buy agaib"
For me this game is one of the best on earth. The story is great and the multiplayer it's even greater. It's a very realistic game with good graphics and customization.
so many hackers it is not even funny
bcuz yes

Watching a black screen is more enjoying then this game but i must admit it is fun 10/10

"L.;,"
dope.                                    TREVOR is awesome!
"Single player: A+ An amazing game!  Online: C+  The problem with online is hackers, constant black screens, disconnects and glitches. Online has a lot of content but it is plagued with what is mentioned before"
very very gay
"Create: in the multiplayer online the Create level UI is glitchy and defective,the multiplayer gameplay sucks alot of the time. the storyline in single player is boring as hell, and the other players are either too good, Cheating or useing hack mods, or a waste of time to interact with; theres no mic connection that seams to work, maybe its just my setup?, I just dont think the open world design is entertaining enough; and I cant use VR in the multiplayer because of anticheat! :"
It really simulates L.A very well and has a great story
fivem is the funnest part
"This game is so fun, the game adds very small detail to the game! An example like each building or house looks great! I would likely recommend this game for others. The game is just very addicting, got it a few days ago."
i love gta.
C'mon its gta
GOOD GAME FOR SINGLEPLAYER
"i love this game, need to make gta6 now rockstar!!!"
"online, campaign, and fivem fun"
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT GTA EXCEPT THE FLYING MECHANISM
I love GTAV so much bruh- mainly the online part but the story part is great as well !!
"still havent been able to find the strip club, ill update you guys when i find happiness"
very nice game play and excellent story
"Hope you like sitting in insanely long ad filled loading screens and having your game constantly crash, because that's what you're gonna get if you buy this game. Does not matter what specs your PC has or how fast your internet is, the game itself is the problem. Do not buy under any circumstances, get a game that actually works more than 50% of the time."
uhkhkjghj
This game is excellent! so I thought about completely switching from epic to steam because of the Sales and variety of games. I had this on epic and I loved it so much that I also bought it on Steam
This game is literally worth it as just a driving simulator it wouldn't need any more content
granding my theft auto all over the 5 places
"A decent game for LSPDFR, which is basically a modded version of GTA 5 for becoming a cop."
idk but its good
This game made me kms i love it
"To go around as your own person feels powerful, it's fun! There's so many things to choose from, even if some of the driving is really bad in a weird way. Like I keep hitting and then I fly up in the air. There's even boats though, and you can swim even that is weird also. The characters are all kinda ugly. Sometime a girl wanna pretty thang. But you can even play with other characters who you know (you can play with your friends who can make their own characters as well. If it isn't tooooo expensive like when I got it, relatively speaking, then sure, I don't think it'll be so bad to give old screecher a whirl. And what I mean is that this whole game is 100 GB. It's so expensive to the storage space. And even because is computer is not soooooooo good it kind of acts slow, really if I'm honest. I would love to go inside more the buildings though. If that can happen in the next version of the game, I would be grateful. Otherwise, save for the ugly, slow, and stupid qualities this game clings to, I'm truthfully having a blast. We'll see what else I can figure out, too, and how many hi-jinx I will sneak around to act."
"If you haven't tried it yet, simply make the purchase when it's on sale as it's a bit too old for full price (2013 - 2023). But still, one of the best titles on steam, definitely a good ALL-TIME-CLASSIC."

"boobs, drugs and guns. Whats not to love."
"GTA Online 1/10: is a disaster filled with 12 year olds griefing 24/7. Not to mention, here is something very hilarious about GTA V Online. You pay a game, where legally you have the right to play as you paid for a product. Rockstar does nothing to Modders that can now crash your game at anytime even in singleplayer. This is really game breaking. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GARBAGE Until Rockstar fixes this.  Campaign story 10/10"
This is a fun game even more fun with friends
made me =cream
"It's a good game. But, the infinity loading screen bug needs to be fixed. It is happening in Online Mode."
"Great story, The gta online server are mid and overall 8.7/10"
penis boobie fart sex
If you can get some buddies it gets even better
Aside from the fact that Rockstar games is too cheap to hire active admins or at least make it to where everyone isn't scripting this game can be a lot of fun.
"I would not recommend the game as is due to the sheer amount of bugs I've been experiencing as of late, makes doing missions, heists, and even basic prep work a pain. Not to mention most lobbies have multiple moders in them and can be a real pain in the neck. Rockstar needs to add more maintenance to these servers to prevent bugs and to cut down on the moders, but they won't because they're cheap as hell.   Only get the game if it's on sale and wouldn't recommend trying public lobbies, not much fun to be had."
ive had fun playing this game
it saved my marriage

"My rockstar account was hacked and I can no longer play the game, No available customer support, been waiting half a day and heard nothing back. I love the game itself and I hope i can get back my account and keep playing. the support so far has not been good. my account email was changed and a new account under my email appeared, I cannot access my old account even through the restore email. I need help"
"Yeah it's fun, I'd recommend getting the criminal enterprise starter pack though."
no2 best game ever
"is a swag game, would smash"
played for hours on xbox and pc is just as fun plus you can do rp servers
hackers evreywhere but some are nice
jobs
With mods this game is fun its fun normal too but online public lobbys are toxic but some are cool u should play it
"Please give me awards, i need steam points"
"Fuck money, get cars, or something."
Spider man
Pay to win. Boring. Grindy. Pathetic. The fact that the game is not only not free but also has a membership is unhinged. This game has nothing going for it. It is also filled with modders but won't let me play the game bc I changed a file so I could play all activities in a private session. It's actually disgusting that the game forces you to play certain activities in public lobbies. That will just result in flying motorcycles bombing you and stealing your shipment. Through uninstalling and reinstalling the game it still says I'm doing a modified version of the game.
very nice 😏
Rasist 9 year olds and pedos
this is probably one of the BEST purchases you could ever make!!11!!

Verry nice game :D
Half of my played time was spent in loading screen.
not much to 10/10 game
mmhhm yes kill innocent civilians
"The game it self is PERFECT in literally every way , BUT the security is so trash and unbelievably aweful in case of banning cheater , Everyone who faces a challenge in 1vs1 will use it immediately without even being worried of getting banned , AND they can do tons of cheats like kick u of the lobby and even making ur game crash  I mean seriously how patheric can a game's security be ? This game's is even worse ."
This gave me aids. 10/10
very fun but i recommend getting a controller
cheeseburger with a slice of cheese
veri gud and adikting
Do not buy this game get the og versions of the old games or dont play gta at all. The amount of hackers and bugs in the game are insane for how long this game has been out and for how much money is up rockstars ass. Your IP is also connected to your rockstar ID so if a hacker gets ahold of that then ggs. Dont waste your time on playing this game and I swear if I find out you buy shark cards I will find your rockstar ID and Boot you offline so I save you from playing a shitty ass fucking game.
Can't even play because of the REQUIRED social club account
I love when my friends torture me. :)
so cool 😁😁😁😁

GRAND THEFT AUTO V

Best. Game. Ever.
So this fun gta game is great! you can even download fiveM and do some realistic online game plays through your GTA v game! and in the game its self they have system set up where people who cause chaos get stuck in server after a while with others who cause much chaos too! BUNCH of bonuses through out the past 2 years! from BIG event and fun ones one time they had ecola vs spunk! I TRIED MY BEST TO MAKE SPUNK SODA WIN! but more cokecol.. i mean ecola fans out there :3 UMM the game it self also add community maps at times for there 3X events 24/7 there will be a 2X or 3X event missions you can find on menu of game.driving is cool cause after a while you can remember which cars drive better on different terrains realistic..? IDK cars sorry but i know more about GTA cars than real life cars cause of this game lol. looking to make quick cash on game all you gotta do is wait for them 3X events and play them alot and boom! easy 3-4 million in one day from that. WAs able to buy krieger for first car in game and it cost 3.5 million in game due to the 3X events! tons of outfit options and seems like they gonna keep adding stuff till GTA 6. I HOPE they keep the #X events and community maps adding for events to game after they make GTA 6 but if they dont i hope they make GTA 6 just as fun as GTA 5 good multiplayer coop and vs and epic story THANKS ROCKSTAR STAY AWESOME I AM GLAD WE HAD THE CHANCE TO PLAY THESE CRAZY GRAND THRIFT AUTO GAMES IN OUR LIFE! FUN TIMES!
I liked the story mode even though its a few years old
its yummy
i lave dis gam i recmend tis gejm varjy mach

"Fun game, if you don't already own it though I do not know if I would bother"
"Rockstar is not what it once was. The real game you play is trying to install, activate and start the game and then combat RockStar's stupid error codes and messages. Your mission is to convince them you purchased the game - a mission which will be re-assigned to you every two years!"
"good game, needs more wine flavours though"
its good online and ofline game it has cool features as the casino or heist that you can do  the singel minus is that you cant  play crosplatform
its gta like no shit its good fags
ochei
I really like this game
Free Roaming IS awsomre
good story but most of online is grinding

"To be honest, this is a great game. But Rockstar has been recently making this game worse and worse. I cannot sell my product because I know no one who plays the game (Ill run out of time and not sell everything). Everything is getting more and more expensive and they are removing vehicles. I can't take this anymore, i'm quitting."
"Old GTA online but still GOLD!!! Nice to chilling driving around with hacker try to kaboom everything, good luck."
it good fun and I CAN BE MONKE
op Game

"This game is currently worse than it's ever been. Infinite loading screens are back, Rockstar Games Launcher won't work unless you set compatibility mode for it to Windows Vista Service Pack 2, and if I even try to Alt+Tab out of it just once, it crashes to a non-responsive state. That, coupled with the fact that cars are now being paywalled to PS5 owners? It's growing less and less appealing every day.  Don't waste your fucking money on this piece of shit anymore."
awesome game what can i say
very very addicting
it's one of the best games ever made
GREAT GAME !!! !
absolute dogshit game. I regret buying this.
"It's hard to recommend a game that puts their content and supposed ""unused vehicles"" (which are still very popular) behind a pay wall. Rockstar is just showing their true colours and want to monetize everything, Next thing you know they will add loot boxes and micro transactions (Oh wait they already did).  The only good thing about the game is LSPDFR, for others the PvP was okay (or so I've heard) but I personally never liked the whole encouraging griefing thing nor the micro-transactions nor the encouragement of kids playing a MATURE game when they can't even comprehend common sense. They NEED to leave Fortnite alone where it is because true gamers do not like that crap or griefing for no damn reason.  Rockstar is shying away from it's true fan base that has been there since the beginning to trade it for a quick buck from kids that just want shiny things and ignorant parents that let them get it without checking or just don't care. So far just about every major company in the industry is only out to make a quick dollar and not staying true to their core values and it is just sickening. DLC's were enough and the only way to stop this is for the gaming community to put our foot down and stop this in it's tracks before it gets exponentially worse."
"this game is really cool, although i spent most of my hours on the online, their is so much to do and although you have to grind a little bit to get to all the heists and all the fun stuff it is worth it in the end. This game is amazing to play with friends on the online version. Overall I love this game."
Stop taking our cars assholes
this game leave you relaxed and release anger  plus you can play with friends crosss play
removed a ton of cars like 190ish.... this game is suposed to be a game about cars..... :((
Nope
"Basically: Buy this game when it's on sale or get a cheap CD Key. Play this game if like modding games in general, or to play something other than cuckstar online (like FiveM) Single player modding & FiveM are the ONLY reason to keep playing. DO NOT play this game if still wanted to play GTA Online, as hackers run freely. All in all worth your money."
"Best game i have ever played, i have played this game 3 hours a day. Very fun, never can get bored of it because there is so much to do."
Great story. Immersive environment. What more could you want?

"Even after a Decade the game is very enjoyable , the details put into some of the things still blows my mind . GTA online is also very fun for a casual gaming experience for both solo and with friends.While content can definitely be more being a decade old game , its still enough . The car designs and newer heists are one of the strongest features."

"[h1]GTA V (STEAM EDITION)[/h1]  This review is from someone who's never played GTA before so just so you know. Ngl the gameplay is great and the whole way the game and story is structured is really good. Story is great and in general a great game. Cars are rip-offs from real ones (Karin Calico = Toyota Celica (1990s) etc) but they're still epic. You can do a lot in terms of customisation of cars in both Story Mode and Online. One main problem for me is the hackers on GTA online. A while back I crashed into another car in online by accident and this guy comes out throwing whatever at me, before I know it I'm GTA online level 106 and have found all collectables or whatever they're called. Also the 106GB storage needed is a bit big for a lot of people, pretty sure it's mainly for the map for non-online play, not sure but it is big.

i Like this game
Come on... It's GTA 5!
no i already told you i dont want a nightclub
removed many stuff to resell and milk away in the future.
i like to fuck the hookers and kill innocents
Breaking Bad the game!
very good game i got memories from when i was like 9 or smth when i was with my nephew big
It's a great game but online is too full of Griefers and modders but if you play in an invite only session you don't have to worry. The story mode is so content rich and is overall fun to play
"Grand Theft Auto 5 delivers an exhilarating experience with its enjoyable costume customization and a wide variety of cars to choose from, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in their chosen roles and missions. The game's interactive multiplayer aspect adds an extra layer of excitement and engagement. While the graphics are visually appealing, especially with an upgraded VGA, the passage of time has made it evident that newer titles like Red Dead Online have surpassed GTA 5 in terms of visual presentation. Nonetheless, the game's captivating storyline, a trademark of Rockstar, leaves a lasting impact, particularly the memorable decision of choosing which character receives the final shot after spending the entire game with two companions. Overall, Grand Theft Auto 5 stands as an excellent game, but fans eagerly await the arrival of a new installment in the series, perhaps in the form of GTA 6."
good game but you want team
cool and more cooler
good cars
This game made me fart
"GTA V  today is classic game. And there is nothing new i can say about it.  All best. But after 370h gameplay,  new instalation, i have problem with running game, because Rockstar Launcher is blocking running.  I bought this title  on steam,  now i have error  that  my steam is not linked with rockstar game account.   It is kinda frustratring that  launcher is blocking  playing  after 370h of gameplay.  I like all GTA titles in serie,  now i wanted to let my kid try to play game,  but i cant run game...   If i pay game at steam - i want to play and run it trought  steam.    This is so frustratring issue  that i will maybe download some pirated copy, i dont know what else to do after contacting tech support."

This game is better than the last Saints Row.
i dislike that ps4 players cant play with xbox or pc players
"I have recently had the pleasure of diving into the world of Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA 5) and its online counterpart, and I must say it has been an absolutely fantastic experience. Rockstar Games has truly created a masterpiece that captivates players with its immersive gameplay, stunning visuals, and an expansive open world that offers endless opportunities for excitement and exploration.  One of the standout features of GTA 5 is its compelling storyline. The game introduces us to three unique protagonists, each with their own compelling backstories and personalities. The writing and voice acting are top-notch, drawing players into a gritty and often humorous narrative filled with unexpected twists and turns. The character development is superb, making it easy to form a strong connection with these virtual personas.  The open world of Los Santos is an absolute marvel. The attention to detail is astounding, from the bustling streets to the towering skyscrapers and lush countryside. Whether I'm cruising through the city in a flashy sports car or embarking on an adrenaline-pumping heist, the level of immersion is unparalleled. The world feels alive, with pedestrians going about their daily lives, emergency services responding to incidents, and a wide array of activities to engage in, such as tennis, golf, and even skydiving.  GTA Online takes the already outstanding single-player experience and expands it into a multiplayer realm. It provides a vast and dynamic playground for players to team up or compete against each other in a variety of game modes and activities. Whether I'm participating in adrenaline-fueled races, engaging in intense heists with friends, or simply exploring the open world together, the multiplayer aspect adds a whole new dimension of fun and excitement.  Rockstar Games has done an excellent job of supporting GTA Online with regular updates and new content, ensuring that the experience remains fresh and engaging. They consistently introduce new missions, vehicles, and game modes, keeping players hooked and invested in the online world. The ability to customize and personalize my character and own luxury properties provides a sense of progression and achievement, further enhancing the long-term appeal of the game.  Furthermore, the community surrounding GTA 5 and Online is incredibly vibrant and diverse. Interacting with other players from around the world adds an unpredictable and dynamic element to the gameplay. Whether it's teaming up for cooperative missions or engaging in heated battles in the competitive modes, the multiplayer aspect fosters a sense of camaraderie and friendly competition.  In conclusion, GTA 5 and its online counterpart provide an unparalleled gaming experience. The captivating storyline, immersive open world, and the dynamic multiplayer component make it a true masterpiece. Rockstar Games has created a virtual world that offers endless hours of entertainment, and their commitment to ongoing updates and content ensures that players are continually engaged. If you're looking for a game that combines thrilling action, immersive storytelling, and limitless possibilities, GTA 5 and GTA Online are an absolute must-play."
MY DREAM COME TRUE
gut spiel albert stupid guck das du gta rp download
tdads
fun killing people
it's a nice game
this game is so much fun :P
Sadly another great company has fallen due to greed. Nothing but a tool for Cockstar to sell you Sharkcards. the story mode is good but online is total garbage. Newest update removed ~180 cars from the game so that you will instead buy the new garbage cars that came with the new update. FUCK Rockstar and what they have become.
its entertaining
modders:<
fck u
VEry good game online and story mode are very great

Damm bro the hot chicks in the strip club
I wont lie this is my first time playing in a while but GTA is so much better on PC.
Yall ever been hit and run well boom get your gta on buddy
the most optimised game i've ever played ever
"very good game, can't wait to watch my grandchildren play GTA 6"
eh hehe
"fun asf, alot to do. highly recommend."
"Absolutely unplayable, takes as long as rust to load into a session and the online scene is so overwhelmed by hackers that i would say there is a 100% chance they will crash your game (Most grievers mod of choice). Do not play unless you have mods installed that stop the modders from crashing your game."
재미있음
"$2000 PC, 8 minute load time. New $4000 Mega PC, 9 minute load time... Load in, die to hacker-> find new session-> ""Couldn't find session. going back to offline"" -> Find new session-> 100 submarines are falling from the sky?-> find new session-> ""Session is full, finding new session.""->Find new session-> Session is currently as max capacity for CEO's, VIP's, and MC Presidents.""->Create invite only session-> *GTA closes*-> Start GTA-> *Loads in 30 seconds*-> Play Cayo perico heist for 10000000th time for money.-> Still steal $5 NPC car because its more convenient than waiting on one of my rides to come."
i beat up a hooker and got away with it
Its only the 3rd or 4th time I have purchased it.
"this game is actually so bad the graphics suck, the story sucks, everything is expensive, even online sucks their's nothing to do, the heists are so easy and getting money is WAY too easy, too many little kids and WAY too many modders, gta 6 would definitely suck too, do not buy this game it sucks"
it is boring sometimes when you can't find the mission
"Funny game, but still pretty hard for a noob like me =)))"
GTA IS NOT GRAND THEFT AUTO ITS TWO VERY DISTINCT GAMES
good for kids
Great sex physics
gta funny shoot people lol
god 9/10 goty merecido mejor gta de la saga facil
ap pistol = fun

VERY GAY
yes rae game is god
"overrated, bad devs, gradually cheapening the quality of the IP with lame shark card nonsense, stupid alien nonsense, etc."
It's so good that I didn't care when my mom was beating the shit out of my dad!
DO NOT BUY- Rockstar keeps releasing DLC's for this jank ass game that they dont even put the time in to fix their own launcher. I have restarted the story to this game at least eight separate times only to be kicked out of online to do the story yet again. Quit giving Rockstar money and uninstall to save yourself the headache.
Fun with friends (Help me)
sliy gun go
this game is so fuck!ng good
Dad?
"very fun""help me i can't leave my room"""
How to play Gta Rob a bank Loose the cops Go into hiding for 10 years Start up GTA V
"this game is crack...frustratingly doing the same missions over and over again to no gain.filled with bugs and hackers,errors and crashes.money spent on an unfinished product.but is still addictive becaus no other game compares.yet extremely frustrating"
Love That Game!!!!!!
game fucking sucks
"the amount of hackers and modders online is insane , yet rock star refuses to do anything about it  . too many crashes in between missions to warrant a reccommendation to this toxic pile of sh#t . steam asked me if i wanted to revise my review and its still shit after 18 hours more play time lol"
it is very fun but the hangers are confeusing becuase you have to do osmething with simon to unlock them and it is a house hole
"This game is good to play in story mode but almost impossible with all the little kids blowing up the whole map in online mode. if the devs want people to play i do not understand why they continue to allow this absolute disgrace to continue to happen. i get maybe 30 min in online mode before somebody logs in and decides to continually destroy the whole map. this is not fun for anybody trying to actually play the game and get anywhere in online mode and i can not see how it is entertaining for the mentally challenged person doing it. if i was you i would not buy this game and if you have REFUND it ASAP!!! Rockstar you have changed bro, you used to be cool. now just a sad existence in a ever evolving world of epic games. so to wrap up this game is TRASH!!!!"
thornton duggan fears me
I would if you just wanted to play the story mode but if you want to play online good luck doing anything without modders fucking up 5-10 minutes into any session you get into. Just ruins the game completely.
itsss realy fun
"This game is the best game in the world, but is at the same time the worst game in the world. Interpretate that as you wish."
"They took out over 180 cars from GTA online, to put behind a paywall in this 12 yearold, and already milked to death game. Scumbag Rockstar. They also stopped bringing over content that consoles get, to PC, giving us neutered content patches. Look it up and avoid the game."
I originally liked this game and enjoyed lpaying online however after their move of legacy items to a subscription service i can no longer support this game or company please dont put your time into this game that treats the community like dirt.
it doesn't run on Linux / SteamDeck anymore ....
yippee-ki-yay
just wait for the gta 6
GAMES FIRE BUT TOO EASY
better than valorant
best and idk
"Incredibly buggy, slow to load, and a pain to use. Great game otherwise I suppose..."

it sucks for getting signing in because IT DOESNT LET ME ADD MY DAMN EMAIL
reddit
i recomend this game to 9 year olds. btw you should definitely go to the shoe club : )
"""Lets make a subscription service for a 10+ year old game. Put 90% of the cars we have behind the paywall. THEN lets make it unavailable to the pc users. Cause fuck'em!"" Rockstar is a fucking joke of a company. Need their greedy hands chopped off and heads shoved in a garbage disposal. Fuck Rockstar! Don't give this company a cent of your money. Illegally download the game and mod/hack the shit out of it."
its goog
scumbag company locking stuff people already paid for behind a paywall
"fun, fucking fun"
Fortnite ripoff
"The driving in the game is therapeutic.  One of the best things about GTA V Online is the variety of cars and vehicles you can drive, especially the ones that can fly. Yes, you heard me right, there are some cars and bikes that can take off and soar through the air like a bird or a plane. Imagine the fun you can have with your friends, cruising around the city, dodging bullets and missiles, and laughing at the poor souls stuck on the ground. Here are some of the coolest flying vehicles you can get in GTA V Online:  Imponte Deluxo: This is a classic sports car that looks like it came straight out of a sci-fi movie. It has gull-wing doors, a sleek design, and a hidden feature: it can fly. At the click of a button, you can switch between car mode and hover/fly mode, and glide over any obstacle in your way. You can also equip it with weapons such as a machine gun and homing missiles, making it a deadly aerial threat. The Deluxo can be purchased from Warstock Cache & Carry for $5,750,0001. Pegassi Oppressor: This is a motorcycle that has wings and a rocket boost. It can jump and glide for a limited amount of time, or use the boost to fly faster and higher. It can also be fitted with weapons such as a machine gun and homing missiles, making it a versatile vehicle for both land and air combat. The Oppressor can be purchased from Warstock Cache & Carry for $2,750,0001. Pegassi Oppressor Mk II: This is an upgraded version of the Oppressor, that replaces the wheels with the ability to hover and fly. It’s faster, more agile, and more stable than its predecessor, and can also be fitted with weapons such as homing missiles and countermeasures. The Oppressor Mk II can be purchased from Warstock Cache & Carry for $8,000,0001. Mammoth Thruster (Jetpack): This is a jetpack that lets you fly like a superhero. It has two thrusters on the sides that propel you forward and upward, and two smaller ones on the back that help you steer. It can also be fitted with weapons such as homing missiles, making it a fun and powerful gadget to use. The Thruster (Jetpack) can be purchased from Warstock Cache & Carry for $2,500,0001.  These are just some of the flying vehicles you can get in GTA V Online. There are also planes, helicopters, blimps, and more that you can use to explore the sky. You can also do various activities with your friends in GTA V Online, such as races, deathmatches, heists, missions, freemode events, business battles, drug wars2, and more. GTA V Online is a game that never gets boring, because there’s always something new and exciting to do with your friends."
i like this game it is really based off a real city>
God Tier
these dirt bags done went an got rid of most of the cars you can buy online that we've had for 10 years and made GTA+ which is $5 a month to get the cars back that we had for 10 years. Best part is you cant get GTA+ on PC. Rockstar you're petty asf for that and you know it. GTA 6 is literally going to be just micro transactions for everything.
"fun, but dark."
Removing cars from the game and setting them behind a payed subscription is a no go.
za best
mt bom o jogo o unico problema é a comunidade
CRIME IS NOT LEGAL
Absolute bullshit that you cant transfer any of your data over from PS4 or Xbox over to PC. All the time that was spent grinding out the game is now fucking pointless since i cant use any of the data.
its been fun
pizdoasa
the strip club makes my weenur feel funny
best game i ever playd yust buy the kasatka and do the cayo poriko hist easy get milions of mune suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
i like the fact that car
leng
my account got stolen and that fucker change my email. Now cant even open the game
Gta story: Love the story mode a lot. I can only recommend it because I am really satisfied with the game!  Gta online: The players are wild and absolutely crazy and messy but it is what it is. Don't recommend it when you don't like toxic players
pray to god your mom doesnt walk in.....
it ass
want play on pc!!!!
it good but hacker bad
idk ive had it sense it came out so i cant really say much
"Horrible support team, I have had the game for a week now, and still am unable to connect to online, because a glitch the system has, i have contacted the support team 3 different times, and get the same bot response everytime, and when i select i would like to speak to a company representative, i never get a response back- fix ur game."
"Lost access to my Rockstar social club account, so now I can't even play singleplayer - whats the point in 'purchasing' games anymore when you can just have your ability to play them taken away by a 3rd party.  Fuck Rockstar"
"After all these years and all the time I've played I finally have enough money to buy an apartment and a car... Just kidding I haven't touched online since 2016...  Used to mod singleplayer until Rockstar kept pushing out pointless updates that would break everything to do with the SP modding scene, since then I haven't touched the game and that was October 2022.  Now I'm down the middle with this game, I do recommend it for the singleplayer experience and the top shelf story telling by R* but can not recommend it for the online side, too much greed with the shark cards, too many cheaters and hackers from what I've heard and just general BS from T2/R* about things through the years."
strip club had me busting em out for hours
add sex gamemode and shoe store very good !!!!11!!!
VERY GUD👍👍👍👍👍
i love this game so bad
online is absolute shit single is kinda good wasted so much time idk how lol.
bad for beginners
WAY TOO BUGGY FOR A GAME THATS BEEN HERE FOR 10 YEARS!
"Nice, especially when u use FiveM"
"Steam says I have 352 hours on GTAV/GTAO. Considering I ported my character over from Xbox 360, it should be at least double that.   So lets say 112 hours.  I have spent aproximately 112 hours playing this video game.  Yet I cannot recommend it.  Yes I have had some of the best gaming I've ever had with this game. I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign, I played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside. I even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card. I was there for the DNS glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur, and I was there when they cut literally everyone's funds to 500,000 as a ""fix""  But one day I was playing and some guy joins the server, forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him, freezes us, and makes bags of money rain from the sky.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not stupid, I know people hack and people give out money. I've seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc. I've generally ignored them, but this guy didn't give me much of a choice.  Regardless once I figured out what was happening I left the server. I didn't want the money in my bank so I blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up.  A couple hours later I was temporarily banned and my character was reset. I lost all of my cars, including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched, not to mention the majority of that 112 hours I'd put into having a character I liked.  Rockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me. My ingame wallet was raped and they decided to blame the victim.  There was no way for me to voice my displeasure to Rockstar. No appeals process for them to hear my case, check the evidence, and see my innocence.  That was several months ago. I uninstalled the game and let it go.  I'm only writing this now so that others can see what they're getting into.  Yes, as I've said, this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content. From an objective standpoint, its very good value for money and the free, regular, DLC is a nice touch.  What ruins all of that is the way Rockstar treats its customers. There's no consistency, and no compassion. I know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and they've never had any trouble. Yet it happens to me once, without my consent, and I get temp banned and lose literally everything.  What motivation is there to play legitimately then? If people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision, and those who don't can get away with it indefinitely.  Hell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience.  Rockstar, if you actually end up reading this, please start treating your customers with some compassion. Don't assume we're all hackers."
"I personally have no problem with modders. i do have a problem with Rockstar. Their flawed social club system, has led to my social club account being stolen. just happened, nothing i could do about it. That is bad in itself..... what makes matters worse. is that you need to be logged into your social club account, to play the single player game."
🤘😌🤘
fun game so many modders though

"Chop, Chop."
this game is the worst i recommend no one to play this trash game
I think cars can fly but not for long
"This game is about as fun as sticking my balls in a waffle iron, cause when you're not dealing with griefers on their flying bike, you have to deal with modders that constantly blow you up or crash your game, but the moment that you use a menu for protection purposes, Rockstar decides to screw you over and start you from scratch instead of dealing with the other, much like a parent picking the golden child who broke something and blames it on you who did nothing."

"i have done the same thing for 164 hours, 10/10, would buy again"
EXcellent game
bada hi mazedar game ha
can i get a refund
bring back the cyclone rockstar.....
"Barely had the game for a couple days, can't go into any lobby without there being a hacker. i didn't leak anything about my account and some Chinese hacker stole my account and changed the email/password. Rockstar support is ""too busy"" to help and steam won't refund me cause i played more than 2 hours. Great job Rockstar for not providing 2FA and relying on 3rd party software. lmao"
Very good game to play with friends
JE BAAT
You can do whatever you want
Fun Freemode Game!
"My balls hadn't even dropped when I first played this, and now I have a kid... never completed the story and still don't plan on it. Multiplayer is fun with friends, but nowadays, you might as well play PADDYPOWER.COM; you might make the money back you spent buying some flying bullshit motorbike."
I love shooting people
This game is the best game of all time
vile game full of hacker
superb game but cons are the sh*tty hackers
bad launcher

"I love this game mostly because of the amazing story mode. This game can get on my nerves in online mode because of all of the kids that just like to kill everybody else and not just enjoy the game, but overall an amazing game and I 100% recommend to everyone that is thinking of buying the game."
"Unable to play because I have to login with a ""Rockstar social club"" or whatever it's called.  But I can only login with a specific one to which I don't even own the email adres anymore."
"Online is now dead to me; continuing to nurf existing heists, hackers/modders/griefers  run rampant, peoples accounts being hacked left and right, and now removing content to try and pinch more money out of the consumers through a subscription service. This has officially gone too far, this is by far the worst main stream publisher/developer now. They have made more money off an individual product than anyone else in human history, yet they are still this desperate for more."
VERY MUCH SUPER GAME
Online hacker invited me to his apartment  -_-
GTA IV is better but this is still good
ㄴㄷㅀ
my fav games is Red Dead Redemption II & Grand Theft Auto V
its fun with mods
everything is great
very low
probably the best game ever
WELL its gta
"Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best thrilling open-world action-adventure game that I've played till date. It combines a gripping narrative with immersive gameplay. Set in the fictional city of Los Santos, it follows three protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—each with a unique story. The game excels in its realistic graphics, diverse missions, and an expansive open-world environment. With engaging heists, dynamic characters, and a plethora of activities, GTA V offers an unparalleled gaming experience. Whether cruising through the city, participating in high-stakes robberies, or exploring the vast landscape, the game captivates players with its depth and attention to detail. A modern classic that continues to captivate audiences till date despite being released such a long time ago."
"The campaign is fantastic and immersive, so go play it if you haven't. However,  There are too many modders in GTA Online, I encounter at least one each session. They have the powers to completely break your online experience. If you do anything to annoy them perhaps accidentally, they have the power to remove you from the session. For a company like Rockstar, this is unacceptable."
really good game ngl
It's fun game. Sometimes it can be painful
Great game. I can do whatever I want that is not possible in real life. I can go guns blazing and get away with it. Fun to play with friends who has the same vibes as you are. Super recommended.

"Amazing single player and online can be really fun. But through repetitive missions, cheaters crashing your home internet and reduced support from rockstar such as removing almost 200 vehicles! Its just not worth it."
GRAND THEFT AUTO BABYYYY
Have you ever tried shooting the missiles at the people on the flying bikes? Great sport here in America.

I've only played the story mode and it was amazing. It really shows who you stand with. The amount of missions and details  is extraordinary. The endings feel a bit forces as you just maker one decision for them but they are all equally as good. Overall 9/10 very good game.
laggy as all hell
lAGGY GAME
weed farm pretty cool
ktgl
guns = YES
"GTA V being GTA V, grate game"
Good Game is so beautiful
fall to the knees of bonfarius
"I've beaten this game on the 360, xbox, and most of the way on PC. I love GTA as a series and this may be one of my favorite games of all time. However, this port to PC just doesn't feel solid - and if you have any desire to play GTA online, then prepare to be met with a barrage of hackers and the potential to have your account falsely banned."
"Modders are bad, rockstar says they cut down on the hackers and stuff but they ban like 3 people LOL."

slaying game fr
this game is good with the best graphic so download it and enjoy
super recomendo
Siuk game ani
great game. only problem is that most online sessions are full with moders
not bad but be prepared for a massive download :)
It's very fun and easy to get money IF you know what you are doing. Would reccomend
love this game just get's repetitive after a while 10/10
fun but hackers are enoying
This game is fun but the prices for cars and guns is pretty steep making it kinda intimidating for a new player. For pc though it feels like there isnt anybody doing heists or races because i struggle to find any
fun and you can illeaglly kill people
PEW PEW BOO BOO
Game is very easy to follow. Be warned there is lots of inappropriate language and other 18+ matters.
"God some of the fucking nostalgia I get when I play this game. I originally owned it on PS4 but recently bought it on PC. Driving through the city of Los Santos while running people over going 120 MPH, nothing will ever beat it. Jokes aside though, this game has made some of the most memorable and greatest characters in gaming history."
W GAME SO MANY HOT GIRLS IN BIKINIS AT STRIP CLUB  AND LAP DANCE ON TOP
"You only ban players who glitch money but not those who mod the game online, you are a disappointment  rockstar, I loved the previous gta games, but now you are just some greedy old developers who don't givr shit about their fanbase."
"Was good but highly unplayable nowadays.The amount of cheaters is deplorable at best. Along with the amount of times you cant load into lobbies or you just randomly crash, the game is barely a fraction of what it was."
I love GTA there are endless things to do and things to buy.
race car
very good game I personally love it.
I like the kid that smokes weed and jerks off lol
"They removed 200+ cars for PC, and now you have to pay for Xbox + to get access to a show room to actually randomly buy them. And guess what? They are in ridiculous prices. I hate to say it, but the devs are now just about as bad as every phoney company the game tries to portray. You want a car game? This ain't it, chief."
i just fucking got suspended from gta 5 online for no reason and my gta characters will be reset which i have played with for hour and hours to level up
Its fun and addicting but its hard to figure what you are supposed to do. i'm also trying to figure out how to make sure my voice chat is on so wish that was a bit easier  but all and all a pretty good game would recommend spending the 15 bucks
"Really fun game. Would recommend for people who like realistic, shooter, and criminal games."
dwadwadwadawaw
I remember good times before hackers. I can't even log into story mode couse of your poor security. Your support isn't helpful at all and the game after (for me) many hours isn't even loading. Dogshit
"Amazing, played since I was a kid! love it"
"the launcher is a fuckin dipshit. its programmed by a bunch of fucking autistic monkeys, and it doenst work properly. fuck this game"
just play gta6 bro tf
Its a lot of fun but its a lot more fun when you play with friends
Been playing it since 2013 on the PS3
FUCK THIS GAME !1
classico
Its a really good game
"Newest update removed nearly two-hundred already available cars from players who don't have GTA+, the new god awful subscription service from Rockstar. Vote with your wallet and skip this game."
ghffg
I LOVE THIS GAME THIS IS AMAZING
robbing banks very fun
"every online public session is always filled with cheaters/modders it's not very recomended if you're an introverted solo player who has 0 friend unless you're having coop team (but it doesn't matter if the session is plagued by modders anyway)  the Story mode is decent, but the Online mode is meh (especially those chinese f-ing spammer & modders that ruined the game)"
It is very fun and goofy
"Its funny asf, you can do literally everything you want there, recommend this frfr"
cool game i have no frends to play with tho
i like 2 run people over
i like the cars and graphics
Spawn in get griefed Spawn in get caged by modder Spawn in get kicked from the session. Modders in ever session. Overall 10/10 game would recommend.
hdhdd
its a good/amazing thats what i think
ok\
"I visit los santos like it's my hometown. It's shit and full of people that hate you, but I still love it."
"Used to be a blast, Now its loaded with far too many bugs and errors that rockstar refuses to fix such as the infamous ""Initializing"" issue. Fun for single player but if you're expecting a good online experience I'd hold off for a while because it's hardly functional at this point"
i love the shoe tore
I DELIVERED CARGO IN MYU WOREHOUSE AND NOTHING HAPPENS WHEN I GO YELLO CIRCLE I COMPLETED 1 HOURS MISSION AND TRUCK NOT HO IN MY WOREHOUSE FUCK THIS GAME
Awful port w/ endless loading timeouts.
great exp
LUVLY
I became a Japanese kamikaze pilot
Below average.
very good a lot
pay to win but with mods its good i guess
pretty good game fun to play with friends if someones reading this to convince their parents to buy it there isnt much bad with it and the online version is pretty much a hangout where you can collect cars and do things with your friends like tennis and arm wrestling. if this worked for anyone leave a comment im curious
GOOD TIME PASS GAME.

i was molestead by an oppressor and a lazer jet and i just slammed my monitor all thanks to u
people buy this game to pay fivem
"I did not enjoy Grand Theft Auto V.  Played for 45 hours, reached 25% completion. For me, this was simply hard work.  The graphics quality is amazing if compared with GTA San-Andreas. The depth of all the crazy characters and the scope of the map is epic. (Seems good so far?!?)  But the game-play in each ""mission"" is mundane silly shooting or driving or pointing things at other things. And the complexity of the controls ... (I am using an Xbox360 controller with the game running on a Windows PC) ... are completely confusing, overwhelming, and the functions of buttons and sticks keeps changing in bizarre ways when you move from being on foot to driving to flying, and all sorts of other special activities.  In summary, I don't think this is really a ""game"". It is more like watching a mashup of Adventure Films, TV soap operas, Soft Porn, Reality TV programs, and Art movies - but, instead of simply watching the films, the""player"" is constantly being told to press some buttons and tilt some joystics in a rather moronic fashion.  I found it very difficult to find the right buttons or joysticks or D-pad controls in each situation, and to read the instructions popping up on screen and then vanishing, and to control the gun / camera / car / etc with the required accuracy and speed, And all for what purpose? Just so the plot of the GTA V ""film"" (that is called ""Story Mode"" in GTA V) can proceed. No thank-you.  There are so many controls, and so many overlapping control actions, that some of the actions involve holding certain buttons whilst pressing other buttons in a strictly timed sequence. If you do the button convolutions wrong in sequence or in timing then it just does something different - not what is needed. Near impossible for me to sort all that out when in the heat of battle against opposing ground and air forces - and needing to switch between three different player characters - all in the same helicopter!  Go to ""Ammunation"" gun ranges to practise shooting? No good. The shooting controls are different when in the gun range from those in the real world. I could not pass the first round of anything in the gun ranges.  The only player-controlled activity that I enjoyed in this game was to take a cross-country motorbike ride out over the hills to the coast, and take a swim in the ocean. For that activity there are simple controls, great graphics, and all at the player's own choice and control. But that activity is nothing to do with the ""missions"" of the game.  After playing for three weeks I uninstalled the game. I am glad I saw the graphics on a 2K PC monitor. Apart from that one pleasure I regard the experience as a waste of my money and a waste of my time."
"This is good,when you cheat"
i have never had a better experience than this game
Fun to mess about in. Loved it even though I only have 59 hours!
i get to live out my dreams without getting put on a federal watchlist its great
bro..      It's GTA V.
This game sucks and I don't like it.

"Newest mercenary update just removed 186 VEHICLES from the game, all just to push people to buy their GTA+ subscription which isn't even available for previous gen or PC so they just removed content for no reason"
"this game turned me into a psychopath, 10/10"
this game has kept me entertained and has done really good for me in boring times

"""Traffic Jams? Nah, We Create Traffic Symphony!"" 🚦🎶 Who needs boring commutes when you can orchestrate chaos on the streets of Los Santos? Whether you're causing a 50-car pileup or driving a tank through rush hour, traffic has never been this entertaining. Join us and become the ultimate conductor of automotive mayhem"
MUST TRY GAME EVEN IN 2023!!
you all know the best game ever so no comment required
its balls and my balls itch from playing it
Do I need to say anyhting? Its awesome - one of the best out there.
grind never stop
the game is brilliant
"Oh boy, where do I even begin with GTA V? It's like strapping yourself into a rocket-powered roller coaster that takes you on a thrill ride you never wanted to end! Here's my hilariously chaotic review of this insane game:  First off, let's talk about the story. It's like a crazy mashup of a Hollywood blockbuster, a soap opera, and a fever dream. You've got three protagonists: Michael, the retired bank robber who can't resist one last score; Franklin, the street-smart hustler with dreams of making it big; and Trevor, the absolute madman who's so unpredictable, you'll question your own sanity just by being in the same virtual universe as him. These characters are so outlandishly entertaining that you'll find yourself cheering for the bad guys and laughing maniacally at their ridiculous antics.The world of Los Santos is a sprawling playground of mayhem and debauchery. Want to go skydiving? Sure, why not! Feel like taking a leisurely drive through the city? Good luck avoiding the inevitable car crash or pedestrian pile-up because, let's be honest, following traffic rules is for boring people. And don't even get me started on the police chases. Nothing beats stealing a cop car, causing utter chaos, and then escaping by the skin of your teeth, all while laughing manically at the sheer absurdity of it all."
the game is alright if you like open world
love driving over old ladys
I've lost my virginity in this game. Love it!
so true
it w0ont let me gift it
pure autism
"As an open action adventure game in a virtual world, GTA 5 is undoubtedly a very good game.  It offers a huge game world with a rich variety of missions and activities, full of excitement and challenges.   First of all, the game screen of GTA 5 is very exquisite, and the details are handled very well.  Whether it is city buildings, vehicle models or character movements, it all gives people a realistic feeling.  At the same time, the sound effects and soundtrack of the game are also very good, which can enhance the atmosphere and immersion of the game.   Secondly, the plot of GTA 5 is very exciting, full of suspense, excitement and surprises.  Players can play different roles and experience different story lines, which makes the game more attractive and deep.   In addition, GTA 5 also provides a variety of game content and activities.  Players can freely explore the game world, drive various vehicles, participate in various tasks and challenges, and can also play online multiplayer games with other players.  These diverse ways of playing make the game more fun."
"Good game, when your in a lobby without hackers"
"However it's old,best in the market."
i want to butt fuck Lester!!!!
"Imagine having a game for years, then out of no where, the developer 'removes' content only to put it behind a paywall."
it will not get better after the first 300 hours
game let me dog pet

how do i find my steam screenshots
just great
"The story and all that is amazing, very fun games, but the main reason most people have more than 100 hours in this game is GTA Online.  The average newbie GTA Online experience:  Start game, constantly get blown up by Oppressors. Don't boot the game up for 3 months till a friend is hyperfixated and wants someone in their crew. Get addicted for 100 hours, afford nice cars, new heists, ect. Turn off for about 2 more months till the same thing happens. Get addicted again, finally buy an Oppressor, blow up the assholes who fuck with newbies.  This game sucks, 10/10"
Clarly the best game i've ever plaied
one of the best games i played real
"The ultimate destination where my criminal genius goes hand in hand with parallel parking failures, soaring virtual success, plummeting real-life achievements, and problem-solving through epic high-speed crashes!"
good game. if you dont want to run into hackers and still want to enjoy the game no worries just initiate a solo instance past that good community and fun
It's gud.

Removed 180+ vehicles in one update and placed them behind a console exclusive paywall. R* somehow always manage to find new ways of being greedy.

"The Game wont even laubch.. I bought this game and got to play it once.. Have tried every way possible to fix it & cant find a single solution... oh and cant be refunded because i have ""more than 2 hours of game play."" Which is crap because steam tells me the game is running but never actually launches.. Disappointed to say the LEAST!!"

"The story mode is a blast. With online unless you have friends you have to do heists with randoms and you always get stuck with some idiot that screws up the heist or leaves midway through. The updates have been sucking the past year with the most recent one removing more content than it adds. Furthermore, if you want any of the cool cars the game has to offer you either have to use mods or make grinding the aforementioned heists a second job. Buy it on sale for the story mode and maybe have some fun with friends online. Also never buy Shark Cards, they completely ruined online."
Maybe when the yes and then he says no but then he says yes this game is fun and good so maybe you buy it cause that man right there said its a good game you know? 👍 😕 ???
caca
Me personally I love gta I recommend
this game is good but also so ass you got to deal with hackers fucking with you mark 2s and then the retarded ass loading screens that dont work 90% of the time
The rockstar launcher makes this game literally unplayable. I moved computers and now it won't let me play the game I paid for. Awful company with awful practices.
"When i played the game, i said ""im not playing Trevor"" then Trevor broke in my house and stole all my Nfl josh allen cards."
funny shootihng game
its fun tp
Very funny game much love taught me to commit crimes
When will Rockstar realize that crossplatform is a gold mine? smh
I love the game I just wished it would have more Interesting easter eggs to explore like scary ones & ones that do actually attack you would be very fun to be honest but overall it needs lots of new features.
veru
i spend 600 hours of my life and get banned thanks rockstar games i hope the money i paid goes for your medic
Great game to blow off steam with a replayable story
Has Strip Club (BEST GAME)
the game  fun at the but sad at the end
Gay
so much to do
its just too fun to stop playing!!!
"fuck this fucking game, the fucking delay is the worst im not even going to say how BAD is the movement 2 FUCKING SECONDS AND THEN THEN AFTER 2 MOTHERFUCKING SECONDS IT REGISTERS"
very friendly game it is even bettre when ur playing with ur family at the gathering. the casino is the best place to spend ur time.... and money but it is an equal trade
very good game. if any parents are wondering this game is not really that harsh and if youre worried about the blood there is nearly nothing only close up angles can be bloody.
its amazing and has changed my life if only i could use it on a better pc.
YEA
Its a good game but i want my money back lol good game tho 100%
"You could play this game for years and suddenly find that the Launcher stops working because someone managed to link your Steam ID to their social club account without ever compromising either your rockstar account or steam account.  Rockstar support is abysmal for helping.  Buyer Beware, you risk losing everything tied to R* if you purchase on PC."

very much would recommend! one of the best games ever made.

"although no one talks about the story mode is quite good, so is online if you have friends to have fun with. The ingame things to buy are insanely expensive to the point where you can not grind your way to them. The missions are fun to do with friends tho"

"I have owned this game since October of 2015. I have played this game, with the same two characters, on XBox 360, XBox One, and then migrated to PC. I have invested well over 3000 hours into this game. Needless to say, it was for a very long time one of my favorites, if not my favorite. For over a span of one year, it was the only game I played.  With the most recent actions of Rockstar, by removing vehicles we have not only grinded for, but some of us had literally paid for, to place them behind a subscription pay-wall, I am uninstalling this game. For nearly a decade, GTAV has been a staple in my gaming collection. No more. No longer can I condone what Rockstar has done to it's player base. No more can I sit idly by and ignore the grift. No more will I allow this complete and wholesale abuse by a publisher to continue.  No. More.  Goodbye Rockstar. Thnks fr th mmrs."
The story is good.  The multiplayer just got worse.

Greed is not good.
one word: CarGoBRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
best game ever... only for story mode
"On second day of playing online, social club acc got hacked"
gta 5 is actually the best game ever made its fun has a lot of fun missions and its just to easy to play
online is nice
"I remember I delete the game , full of mod panel user online ruining the game , plus unistallit maybe finally they will relase a new title insted to milk this old cow"
lots of titties
it is fun and amazing gameplay but alittle laggy
mantab coy
"There are so many bugs you encounter every day that the game leaves you fuming after every session, and all these bugs are so very frequent like almost every session you would face multiple of such issues. Some of them are: A lot of times during missions you would get in your car but it wouldn't move. You are trying to enter a getaway vehicle during a mission as passenger and you would get stuck at the car door and not because the owner have not granted permission, the door would open but you would not be able to enter. During latest mercenaries update while doing charlie mission you would engage autopilot in your avenger but would not be able to enter the cockpit again.(There are so many bugs that listing them here would not make sense, go read a subreddit and you would know what I'm talking about) It usually takes forever to be able to join a public lobby and out of nowhere you are alone in the session, even when upnp is on and the nat settings are at moderate. The money aspect of the is also focused on selling shark cards, so most of the time you would spend on grinding for money. I fell in love with GTA when I first played San Andreas but GTA V online is not really the most alluring aspect for me, love the story missions though."
haha 69
"who doesnt like driving recklessly and killing people with a chance to respawn. Jokes Aside, gta has an amazing storyline and it has many features that can make the game limitless."
yeah ok
"I watched Bigfoot climb into a jet-pack to then ram into a telephone pole and explode, makes up for every black screen and moder in the game"
I like ruining ppls days with a sniper.  10/10
"Ever since GTA as a franchise came out just like the submarine ""Titan"" it really blew up."
"Rockstar want MORE money, they do not care about players. Add more subscription and ur company WILL bankrupt in near future. Save your money. Do not support what Rockstar has become. Rockstar, do u really want to create GAMES or u became just another sh*t company that cares about subscriptions and business model???"
Give us the same updates as console :(
You can make the money that you can't in real life
"Very fun to play with friends, and enjoyable"
strimp culb
sperma
rockstar turned a 1 time sale game into a subscription service for a huge portion of the in-game cars.   i'm never playing this again.
Save your money.  Do not support what Rockstar has become.
i like the strip club
I LIKE THIS GAME SO MUCH
"[h1] Review #31 [/h1] [b] Brief: [/b] Important thing I want to note first is that I am giving this a positive review purely for the Story Mode/Singleplayer Campaign. The storytelling was really great, visuals were great, combat was randomly good or bad due to how wacky the A.I likes to be, which can make for some funny moments too though. Other than that, GTA Online has, for me personally, lost its value over time but that also could just be that now I've grown up and the desires to play this game when I was younger have faded away. So, overall, I recommend this game if you are purely interested in the singleplayer part of it.  [u] Positives [/u] [list]     [*] Great singleplayer story (Fantastic characters and visuals)     [*] Huge map to explore around     [*] The driving mechanics feel great as well, as well as there are a huge variety of vehicles out there to drive/find     [*] Achievements (though there was also GTA Online achievements so getting them all is a pain mostly)  [/list] [u] Negatives [/u] [list]     [*] My experiences with the combat in this game have been between good and bad. Sometimes the A.I works just fine, sometimes they can be dumb, though this can make funny moments too. Especially cop car A.I.     [*] (Regarding GTA Online): Without friends I don't see this being much fun, especially considering if you wish to even try doing most of the heists, you need 4 people regardless. Then to mention, random lobbies in GTA Online can have lots of cheaters/hackers, whatever you wanna call them. Or just downright annoying people on a flying motorbike with rockets that wont let you put even a toe outside where you live without being eradicated from Los Santos.     [*] (Regarding GTA Online): Now I have no idea why they thought making enemies bullet sponges when selecting a harder difficulty for 1.5x reward was a good idea for making it harder. Yes, it does make it harder, by just making it more annoying and less fun to play. I cant believe you can shoot some of these enemies in the face multiple times and they just get right back up. Unless everyone is the Terminator, I don't understand why they absorb bullets. [/list] [i] ""I'm not gonna tell you if you should buy it though, that's up to you to decide, I just provide my positive and negative experiences"" - wamcrash [/i]"
the game play is over all okay it is nothing to be impressed by but if you are looking for something to pass the time GTA 5 is an okay choice. but the story is just meh. the controls and physics are weird. for me this game is a 3/10
Great game to experience virtual world play and other personal settings
Best game Ever !!!!!!!
very good but a little old
"They just deleted my Social club making me unable to even turn it on, worst piece of shit I've ever played."
NIce
Very good very nice game
its fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun i have a proplem i have played it in one day
Fucking subscription models bro
"i dont like paid subscriptions, bring back the cars"
"Good game! Wondering when the 6th game will be out, maybe by the end of this century!"
this game has been out for a long time  now but even as of now this game is still as good as it was when it was first released
"GTA V story mode is 10/10.  GTA online. im personaly having so much fun in the game, nice car, nice businesses, nice story. there is a lot of grief-er and modder in the game but i dont mind, I still enojy it till today."
Removed over 100 cars from the game.
"When you grind the game a lot you will probably get bored with it and at times its boring to do all the same things all the time just to make money and too many cheaters that destroy other people's experience but rockstar wont make a solution to get rid of them our best way of getting rid of cheaters is hop in a private/solo session but sometimes it just doesn't work and the cheaters could still get in and when you've played the game a lot and have a lot of money the game just doesn't seem fun anymore, but over all its actually a good game it can be fun its just at times there is something or someone that could destroy that fun."
good. but lots of hackers
Loved the game since the day it announced! and the story goes brrrrrrrrrr
Glad to finally have it on PC
"none of the bundle items were on my account soooooo refunded, apparently that's a problem with other people too so just get the cheapest version of the game. no matter how good the summer sale is :( still an amazing game just rating it bad so maybe more people see it and don't waist money on content they're not gonna get."
"Red Dead is better,but still amazing"
i cant open my game why?????????
Boobies Hehe
They removed cars from the game you could buy with in-game currency and put them up on a console only subscription and now you have to also pay IRL money for them.  What a fuckin joke of a company and game.
amazing game ngl!!!
really fun but they need to add more cars:)
very good veeeeeeeeeeeeeery good
There's a lot of fun to be had in the game but the old publisher greed chestnut is rendering it harder and harder. Now that they decided to be true to the game's name and lock a huge amount of previously free content behind a goddamn subscription I found the pitiful remnants of my self-respect and decided to quit. Don't give these people money. That's how this behaviour is normalised and validated.
DADDY
"really great game strippers, drugs, guns, what else can u ask for~"
LOVELY JUST LOVELY
"Hey, Tony!!!"
The game good and all but the control on pc are so bad. you litteraly cant take off on water plane wich is a problem for some mission like and the helicopters are barely driveba;

I LIKE THE CARS AND BEATING UP CIVILIANS 10/10
i need mods
JANCOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
"A game where you steal stuff and have fun.  Now with the new update they can steal from you too! It's so immersive and realistic. The game store page should say ""rent"" now rather than ""buy now"""
Fr the best game lol
good geam i swear
verry good it has very good options to play i have played 50 hour and im so interested  of this game it has goood graphics options. And big + for me is : I love open world games
"I'm gay tony, and I'm back"
moding
"Its gtav you know what it is,im just writing this so steam fucks off asking me 2."
i like the online play where you can link with your friends and do co-op missions and just run around
whopper whopper whopper a stick in my big stopper
how to online
Tasted Good
Turned a good game into a money grabbing piece of crap.
good fr
HDFDH
not a jump scare game
Not that bad
"For a game about stealing cars, you'd think the driving controls might be a little more fluid than riding your rollerblades down an ice rink covered in butter. Also the dialogue sounds like it was written by a white guy who was ECSTATIC for his chance to repeatedly write a word that Steam might decide I don't need to be here anymore if I'm more clear. I'm just hitting highlights, but in just in general, his game aged like milk in the sun, I have no idea how they're monetizing it so heavily in its state."
Way better on PC.
the hookers are nice
gta 6  needa drop asap
"The amount of work put into this game is outright phenomenal. This game gives you a feeling of reality and emotions during the interactions of characters. A really, really good game, an all time favorite"
i dislike that theres not a mode for gta rp
MANTGEPP
nyc pic dear
Good soup
w game fr fr
bruh this game made me it birthed me raised me and broke me all within less than 2 hours
This is GTA <3
"You.. i keep coming back so i guess that's something lol, but in all seriousness, the whole reason i stopped playing last year was bc i was tired of griefing, i found out rockstar now lets you run businesses in invite only sessions.... and i love it... i can now grind in peace and rp in peace lol. They also added a acid lab for the new business, and i gotta say rockstar did a phenomenal job on that new business"
cfvthg
"Updates are supposed to add content to a game, not take it away and lock it behind a paywall. Fuck you Rockstar. Make a new game and stop beating a dead horse, you corporate whores."
just don't
i Just purchase this game a few days ago and im not able to play cause my activation key is already being used apperently??? is there  a way to fix this so  i can play this game??
IT IS GOOD:)
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
who doesnt like gta?
I LIKED Everything ! JUST PLAY IT !
it gay
"Hiding purchased content, behind a subscription? LOOOL. From the studio that couldnt figure out how to fix load times."
"Very fun, love the strip club!"
AMAZING GAME!!
"Im Sorry Mr Rubio, From Stealing You 100th Time"
"very realistic, good story, worth the purchase"
my rockstar account got hacked and i cant login
im special ed
love this game but this last update completely threw me when you realized they pulled almost 200 vehicles from the online to add another dlc...we get it its packed and no more room but dang i hope the give us some news on September 17 2023 with it being the ten year anniversary...we need the 6th
truly one of the games of all time
Removed alot of cars and put them behind a subscription paywall plus the constant hackers. Going to have to not recommend any Rockstar games if this is path they are taking.
Great game cant wait for 6
"A very fun game you can play it with friends and even make friends. sadly my old steam account was hacked and i lost everything but starting over is so much more fun then i remembered it being. There are four types of people in this game. 1, The mean modder who makes everyones day worse. 2, the nice modder who makes people laugh or rich. 3, the greiffer, do i even need to explain this one. 4, the casual player who is either quiet and just doing their own thing or talking making friends and having fun. All in all this is a very good game and i suggest getting it."
fuck this studio. They went full greedy assholes.
SUPER FUN
i like gta 5 online and story mission
monkey game
nice game super fun
bob think it be good
i dont like gta 5 online or offline mode. just am playing grand rp roleplay is best server be like real life

it was cool
fivem awesome
"This is primarily about Online, but first:  GTA V Singleplayer:  Pretty damn good, story is great and the characters are all solid. If you're just getting it for singleplayer, just pretend this review is positive. I recommend it a lot.  GTA Online: Can be fun, and isn't all that difficult to make money solo or with friends anymore (thank you private lobbies for letting us finally sell business stock), but removing 180+ vehicles just ain't it. I would have recommended it before the current update only if you don't mind grinding, but now there isn't much to grind for."
The latest update to the multiplayer removed many cars and put them behind a monthly paywall!
"Hours of fun. You can pick multiple variations, and p;lay the game differently"
its insane bro u hav to cop
i love shooting nigger with glock on the streets
"Haven't ran into a single person who wasn't hacking. Ridiculous. Save your money, not even worth it with the summer sale."
Fun...
shoe store  on top!
"Fantastic and iconic game. Not much to say about it. However I find the Rockstar Games Launcher to incredibly difficult at times, taking several tries with the same password to login and having instances where it crashes the game all together. Wish you could start the game without the Rockstar games launcher."
its a good and fun game come try if you like
i love getting blown up while doing a setup

the game lost its charm when they added pointless futuristic overpowered pay to win vehicles like the oppressor MK II and now they are removing content from the game that players already payed for and putting it behind a subscription truly disgusting
Really good game if you can take it as what its meant to be which is satire and very funny too. Sure it can be a bit weird and uncomfortable sometimes but that just makes it interesting to see what wacky things happen next in my opinion. Also very good small details that I never noticed until this time playing like there is lots of well placed hidden dialogue within phone you can pull up by calling your in game contacts without it being an objective and the different story development in story mode in general is amazingly well written.
"GTA, one of the best games ever made"
"Vintage chocolate chip cookies  Ingredients 150g salted butter, softened 80g light brown muscovado sugar 80g granulated sugar 2 tsp vanilla extract 1 large egg 225g plain flour ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda ¼ tsp salt 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks Method STEP 1 Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.  STEP 2 Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.  STEP 3 Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.  STEP 4 Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.  STEP 5 Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.  STEP 6 Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.  STEP 7 Bake for 8–10 mins until they are light brown on the edges and still slightly soft in the centre if you press them.  STEP 8 Leave on the tray for a couple of mins to set and then lift onto a cooling rack.  RECIPE TIPS FREEZING THE BISCUITS If you’ve frozen the biscuits, take them out and arrange them on a lined baking sheet. Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out. STORING DOUGH You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking"

Pretty good game for price and story but very expensive vehicles and low cuts in heists and low payout looks like everything is pay to win. Thanks Rockstar games
"[b]Single Player Review:[/b]  It's hard to believe that this game launched a decade ago, was built to run on machines with as little as 512 MB of RAM, a very optimized title, and was, most importantly, the most successful entertainment product in history, surpassing other games, movies, and music in revenue. With a very engrossing story that expands the concept of multiple protagonists and points of view, this blockbuster of a game will make you feel like you're in a truly Hollywoodian story. With all the pop culture references, all satirizing the American way of life, the game utilizes heavy scripting to trick you into thinking the engine is way more powerful than it really is. Talking about mechanics, [i]GTA[/i] is a dichotomy: while the car handling is very Arcade, the game takes into consideration the number of occupants in the car for handling, so this is very much a design choice. Unfortunately, the top speeds are very limited due to loading, and breaking and acceleration are greatly exaggerated. All this makes driving for hours in a city grid very relaxing, different from the predecessor, [i]GTA IV[/i], which was more like a simulator. While being a car game and a crime simulator makes all sense since you can try out any car you like, still owning and keeping collections in single-player is pretty flawed. We are talking about a game full of personality that feels alive, from the protagonists, NPCs, cars, and even the city. You will never see a sunset like others after thousands and thousands of hours of playing. This game survived three generations of consoles and almost a decade and made a challenge to Rockstar: how can you make a sequence for a title like [i]GTA V[/i]?  [b]Multi-Player Review:[/b]  GTA multi-player was not the focus of the developers at Rockstar at the start; it was more like a parallel project using the game assets to build another game that would add value to the overall experience. With not a lot of activities and glitches, the multiplayer start was bumpy back in 2013, but with free DLC after free DLC, the game started getting more and more content, ranging from new vehicles to new missions. [i]The Heists update[/i] introduced a single-player-quality narrative and story online in 2015. With the addition of being a CEO or Motorcycle gang leader in: [i]Further Adventures in Finance and Felony[/i] and [i]Bikers[/i] DLCs in 2016, GTA turned into a full MMOish experience, with stock in warehouses and drugs in your factories being built and persisting over time. At the same time, we started seeing the rise in the price of content go along with methods to make money as a way to incentivize microtransactions. with each DLC trying to top the one before. In 2017, we reached the peak of megalomania with flying cars and bikes and satellites with orbital laser strikes with The [i]Doomsday Heist[/i], and since the negative feedback, Rockstar has been dialing back on this type of content. In 2019, we had a new location, [i]The Diamond Casino & Resort[/i], featuring later on [i]The Diamond Heist[/i]. In 2020, Rockstar launched the biggest update with [i]The Cayo Perico Heist[/i], featuring top-quality content, ways of making money, and a whole new island. In 2021, we had a Fast & Furious-inspired update with [i]Los Santos Tuners[/i] and a later one featuring Dr. Dre and Franklin Clinton from the single-player story in [i]The Contract[/i], with each update being shaped more and more by community feedback. With cars resembling more real ones, we see a spike in prices and anti-consumer practices as the PC version of the game still has not received the Next Generation upgrade to boost sales on these consoles.  One of the building blocks of one of the most successful role-playing mods that dominates [i]Twitch[/i], [i]GTA Online[/i], has been the target of controversy when the developers try to shut down FiveM. With the excuse to battle Cheating, a battle that had been lost, and almost making me give this game a negative review, the peer-to-peer network structure where GTA Online is built and relies on does not give any security against cheating and modding, and the game is not built to take security factors into account, as well as not having a real anti-cheat system and some simple scripts that can be bypassed. So at any time, you can see your progress destroyed, and the fact that some people try to push the agenda that cheating in GTA is somewhat acceptable only makes the problem worse.  At some point in time ([i]some of these problems have been fixed, others have been partialy fixed[/i]), cheaters could: Set themselves in god mode, use aimbots or auto-aim in free aim sessions, use ESPs and have every information about you, teleport themselves anywhere in the map, teleport you, give you money, [strike]take money from you through the insurance system[/strike], freeze you in place, stick objects on your character or vehicle, spawn explosions on every player in the session, [strike]spawn explosions on players and make look like it was other player that have done it in the kill feed (framing)[/strike], [strike]change their RSC nick name for players inside a session[/strike], softlock missions, modify the damage of any given weapon, give you weapons, [strike]remove your weapons[/strike], prevent you from being a CEO/Biker leader, eject you from your vehicle, give bad sport points that at some point send you to a session with other bad sport players, remove reports given to them, kick you from your session, [strike]get inside your private session[/strike], [strike]leak of your IP and location[/strike], [strike]corrupt your Online save file[/strike], [strike]control de weather sessionwide[/strike], crash your game; and the list goes on."
Its super duper
Open-world and The guns and Vehicles
Terrible controls
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
I love this game so much
to childish
"Its GTA cmon, of course id recomend it. Is it broken, yes. Do i still love the hell out of this broken game? 100% probably will play this untill the day gta 6 comes out lets be real. ive owned it on 360, PS3, Xbox One and series. bascially if you have friends get it, if you dont, get it anyway and make some."
kill the bitches
"After having played for over 200 hours of GTAV on PC, let alone the countless amount of hours I have also played on PS3, Xbox 360, PS4 Pro, and Xbox Series X and S, I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that is as close to a real life simulator as you can get, as you can do a countless number of different things all throughout los santos, from robbing gas stations to buying and selling stocks and other things along with completing tasks and missions. I absolutely love this game, and I love the fact now that I can run it in 4K at over 140 FPS with a Ryzen 9 5950x and a RTX 4090. Absolutely stunning eye candy. It makes the game that much more enjoyable of an experience. The fact that it has been on sale a bunch as well makes it that much more of a deal. Between this game and Red Dead Redemption 2, these are my two favorite games from Rockstar as of today writing this review for everyone. Definitely give this game and Red Dead 2 a chance since both of them are on sale majority of the time and the gameplay is impressive, it will not disappoint you, especially if you are running a top of the line PC as I am. You definitely cannot go wrong with this game. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do."
this game has given me more pain than getting kicked in the balls
very good game. i love the part where i can commit war crimes without being hunted down by the fbi
GET ER DUNNN

"I like the game but I did a mission and after a mission I couldn't find my Deluxo in any of my garages, Insurance didn't have it and it wasn't in the impound lot. I searched for 4 hours and I didn't find it until I was going to contact Rockstar Support, but that didn't work either because I couldn't login into my Social Club so I said screw it and went to bed. Then the next day I woke up and it was in my garage with no upgrades. (I have Dementia and Schizophrenia)"
i love killing hookers<3
"This is an amazing game, especially with mods."
O_O
super fun game
it is the best game out there but sometimes if your playing on pc the game lags
i love the game :)
I love this game! It has a very good story to it and the online is very unique online platform. I'm glad I bought it and definitely recommend it/ The graphics in this game are also just amazing.
i like the prices of things and the way you get guns and fight is epic combat rating 9/10
fivem e forta
shittiest game ever
swag very cool
"Boys help me out, my wife said if I get 100 likes and 20 awards, she’ll buy me a new PC with a RTX 4070ti and a crate of beer this is NOT A JOKE!!!"
pretty fun.

I've never seen a gaming company that is so generous and just look on with modders and abusers.  It's a garbage game and a garbage company. I sincerely hope GTA6 and Rockstar are flop.
It's GTA 5. If Steam used a star system tho I'd knock it down like 2 stars for the godawful online.
"Too many modders trying to give you non solicited cash, risking your account from being restarted or banned/suspended."
AWESOME  NOTHING TO SAY
Great value after all this years

"Grand Theft Auto V [10/10] (2015) R* created another huge & beautiful open world with amazing attention to detail that can't be described in few words. Awesome graphics, great storytelling with 3 protagonists. Shooting, driving, flying everything improved & so many things to do created with such perfection 🙂"
"This game is a mix of aim bot AI enemies, that'll strip you down quicker than ur uncle and hackers that'll spawn UFO's ontop of you. Fun to play drunk tho once you get the hang of it and lose all self-respect for your mental health <3"
"Greatest heist game ever, I recommend you to play it."
loved it hated it then loved it again
i love the graphics and the engine of the game.
"I find it idiotic that you have to wait a week before access to dlc you bought, also the fact they decided to remove over 100 cars from purchase, most of which is only accessible there."
very very nice game
"this game can be played anytime, either you are in school or home you can always play with your friends"
it would be good but theres to many hackers
it is a very good game yes
the game sucks ass
"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is a masterpiece that sets the bar high for open-world action-adventure games. From the moment you step foot into the sprawling fictional city of Los Santos, you are transported into a meticulously crafted world filled with endless possibilities and exhilarating gameplay.  The attention to detail in GTA V is astounding. The graphics are stunning, with vibrant visuals that bring the city to life. The sprawling landscapes, bustling streets, and dynamic weather effects create a truly immersive experience. Whether it's driving through the winding roads of the countryside or exploring the bustling urban metropolis, every corner of Los Santos feels alive and vibrant.  The gameplay mechanics are polished and refined, offering a seamless blend of shooting, driving, and exploration. The missions and quests are incredibly diverse, providing a perfect balance between intense action sequences, thrilling heists, and engaging storylines. The three playable protagonists bring a unique twist to the game, offering distinct perspectives and adding depth to the narrative.  One of the standout features of GTA V is the online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online. It offers an expansive open-world playground where you can team up with friends or engage in thrilling competitive challenges. The constant updates and additions to the multiplayer mode ensure that there's always something new and exciting to explore.  Beyond the gameplay, GTA V boasts a captivating and well-written story. The characters are richly developed, with complex motivations and intertwining narratives. The voice acting is top-notch, immersing you further into the lives and struggles of these characters.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a true gem in the gaming industry. It combines breathtaking visuals, immersive gameplay, a compelling storyline, and a thriving online multiplayer experience. Rockstar Games has crafted a game that captivates players for countless hours, providing an unparalleled level of entertainment. Whether you're a fan of action-adventure games or simply looking for an unforgettable gaming experience, GTA V is an absolute must-play."

"It's GTA V. It's a fun game, but after Rockstar removed most of the anti-cheat earlier this year there's waaayy too many cheaters trying to get you banned... Worth to buy on sale."
"To put things very simply, The game can be a fun time with friends. You can have private lobbies now and grind for cash and still have a ton of content or run from the cops with a friend for the nostalgia. However, there is no anti cheat and it's BAAAAD. People can rip your IP, kick you out of a lobby, teleport trap you, explode you, etc. This has been going on for a couple years now and getting worse and Rockstar has not addressed it, despite doing weekly updates and pushing content. They recently took over half the vehicles off the in game store that you can by with the in game currency, and put them behind a paywall you need to use real world money for. It's just not worth it and not worth spending money on for such a crappy experience. Between Red Dead 2 getting no love, and how they're going to try to mine us for money in GTA6 I'm not going to bother with many Rockstar games from here on out. They can't even provide a fair and safe online experience in their most popular game and would rather use it to nickle and dime their audience."

"Rockstar Games and Steam needs to do a lot more to weed out hackers and ban them for life. The game is seriously compromised and the cache on my computer needs to be cleared after hackers go on a rampage harrassing users playing online. If banning accounts doesn't work then start banning credit cards, or entire regions such as China if need be. I get it that hackers will always find some kind of loophole, but PLEASE do more to rid the game of them."
For sure fun game to play! story and online mode just GREAT

"Hello Rockstar, I really like what you did, in every kind of thing of this game is wonderfull, there is just one thing, in GTA V online, it is nearly impossible to find a Lobby without any cheaters, Modders, or even Hackers, I just got killed once again and spawnkilled by a Cheater, the thing is, this game is really cheap, so the modders dont really care about a ban, my opinion is that this game maybe gets a higher price, so it hurts if you have to pay more and more for each unecessary ban, for like maybe 25€. The game is cool, but there are still people which are ruining all the fun in the game."
good game very nicely made still waiting for gta 6 tho
this shit fun asf
what a time
With mods it's amazing
mmm ver gud
"if you are looking for a review about the hackers in every lobby or the crashing or endless loading times/being forced to restart your computer, read other reviews.   i have hundreds of dollars into this game and now i need to log into my rockstar account to play the game i already own. i used FB to log into rockstar so unless i can access an email account from 15 years ago, i cant play."

All the love of freedom and lawlessness is just a shell of what it once was. the game is toxic and so are the remaining players. if you miss that experience from the OG days FiveM is the answer. no default story but you can certainly make your own

"The Eiffel Tower can be 15 cm taller during the summer, due to thermal expansion meaning the iron heats up, the particles gain kinetic energy and take up more space so taking into to the polarity of the sun compared to the nearest black hole you get GTA well if you factor in how £2 is nothing on Mars and £1.093648 on Uranus you get how good GTA is and I think it’s in between the temperature of frozen and lukewarm."
terrible always crashes and freezes takes ages to load.
Relaxing and good made game
gun go pew pew :)
i like it but for some reason i have no audio  anyone know what to do

"Rockstar is still waging a technically illegal war against mods. Look up Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo of America, Inc. And to be blunt, the game has become stale without mods. GTA Online is also stale being filled with repetitive boring content. We need Rockstar and Take 2 to back off the modding community and release a new game that isn't broken."
its just like real life but instead you can live that life you always wanted
rockstar classic
buggy as fuck
i like trhis game but i cant get pass the start part cuase its so laggy

"TLDR: Game's trash, Online carries trashier business model. - It's not even worth 10yo chewed bubblegum. I'd steer clear from R* at all times. (RDR2 is another disappointment, better than GTA V, but still bad)  Game's a carrot to hook you into Online - all of the sandboxing elements that made free-roam in single player any good were stripped or at bare minimum downgraded into virtual uselessness... There's no sandboxing to be found other than some scarce robberies that give close to nothing in terms of rewards, and do not raise any interesting gameplay aspects.  Story's all over the place, doesn't feel entertaining unless the player isn't cultured enough, otherwise it's a filler of cliches that have been told and seen countless times from a wide range of entertainment media (films, games, books, comics). This GTA fails to bring anything substantial and new, the handful of new things they did bring are walled or give as little engaging interaction as possible.  Truth to be told RDR2 surpasses this game in every single aspect, and RDR2 isn't an example of a good entertainment product itself, given it's tailored to milk money from players through online with the story mode also railing and removing a massive spectrum of sandboxing. Both games are handled as corpo greed cash-cows and nothing else.  GTA 5 also lacks any sort of significant updates to fix broken parts of the game, never got any updates to get it closer to completion (a lot of obviously cut content can still be seen), and it's worse on both gameplay and UX when compared to San Andreas. They didn't even bother allowing most things added through updates into Online to be acquired / available in Single Player.  I'd advise to boycott Rockstar until they spill out a faithful (identical in game design and gameplay) remake of San Andreas, until than they should not see a single penny going their way - unfortunately ppl love to throw money at greedy borderline scams, but it'd be the only smart choice - Reason's that to be trusted again, they should bring back something that is trustworthy, we cannot take their word for new games, instead we should demand something we know is good so they can earn said trust back... Regardless, the game's not worth more than 10 bucks in it's entirety, it's the most awful GTA ever made, and I have a feeling that 6 will be much, much worse.  PS: It's also important to note that the Online feature netcode is utter garbage, it's hard to even join any sessions, game gets stuck, there are consistent ""unable to join session"" issues, etc... It works fine for solo play but always glitches out whenever going for any sort of multiplayer content that involves other players... It's also extremely fragile and prone to bugs, loss of progress and almost all of the activities force multiplayer, meaning that to play solo is extremely painful yet the only way to avoid issues with both glitches from R*'s end and cheaters."
wery GOOD game also need a friend to help earn money in onlin (my opinion)i highly recommande it!!!

"Ah, Grand Theft Auto V, the virtual embodiment of mayhem, mischief, and morally questionable life choices. With a collective playtime of 344 hours across all platforms, it's safe to say that I've spent more time indulging in virtual crime than I care to admit. And what a wild, exhilarating, and occasionally infuriating ride it has been.  Let's start with the story, shall we? GTA V offers a narrative that's equal parts dark and humorous, filled with colorful characters and twisted plot twists. From the heists that require careful planning to the random encounters that leave you questioning your own sanity, the story keeps you engaged, even if it occasionally veers into absurdity.  The open-world of Los Santos is a sprawling playground for those with a penchant for chaos. Whether you're cruising the streets in stolen sports cars, wreaking havoc with reckless abandon, or engaging in epic shootouts with the authorities, the sheer freedom of choice is undeniably enticing. Just be prepared for the occasional frustration when the police force seems to have an uncanny ability to teleport right on top of you.  The visuals in GTA V are undeniably impressive. The sunsets casting vibrant hues over the cityscape, the detailed textures of the bustling streets, and the attention to detail in the character models all contribute to creating an immersive and visually stunning experience. It's almost a shame that you're too busy causing chaos to truly appreciate the beauty of it all.  The gameplay mechanics are a mixed bag. On one hand, the shooting mechanics are solid, offering a satisfying blend of precision and chaos. On the other hand, the driving physics can feel like you're piloting a soapbox derby car on a butter-coated racetrack. And let's not forget the joy of being randomly flattened by an AI-controlled vehicle that seems to have no regard for your existence.  GTA Online, the game's multiplayer component, is a chaotic and unpredictable world of its own. It's a realm where everyone fancies themselves as criminal masterminds, engaging in high-stakes heists, and battling it out for supremacy in the streets. Just be prepared for a healthy dose of griefing, overzealous hackers, and the occasional twelve-year-old shouting profanities through their headset.  But amidst the chaos and occasional frustrations, there's a certain undeniable charm to GTA V. It's a game that invites you to unleash your inner anarchist, providing a guilty pleasure in the virtual realm. Whether you're pushing the boundaries of morality or just blowing off steam after a long day, GTA V offers an escape into a world where consequences matter little and mayhem is the order of the day.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a snarky and audacious playground for those who revel in digital anarchy. With its engaging story, visually stunning world, and an abundance of opportunities for mischief, it's no wonder I've spent 344 hours indulging in this virtual life of crime. Just remember to approach it with a healthy dose of irony and a willingness to embrace the chaos. After all, life is too short to always play by the rules."
"Great Game, looking forward to GTA 6"
"good, goofy players but overall fun!"
Yes if you like flying oppressors jacking your cargo and modders being freaks
Fun to commit crimes

"its GTA5. come on now, do I need to say more"
"The online game is a complete waste of time. Full of moronic hackers and cheaters, as well as constant chat spammers. I'm Scottish, and so are Rockstar Games. For a company thats made so much money, its a total mess online and really there is no excuse in the year 2023 for this bullsh*t. Pull your breeks up Rockstar or get out of the gaming genre."
"GTA V is an amazing game. Seriously, it's absolutely incredible! The amount of things you can do in this game is mind-blowing. From the moment you start playing, you'll be hooked, trust me. The game was released back in 2013, but it continues to shine as one of the best games out there, offering an experience that is simply unmatched.  Let's start with the story mode, which offers an engaging narrative that keeps you hooked from start to finish. Without giving away any spoilers, I can assure you that the story is well-crafted, filled with twists and turns that will leave you wanting more. The length of the story mode ensures that you'll be entertained for many hours, providing a rich and immersive experience. Moreover, the diverse cast of main characters adds depth to the narrative, making it all the more enjoyable to play through. Whether you're in the mood for chaos or simply want to partake in some cool activities, GTA V's Director mode allows you the freedom to explore and experiment without constantly worrying about the police.  Moving on to GTA V Online, the multiplayer component of the game, the amount of content and things to do is mind-boggling. Rockstar Games has consistently provided updates and expansions that keep the online world fresh and exciting. You mentioned a few of the activities, such as bunker businesses, nightclub management, and selling special cargo and vehicles, but that only scratches the surface of what's available. The addition of heists, in particular, adds a cooperative element to the gameplay, allowing you to team up with friends or other players to pull off elaborate missions. The sheer variety of activities and the continuous support from the developers ensure that GTA V Online never feels stale or repetitive.  However, it's worth noting that the game's age does come with a few drawbacks. While the visuals were impressive in 2013, newer games have since surpassed them in terms of graphical fidelity. Additionally, some players have expressed concerns about the online component, specifically regarding balancing issues and the presence of microtransactions. Nevertheless, Rockstar Games continues to support the game and address player feedback, striving to maintain an enjoyable and fair experience for all.   WARNING Be aware of cheaters in GTA V Online. Some players may resort to cheating, using hacks or mods to gain unfair advantages or disrupt the gameplay experience. Cheaters can exhibit behaviors such as invincibility, unlimited resources, griefing, and money exploits. To minimize encounters with cheaters, it is recommended to play in private sessions with trusted friends or invite-only players. Rockstar Games actively combats cheaters and encourages reporting of suspected cheaters. Despite the presence of cheaters, don't let it discourage you from enjoying the vast and exciting world of GTA V Online with precautions in place.   FINAL SUMMARY :   If you're looking for an incredible gaming experience, I highly recommend giving GTA V a try. This game offers an outstanding adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end. With its expansive open world and countless activities, there's never a dull moment. The story mode alone is worth diving into, with its thrilling narrative and well-developed characters that will have you invested from start to finish. And don't worry, the story is long, ensuring you'll have plenty of gameplay to enjoy.  But the excitement doesn't stop there! GTA V Online is a whole new world of possibilities. You can run businesses, participate in exhilarating heists, and explore a constantly evolving online world. The amount of content available is mind-blowing, and there's always something new to discover. Trust me, you won't run out of things to do.  Prepare to be blown away by the stunning graphics. The attention to detail in the world of Los Santos is absolutely breathtaking, making the experience feel incredibly immersive. And let's not forget the fantastic soundtrack that sets the perfect tone for every moment.  Oh, and there's even more! With the Director Mode, you can unleash your creativity and become a virtual filmmaker, creating your own custom scenes and movies within the game. It's an incredible feature that adds an extra layer of fun and excitement.  In conclusion, if you're seeking an amazing gaming experience that offers endless possibilities and entertainment, GTA V is the game for you. It's a thrilling adventure that will keep you engaged for countless hours. So go ahead, jump into the action, and prepare for an unforgettable journey in the world of GTA V!"

great game play with mods at your own risk if you do play consistently or they will ban you 1st is for a moth 2nd is a perm and if you manage to play again it will be ip so your computer is flagged on the game

really good cool ragdolls and stuff like that
robvery
Nice game but updates is so lame
"GTA Online can be fun with friends, but this fun is completely overshadowed by the games countless issues. This game is filled with 5+ minute loading screens that constantly fail to load or give you error messages. This game is also riddled with hackers who will either kill you repeatedly, spam your screen with ads for their service, crash your game, or in some cases even leak your personal information live in the text chat. Yet after 10+ years, Rockstar refuses to do anything about these issues and leaves their players to deal with the games onslaught of problems."
I would rather have my rectum torn out of my body than be blown up from another child in a jet
i keep getting banned
The game lets me get out all of my anger
Can shoot people beri gud
"shooting people, thumbs up"
"Fun, I will never EVER get bored of this game, when you have nothing to do, do missions. If you finish all of the missions, redo them!"
rhh
This game cannot be player offline in Steam Deck. You always need to have an Internet connection in order to start the game.  Great game but not on Steam Deck and its portable nature.
the grind is insane in the membrane

good game for kids under 6

buggy with garbage updates (they removed like a third of the cars in the last update) and even worse servers. only consider getting this when its on sale because the foundation is amazing and its actually fun when it works.
this game will not let me play
unironically a better racing game than forza horizon 5
its valid
its gta wats not to like
Hacker issue
very good game to play for hours
dfd
fun game to play i love being hunted down every time i join a public server

"The missions aren't to bad except anything to do with Trevor. It wont stay on your upgraded car and puts you in your default car which you cant get rid of. Upgraded cars end up in impound even though you were driving them when you quit game. Online is full of issues,bugs and slow load times that usually end up with you having to quit. Online tutorial was a pain in the A** just to get it to load and work but it finally did. Cyber punk is a much better option if wanting a open world shooter. Its Actually sad since  Reddead 2 is amazing."

"great game 10 years ago, now there's too many crybaby modders who kick you for talking shit, killing players or not giving them your attention, GTA6 when?"
an action game
"After over 500 hours and years of playing on this account (have more hours on other platforms), I ran into a game-breaking issue. I have this in my Steam and Epic Games libraries, but the game seems to believe that I'm playing a pirated version because every time I launch GTA V, I get a request to activate my copy of the game. However, when I use my key from my steam copy, I get an error saying that I already own the game. No shit Rockstar. This error won't even allow me to play story mode, so the game is completely bricked. It's mind-boggling how this has been going on for years and there's no fix. I didn't get banned, never got an email from Rockstar, never had an issue. I played yesterday. I'm not buying another copy of this game."
Too many cheaters but cool
Goated game.
Removed 188 cars from online and put it behind a paywall that pc users cant even get. Plus they removed the faggios which are not lesser used vehicles.
i love this game help me get my 67 hours of my life back :(

"Hey everyone, I bought GTA V from Steam and it's been days now ever since the game is ""launched"" whenever I open up the Steam app, and it remains on ""Shutting off"" without ever being fully closed... So I can't play it at all... It's either stuck on ""launched"" or ""closing off""... Does anybody have any idea what I should be doing? Thanks !"
Although its a very good game    Don't buy it   wait for GTA6  :)

"I am a 59-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing Grand Theft Auto V. I am a single father to my son, who is now 5. My son recently started playing Grand Theft Auto V. In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing Grand Theft Auto V. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well."

This game is a masterpiece <3

Shit game (real)
trash story
Its fun been out forever
GUYS ITS GTA
"Highly recommend. It's a good all around game that allows its users to create their own personal experience in a world of corruption and greed. I play purely for building and running the multiple businesses that the game has to offer while collecting vehicles and properties. It can also be played as an all out war on everyone, but it is overall a very versatile game for its age and has held up very well over the years."
good.....

yhfgv
Can some1 play cayo perico heist with me im need gta money
um loved it
its really fun with friends
One of the best game ever!
very nice and mafia vibes game
"Ok game.  UPDATED REVIEW: After spending even more hours, I could say that it is a very good game. There are multiple types of businesses and honestly, you should just focus on having fun with these businesses. People nowadays are very stuck up with min-maxing everything to the point where they want to get the most amount of cash possible in the smallest amount of time and as someone who has been through that point, I could say that it makes the game quite boring at a certain point. Focus less on being efficient, try and find a business that you find fun, and do whatever you want and enjoy the game.  Some downsides that are apparent in this game are the number of cheaters that are able to freely roam around servers. There is also this glitch that I have been through ever since my first few hours of the game wherein when I open my in-game phone, and go to quick jobs, then join a heist alone, I am always stuck in this infinite loading screen loop. I have already searched it up on Reddit, some say that it is a problem with my internet, but some say it's a problem with Rockstar servers.   Playing with friends is also very easy and the overall user interface of the game is easy to deal with. It's also not a pay to win game, but it's a pay to get a head start type of game. I have played GTA 5 online across several of my accounts before and it is also disappointing how Rockstar decided to remove hundreds of cars from the game, I find it very unnecessary.  Now is a very good time to play GTA 5 because of how there are even more concurrent players than ever before, meaning that servers are very lively and you wont really feel brain dead in doing Rockstar's repetitive missions."

"The game is fun but if you have alot of money on your steam wallet or in your credit card then buy it, if you want to spend all of your steam wallet or your mother gave you some money then i dont recommend the game."
good because i can crush people in my ford f150
"In the earlier phase of playing the game I enjoyed the game, including Story Mode and Online, even right now I would say that story mode is great but the story is too short and the map and story feels too small compared to the story and side missions experienced in SanAndreas. One could just complete the whole story in less than 4 days. Now coming to the online mode the big reason I would not recommend people to go for it because of my recent experiences of the online mode, and I would also recommend people with limited budget to rather wait for GTA VI instead of buying this because as soon as GTA VI is released all the focus of Rock Star will move towards Vi which would lead to no to meager updates in GTA V. Concluding that getting to my present Online experience, right now the game is in more bad condition than it was an year ago, as I am experiencing more in game bugs, increase in hackers and multiple online sessions resulting failure, I would say that if I am playing 1 Hrs in a day in online mode then I'm actually only able to play only 40 Minutes maximum because minimum 20 minutes are being taken by bugs, hackers, session initialisation, mission start and exit initialisation, session faults. which in the end leads to more frustration rather than entertainment. My personal mission experience - I was stuck at the end point of Online mission when I was delivering the cargo to a location when my vehicle stopped moving once I reached the delivery marker when I was required to move the vehicle inside a garage but was unable to because of being stuck at the marker with vehicle not moving my character unable to get out of vehicle, then I killed myself and re did the mission and again same bug. recently when I purchased an apartment I was trying to the apartment i purchased in online mode the game got all blacked out and stopped sunning. I had to stop the game and start again. on a mission I was to hide my presence from others I hid in a place as I was being hunted by other players due to one mission in online when I was hiding in an underground parking I was suddenly teleported to another location and killed by some player who was already there aiming at me in waiting as if he knew I would appear there, then I thought it might have been a bug, but when I hid again that thing continued to happen for at least 10 times till the timer was over and the hacker and bug did my game so bad that even after the end of the mission I was unable to exit the mission I was stuck at the mission timer reaching 00:00 me being unable to exit until I switched to story mode and enter another session. This is one list of harassment going on in game these days so i won't recommend anyone buying this and rather wait for GTA VI another reason being too less online players so less that it is getting to hard to get even 4 players to sometimes host a mission. I would say GTA V is nearing its end."
dude this is the OG game why would'nt i recomend
good game. lot of hackers.
"nice game,good graphics..."
"great game, just if ur playing online, do it in a private session."
the only thing i would want to be added is cross platform

"Can't recommend any of this developers games. For the past couple YEARS, unable to get rockstar online services to work. Unable to play any of their games. Can't recommend games ya can't even play, let alone the developer."
Pew pew fun
"I will say, this is a classic game (almost too classic considering it came out in 2015 and we still dont have a sequel yet), but I have to not recommend it for two main reasons.  1) There is a severe lag issue when it comes to driving too fast. This is surprisingly one of the few games I have had to tinker with significantly to make it play well enough and that came with the issue of having to lower the graphics a lot. I don't believe it was my computer as this is a major issue that you can look up and see multiple people having on different hardware.  2) The online is filled with hackers and cheaters. Rockstar is unreliable when it comes to protecting their consumers so I would have to say if you don't know how to protect yourself well, then you shouldn't risk it because no one will be looking out for you.  If you only plan on playing the story and don't mind tinkering with your system to make it run well, then it is a good game. But if you plan on playing online or don't have the patience for fixing the game, then pass on this."
"Great game! I have been playing this game during 10 years, and I finally bought it on steam."

STRIP CLUBS
"This is a game where you are either a ""Grinder"" or a ""Kd nerd"", but rping is better than doing both."
easy to play and have fun when having looked at a tutorial on youtube
"Removing tons of content for ""Experience improvement"" (but they will bring it back as time exclusives to trigger fomo an grabbing more cash from you). Yes they removed content and telling you that this is good for you.  Gta+ - Just pay Rockstar even more money for overpriced shit. You want the removed cars again? Just pay again and now there is no problem with the ""experience"" anymore lol  Rockstar trying to get rid of singleplayer modding because how dare you dont buy there shitty, overpriced stuff and use free and better community mods   Pandering to woke mob and trying to be woke. Removing content because SJW are offended. Oh boy I cant wait to play as pregnant black non binary xer/xis saving the world against racist white males in GTA 6 if it ever will be released.   Also steam is helping them with cleansing reviews like this which mentioning the truth. Just like google is trying to reduce articels talking about their 200 cars remove patch."
shooting my friends is fun
cant get old online account

"Hackers just make the game unplayable. The only way to play ONLINE mode without hackers crashing your game, you have to play exclusively on invite only. Might as well just stay on the story mode."
storymode is fun
I hated this game. It was extremely fun and addictive.
CVBFDSG
Amazing Story line and Multiplayer game
"I like this game and all, but there was an update that I wish never came or they should have done some stuff differently, instead of removing more stuff then what they added in the Mercenaries Update, to be added to that this is known as the worlds worst update Rockstar has ever released to the public.   So I don't recommend Until they change the fact that they removed 150 vehicles from the GTA 5 online vehicle websites. And some of those vehicles that they removed are the ones that I was interested into buying. And now I can't because of you ROCKSTAR!  So ya I don't recommend to those new comers to this game until they change or add back some of the cars like the vehicles they added when they introduced the Auto shop to the game, LIKE WHY ROCKSTAR WHY!  #WorstUpdateEver  Ah, one last thing I hope that Rockstar adds a speedometer on the central hub when in vehicles, (And when a player is in Third-Person.)."
Just a great game! lol
cool i like the black guy he steal stuff
This game has been out for 10 years and they still haven't fixed the infinite black loading screen glitch when loading into a property or between missions. This goes without talking about all of the other bs from this past update.
Really good game with open world playing for all levels. Online trolls make it a pain and spoil the fun for others.
car game good
This game is realy fun so far even i dont have played much
"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is an absolute thrill ride of open-world mayhem and excitement. With its stunning graphics, immersive storytelling, and endless possibilities, it's a game that keeps you hooked from start to finish. Whether you're engaging in epic heists, exploring the vast city of Los Santos, or causing chaos with friends in the multiplayer mode, GTA V delivers an unparalleled experience. The attention to detail, diverse missions, and memorable characters make it a true gem in the gaming world."
"Xbox 360, PS4 and now I have it on Steam. Well."
go to the strip club and get a private dance
its GTA what to say a classic and even better with GTA V. Played in PlayStation and now on PC do not regret any entertaining hours spent.
This game thought me that 7 is a nice but not an expensive amount
"The buggiest garbage you will ever fucking play on pc. Your cars will just disappear for no fucking reason. Even your fucking 8 million dollar MK2. Rockstar is fucking disgraceful on this PC port, laziest fucking cash grab I have ever seen."
i love theiving grandly 5 times automatically
the best game i have ever played. best open world game
its being dumb and wont let me sing in
ITS A 99999999bsq/10

"if you want to join an online session, don't buy. If you want to join friends, don't buy. If you want to make money without spending $100 real money, don't buy. If you want to complete free roam missions, don't buy. If you want to play for more than 30 minutes without encountering a game breaking bug, don't buy. If you want to get griefed by hackers in every single lobby, buy."
vary gud game ricommend
Classic good old gta 5 cant go wrong for hours of fun with mods!
"Indescribable, classic. This is something everyone has to play at some point. It might not fit everyone but everyone can find some part to enjoy."
"Solo - lags and softlocks, online - unplayable"
Best roblox tycoon I've ever played
good game when you want gynormus stress go to strip club when your parents are at home
LOVE THIS GAME
There is a reason why this game is still relevant in 2023. Hopefully they can preserve the relevance into their next sequel and delivery it before the time is too late.

"heh, boobs"
Removed 200 cars and labelled it as 'cleaning up the game' on a 10 year old game that was doing fine before. Nowadays they just want people to buy shark cards to make money and price all of the things in game at ridiculous prices to make you feel like you need to buy shark cards to keep up. The rockstar game launcher is also shit and annoying. They could have just left it how it was before. Awful
over 9 years of Gta single good 2 weeks of online off to hang myself
"Game good is good, content is good. I recommend this game to try hards, car guys, people who needs to chill, and to people who seek the nostalgia of GTA. Good game!"

One of the best games out there parental warning though!

this game is bussin bussin+good graphics and realistic
i like 8 years old girls
Nice story

"Pretty fun game.  I play mostly online, and while the game itself is fun, il have to leave a negative review as the servers/session system rockstar has going on, is the worst system i have ever witnessed. You are just as likely to spend as much time sitting waiting to join a lobby, as you are playing the game, thx for wasting my time."
better then gta 4
my screen get black every time i do heist
Good memories and amazing game
when i mod in gta v offline mode it starts lagging so much that is downside of this.
"its extremely fun, it does cost quite a lot, but in my opinion. I believe its worth the money, Online is pretty fun aswell. i enjoy the singleplayer mode. Its not so bad and you can walk around without getting shot by an other player. hope you enjoy, enjoyed it as much as i do."

vdff
It's GTA V so it is good duh.
w game hacker  give me level 32
one of the finest multiplayer games to chill out with friends
"Do not buy it if you want to play the online mode! So...long story short: I brought this game for around 15 euros,just so I could play the online mode,then after 30 hrs of installing it I finally ended up in an online lobby,where I was killed multiple times then griefed by an modder and last but not least the game got crashed so baddly that my Pc crashed too... The fact that Rockstar charges money for this broken pile of garbage is like a bad joke in my opinion.  Oh and also; you can't just buy the standalone game,you are forced to buy some overpriced DLC with it for atleast 10 euros,yikes.  (The Offline mode meanwhile is fine,it is a solid 30-ish hrs of gameplay,but nothing more)"
just its good
It was fun
jok
Mr. beast said if i get 3000 points he will get me a lambo so pls help me

anjay
Great game to play with children
Nice game.But I request you to play it on pc not laptop. It lags only (on my laptop) playable at 800x600 . But really nice game. Will continue to play it on Ps.
best open world game and you can do job heist and much more more
Rockstar. stop updating the game and actually make it playable on PC without a million mod menu's in use every day that can grab peoples IP and dox them (grab all info about location and PC info) which is shocking for a big game company like Rockstar. do better. these modder's need to get a life and stop being little cunts sat on this game. absolutely shit game other than private lobbies and friends lobbies. do not get gta other than for private lobbies or friends only lobbies. Stay AWAY from public lobbies as much as possible.
"Rockstar just let someone steal my game. I try to sign in to social club, and rockstar tells me sign in with an email address I've never seen in my life. Rockstar support refuses to message back."

"Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it receives. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this open-world extravaganza, providing an immersive, captivating, and endlessly entertaining experience for players.  First and foremost, the graphics in GTA 5 are breathtaking. The attention to detail is astounding, from the realistic lighting and weather effects to the stunningly rendered environments. The game effortlessly transports you to the sprawling metropolis of Los Santos, creating a living, breathing world that feels alive and vibrant.  The gameplay mechanics in GTA 5 are exceptional, offering a seamless blend of action, driving, and exploration. The controls are intuitive and responsive, making it easy to navigate the vast cityscape and engage in thrilling missions. Whether you're embarking on high-speed chases, engaging in intense gunfights, or simply indulging in some leisurely activities, the gameplay is consistently engaging and satisfying.  One of the standout features of GTA 5 is its incredible storytelling. The game boasts a rich and complex narrative, following the lives of three protagonists: Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. Each character is unique and well-developed, and their intertwining stories provide a level of depth rarely seen in open-world games. The writing is sharp, the dialogue is witty, and the voice acting is top-notch, creating an immersive experience that keeps you invested from start to finish.  In addition to the main storyline, GTA 5 offers a staggering amount of content and activities to enjoy. From engaging in heists and missions to participating in various side quests and challenges, there's always something new and exciting to discover. The multiplayer component, GTA Online, further extends the game's longevity, allowing players to team up with friends or engage in thrilling competitive modes.  Furthermore, Rockstar Games has demonstrated exceptional post-launch support for GTA 5. Regular updates and content expansions have kept the game fresh and engaging, introducing new missions, vehicles, and gameplay modes. The dedication to the player community is commendable and ensures that the GTA 5 experience continues to evolve over time.  In conclusion, GTA 5 on Steam is an absolute triumph of game design. With its stunning visuals, captivating gameplay, compelling storytelling, and vast amount of content, it sets the bar high for open-world games. Whether you're a fan of action, adventure, or simply exploring a vibrant virtual world, GTA 5 delivers an unforgettable experience that will keep you coming back for more."

"Grand Theft Auto V its fine, now if you wanna play GTA V online you have to consider the huge amount of time you will waste on loading screens plus crashes of the game that will close it entirely and you will have to open it back which will cost you even more time, also every single session you will join will have at least 2-3 cheaters-modders who will kill you on spawn without being able to react but log out of the game entirely..."
Intro waiting...

This game is amazing. Playing in 2023 btw.
the best game that i played
"Played through this game several times (on Xbox), will play through it several more. There's a reason so many people play it. One of the greatest games of all time in my opinion. The world is so detailed and really makes you feel like a criminal in Los Angeles and California. The story has been criticized by some, but I feel most people will enjoy it unless you're a major book/film enthusiast who likes to deeply analyze stories and plots and is hard to please. I don't enjoy the online experience, but it has its moments every now and then. Overall a 8 or 9 out of 10 for me."
lkjhgi
Bring back the cars... or make a second hand site for them
I only play this game to distract myself from the fact that Im not snoop dog
Aaaa
easy easy chinken gigga
i havent finished the story buts its honestly really good and online is not amazing because of the hackers but its alright
Best RPG
"game never loads. you are constantly in a black loading screen, it doesnt matter if your doing a job or walking into your garage. it will never load"
game is good and have very good characters specially trevor
best game of mission i love this game
ive played 102 hours in 15 days i think that shows something about how good the game is
grat game
i wasted so much time on this garbage
The game is very nice for example the U.I is very simple and easy to use but the driving is kinda boring and me and my friends always fight over who needs to drive but all together its a good game and I 100% recommend.
i love gta i play it lots on my xbox but i can never load into online idk why it just makes me wait ages can anyone help?
for honestly i don't have any interest in GTA online nor in the story because the american crime story in GTA  become really old but the Mod what really interest me and what make me really want to play the game a lot.
good but too much cheaters
Oh ok
i ran over an innocent bystander with monster truck...... good game :)
its just the best game
Online keeps on loading 24/7 . If online took less than 1 minute to load  i would rate it 4/5 . now they have not fixed this issue since a decade so i would rate this 1/5 .
Best GTA Game yet
fun n stuff
LO Recomiendo mucho por la jugabilidad y por la libertad pero si tienes ganas de descargar mods es muy complicado. deberian hacer una workshop como los demas juegos
good game lot of featres
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

its good but i finished too early on story mode
stop firing rockets at my house - wise man
"After having my account hacked and a different Steam account attached to my Club Social, I tried to get it fixed, and found that if I DO get it fixed I will no longer be able to play GTA5 or GTA online...ya know...the products I payed for. Rockstar games is an embarrassment and a joke."
it crashes like every 10 mins its unplayable
ses
its a great game to play on five m
the game doesn't load properly it crashes every time on the loading screen
Online mode  to much mod & cheat player VERY BAD
one the my top5 so far and the realistic graphics make it insanly good
online players are the definition of FUCKING CANCER.
i like running people over with cars
"Bad game, Rockstar sucks, they can't fix a thing, but if the modders are not ddosing you, knocking on your door (they can find out where you live by seeing your ip address), corrupting your Social Club account, removing your money or getting you permanently banned, it's a pretty good game. Will keep playing it.  -Social life"
"I can do whatever I wanted to do irl, killing people, do other crimes and many more, this is a good stress relief."
goold
A good game
waste of my life
they banned me for nothing
i play too much... oh noes

best game to play if u tryna mod fr
vwer hg#
"latest update removes 180+ cars from the normal buypool and puts them in a rotating pool behind the gta+ paywall. Absolutely disgusting anti-consumer practices from R*, although that's to be expected at this point."
The bet game ever
"the storymode is superb, there's original quest, funny character and full of action. the online mode otherwise is just  long grindy game. You start by doing poorly paid mission, you unlock a heist, you do it multiple time, you buy more property/asset and you repeat the process. the cheaters are everywhere, spamming the chat to sell you fake money for real money (dont try to report them, they know who report them). If you wanna sell your stock in a public session pray god, because 1/2 chance that someone is gonna ruin your fun with is flying moto with missile."
its fun i enjoy shooting people.  Im not crazy i was tested when i was 7 and it came back negative
too many bugs crashes often
cool i guess
L ima be back to cheat just wait
fuck this game i played i so much im fatter then nickocado avocado im 553 pounds
fdfdgbgngdngc
YUH!!!
great game for gamers
idk what to write
very gut dake
"Game is great started playing it on my xbox one, then swithced to PC so now its even better then ever, better fps, roleplay servers. just overall amazing cant wait for gta 6 to finally come out though."
"A must play game for any gamer. The story of GTA 5 is fun, intriguing and quite silly. With many different mission and 3 different main characters, the game play never gets old or boring. Even after you finish the story, you have the entirety of Los Santos to explore and have fun in. This world is your oyster; collect cars, rob stores, commit all sorts of crimes. Get out there and cause some chaos."
great game....
"Transphobic jokes are were we draw the line. Removing offensive jokes, adding a trans prostitute. Yup that did it for me. uninstalling this garbage. Going to try to find a way to buy a physical copy of the 2013 version of the game."
ONE OF THE BEST GAME ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT AUTOMATICALLY CLOSES WHILE RUNNING
I love this game so much that I want to delete the game after I buy the yatch 10/10
car get theft auto'd very cool mhm yes
"Unplayable between the 50/50 chance of a player being a cheater and it being a random chance to be able to join a friend's lobby, very frustrating to be chased and gunned down by god mode players that crash your game if you go passive or run away. I don't recommend this game to anyone in it's current state, ten fold if you're trying to play with friends. GTA is the only game that I've played that I really really enjoy playing but I simply can't without something hindering the experience, I can't wait for GTA 6 to more than likely follow the same fate at launch, and it will because they never cared to fix it in GTA 5."
where is the pc version of this game ? it seems like the old 360 version the graphics for this are complete dog $hit even in max settings hell my ps4 pro version looks better than this one it's the same for the game control as well they are both $hitty poorly detailed xbox versions instead of pc why is that ? why can't we get the better pc versions on here ? I swear fallout 76 is the only good detailed game on here that is for pc and the new steam client sucks !
amazing at first but still pretty fun
"GTA 5 Online: where you can embrace the chaos and let loose your wild side, but unfortunately, some players take it a step too far. Picture this: you're cruising down the virtual streets of Los Santos, minding your own business, when suddenly you hear it—a player spewing slurs like a malfunctioning censor machine. It's like they attended the School of Profanity and graduated with honors. But fear not, because GTA 5 has a secret weapon: the mute button! With one swift click, you can silence those foul-mouthed troublemakers and get back to enjoying the game. Remember, folks, virtual mayhem is fun, but spreading love and laughter is where the real party's at!"
somewhat gud game
it is very wholesome. kid friendly for sure
boobies.
bring back the cars you removed and stop making shitty business decisions.
it is a fun game and i have been playing it since the xbox 360 and with them modded lobbys used to be fire and fun

great game with mods on
they are killing their own game
Full of modders! Don't waste ur money unless it is free!
"10/10, the game itself is very unique and amazing, I like the graphics and the overall content. This game is definitely a COP.  A tip for whoever starting out the game, don't rob stores  it's a waste of time and it doesn't give you alot of money. Do heists and quests with your friends and enjoy the game, goodluck!"
its very fun to play with friends

"All though this game has its ups and downs (especially on PC), it's still an amazing game, I only wish Rockstar would listen to their community a bit more and also allow PC to have the ability as next gen consoles."
Lots of fun. For whatever reason I stopped getting missions so I ended up uninstalling. Trying again today from scratch.

7/10  This is by all means a good game. Anyone writing negative reviews for it has either never played it or has a garbage internet connection and therefor cannot experience it.
"it's a good game, also i got the funny number of hours played hehe"
its an awesome game
"the best game EVER. literally you can do whatever you want, and yes that does include having an illegal gun selling business held in a bunker to a gun store"
"Ignore my low playtime, I have 1500 hours on PS4, though I quit about a year ago: From what I've been hearing lately, this game simply isn't worth it anymore, Online has been boring to me every since the contract DLC launched."
Online is just trash
"Don't buy this game for the online, almost all the races have at least one guy that has speedhacks or other mods installed. In my last game I got softlocked by one hacker with an exploit that I can find refrences to from 3 years ago. Rockstar doesn't care about the state of the game, all they care about is shoveling dlcs down our throat with more and more ways to get killed by someone without having any way of defending yourself. Even disregarding the horrendous load times online, the game has become a cesspool for shitty devs to ""reward"" long term players so they can curb stomp on anyone if they felt like it"
Very good and fun game with a lot of action adn good missions. The story is also very interesting.

Very fire game. Online makes  me angry tho

"A full price game that requires additional funds to unlock most in game content. Won't matter how hard you try, some bozo will fly up to you on a rocket-motorcycle and shoot missiles at you, the second you log in, and when you aim at him, your game crashes.  Unplayable"
a very fun adn exciting game
too much hackers
i mean it was only 16 dollars so not that bad download take a lilltle bit but all well worth the time and money
"Considering how the remote code exploit has still not been addressed publically, considering how the online game works on PC still running on peer to peer even though it is ""masked"" through proxies this game is still a cyber-security hazard for anyone playing it. This is on top of all the bad decisions on the part of Rockstar and Take Two, squeezing every last penny out of the playerbase as if this game was a free to play. But instead of it being free to play to this day it costs 80% of what i paid for it in 2016, 40 euros. It's not simply enough that someone purchases a game, no no we have to milk them for every penny after. I get it, it's just greed and opportunity. But I don't have to agree with it or think it is moral.  For anyone who sees this review and wishes to play singleplayer safely, look into a firewall plugin and block every one of GTA:Online gateways. (Yes, a modder can mess with your singleplayer game and potentially inject malicious code into it as well)  What a mess.."
Love getting pummeled by oppressors

This game and the creators make me want to play Valorant because I'd rather play a terrible game than one that makes you work like a black person in the 1700's.

its fabulos
New Update is okay just bring a casino as business that we can run and operate

"4.5/10 - They are only keeping up with this game to sell you sharkcards. They just released an update that removed a lot of cars from being purchasable unless you pay for their SUBSCRIPTION.   The game sort of holds a monopoly on this type of game the ""online open world crime GTA-esque"" so they can afford to be incredibly lazy unless it's an endeavor to increase the chances that you buy those sharkcards. This guise of being a ""sandbox"" game while having many more MMO elements to the game is quite disingenuous.   By the way... they still haven't fixed the hackers. Every lobby on free-play has AT LEAST 1 hacker, many have half a dozen. What's almost worse is that the problems that hackers bring to this game were ALREADY present in the game - Griefing. Greifing is so bad in this game that it can be downright unplayable is most public lobbies that they fairly recently HAD to make it so you could run your organizations and businesses in a private session to get away from them.   This game is an insidious waste of energy and money. You're only somewhat better off buying this on console"

Definitely one of the games of all time.
"Although I am about 10 years late to the party, I am happy to have purchased the game now.  But the story mode so far has been great, the characters are cool and it's dope.  Very fun to play, and what else can I say?  It will live on as a classic."
not on this app i downloaded a mod that could make the game fight better when i launched the game it waited in to the game loaded in 14 seconds too kick me off and i deleted the mod out of every single thing and i even deleted the game added it back and it do the same like a bitch now bye.

"Rating: ★★★★★  Review:  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is an absolute masterpiece that has set the bar high for open-world gaming. Developed by Rockstar Games, this fifth installment in the iconic Grand Theft Auto series offers an unparalleled experience that seamlessly blends a gripping storyline, immersive gameplay, and a vast, living world.  One of the standout features of GTA V is its captivating narrative. The game follows the lives of three protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking redemption; Franklin, a street-smart hustler looking for a way out of the gang life; and Trevor, a volatile and unpredictable character with a penchant for chaos. The intertwining stories of these characters create a rich and engaging plot that keeps players hooked from start to finish.  The attention to detail in GTA V is truly remarkable. The sprawling city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas are meticulously crafted, offering a stunningly realistic and dynamic environment. From the bustling streets filled with pedestrians and traffic to the diverse landscapes that range from urban areas to the picturesque countryside, every corner of this world feels alive and vibrant.  The gameplay mechanics in GTA V are polished and refined, providing a seamless and enjoyable experience. Whether you're engaging in high-speed car chases, participating in adrenaline-pumping heists, or simply exploring the vast open world, the controls are intuitive and responsive. The game also offers a wide range of activities and side missions, ensuring that there's always something new and exciting to discover.  One of the most impressive aspects of GTA V is its online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online. This mode allows players to explore the world of Los Santos with friends, engage in cooperative missions, or compete against each other in various game modes. The constant updates and additions to the online mode have kept the community engaged and the experience fresh, making it a significant value addition to an already outstanding game.  Visually, GTA V is a stunning achievement. The graphics are breathtaking, with detailed character models, realistic lighting, and impressive environmental effects. The attention to detail extends to the sound design as well, with a stellar soundtrack and voice acting that brings the characters to life.  However, it's worth noting that GTA V does contain mature content and themes, which may not be suitable for all players. The game's portrayal of violence, crime, and adult situations is integral to its narrative, but it's important to exercise discretion when considering its suitability for younger audiences.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a true masterpiece that excels in every aspect. Its gripping storyline, immersive gameplay, stunning visuals, and expansive open world make it a must-play for any fan of the genre. Rockstar Games has once again raised the bar for open-world gaming, and GTA V stands as a testament to their unparalleled craftsmanship."

You'll spend half of your playtime messing around
Yea having fun
"Dude, do NOT enter the shoe store and do NOT ask a lady there to dance with you"
"They just removed nearly Two Hundred (200) cars from being able to be normally bought in the game,  and of course, put in place new systems/subscriptions to necessitate real money to access them,  systems and subscriptions that AREN'T even accessible to those of us on PC!!  Rockstar has tarnished the experience of GTA on PC and 'last gen' consoles to the point that you might as well not play it, and even on new-gen consoles they are clearly showing everyone the finger to anyone who isn't going to drop their wallet on their game."
I love this game from since it came out but the modders do me dirty
it made me reset all of my progress. (New Review) Slightly better because of nice modders that give you money and xp. (wouldn't have to do this if i could transfer my account) But the Jews over at Rockstar don't want that.
graphic is a little bad
Its just very good
funnn
"Really fun game but violence, there is"
CAN'T HAVE HAVE SEX WITH TREVOR
maybe a lil good
kacke alla. Müsst ihr wisssen
Play the story before hopping into online and don't join public sessions unless you want to be griefed by a modder or some guy with an overpowered flying bike.
why is gta VI not out yet its been over 891264398127381273891739821 7years
big black men
hackrs kill me and i have no guns. these motherfuckers have helicopters
its fun to do hiests
prob like the one of the best games ever made
Imagine taking away content thats been in your game for years and putting it behind a paywall/removing it. DISGUSTING.
nigga dick
big boom and death and stripers
online with friends so fun
"When the Lobbies are not full of ding dongs and ho ho's, or maybe just a quiet crew session This game is very enjoyable..  Nothing better than running around blowing stuff up and knocking off the baddies or becoming one Muahhahaha!"
cant play with console players sadly
Nice game. Toxic Community
"Overall the game is good, but why am i getting a black screen so many times when i complete cayo preps or doomsday heist preps? I hope that rockstar will fix this issue"
bullshit
Its fun especially with friends
"This game is terrible. Like everything these days, you must sign up for a social club. put it down for a few months? it will not sign into my account for the life of me, i cant remember the email. Fine, i thought, i make another account. nooooope, it wont accept anything else but that account from my steam account.  rock star support wont help and has said, im shit out of luck unless i buy another copy with a different steam account. regardless of spending 60$ on this game. Not worth it."
don't piss of Michael ;)

A game where your rules matter.
"it good, do drug"
"the game is fun but it is so damn anoying that the social club is ""inactive"""
in the 4 days that ive had this game i can honestly say that it meets expectations. but its been out forever. we all know what its like
this game is very buggy. 5 stars
It is  just good.
funyyyyy
Rockstar continues to make decisions backed by greed and has not listened to the fans for years now. If I could return the game I would.

do it with friends story is 10/10
money money money
Gta 5 is very good games
"The story mode is the real treasure of this game. Little to no complaints with that. I adored the characters, the plot, atmosphere, all that etc etc. My real gripe is the online mode. It runs like total ASS. Like, I've played mobile games that somehow not only run better, but they also don't have their entire game being run by 12 year olds with $20 mod menus. It's absolutely pathetic. How much is this company worth again? This game has not produced anything generally good since 2013 when it initially launched, despite being updated constantly. We don't care about your shitty mission DLCs that are all locked behind a paywall that would impress Trump himself. Fix the game. Put the cars back. Get rid of all these stupid little Timmy's running rampant with mommy's credit card buying mod menus. The LEAST you could do for this community is anti-cheat. Jesus."
modders suck
How can they fck it up and remove almost 200 vehicles?  also story mode is decent
Ive play for 70+ Hours and haven't began to get bored
Absolutely perfect open world game...
its great game
outside
Boring gameplay. Bad gunplay paired with worse vehicle handling.
this game is fun without mods if u complete the game without mods trust me its worth it

"Its good. I didn't like this game at first and it was sort of not that fun. But playing a couple of more hours in and its actually great. Characters are good, my favorite being Franklin. And the missions are fun and are a great ways for going into another. But I did have a problem with guns. The recoil is not even there, and the sounds are alright but it just felt weird to use a shotgun with barley any recoil or an lmg. At least snipers have them but that's it. Some missions would put you in a helicopter and its really hard piloting one of them. Other than that its a great game."
it's okay I guess
"good game, wish they added some features from gta san andreas tho such as eating and working out but overall its a good game"
haven't played it once
This game has taken my life from me.
"This shit is broke. ive installed it on two good working computers and the rockstar launcher crashes on both of them every single time. Thought it might have been a corrupt file or something went wrong on install but I still havnt been able to see the loading screen for the actual game yet and it says i have 7 hours of play time ffs.  Update, A game bought off steam should simply install and run. It says I have over 100 hours of play time but its because GTA5 wont close and it constantly says its running to steam. Just installed again after months and the launcher freezes instantly and still unplayable. Cant stop it from running in steam. Think a refund would be nice since they obv cant fix their dog shit launcher problems."
Meh.

"its really fun, whenever i got the game my starter pack was just not there, i waited a day and i got it."
nvm
pew pew pew. police chases pog.
love it bro
Ive owned GTA5 on many different platforms over the years and you can't not get GTA 5 because it's such a classic and great game. Though online might be a different story In general GTA 5 Is a great game and I would recommend for lots of players.
You can finally create a solo session!!

"I have been playing the Grand Theft Auto series since the original. If I remember correctly that was released in October 1997. As for GTA V/Online I have bought multiple  copies(PS3, PS4, and PC). A girlfriend and her kid enjoyed playing so much we had 3x PS3s and 3x TVs so we could all play together at the same time. I have spent too much money on Shark Cards but got lots of cool vehicles with it. This game is not perfect. The developers are all about making money. Will GTA VI ever come out? Will it be any good? That will happen if and when it happens. In the meantime I definitely recommend GTA V/Online."
good open world game. nice story
SOOOOO FUN
good game quite fun good made
"If you love open world games, you'll definitely like and have fun with this one. The downside are the modders on public session."

very cool lolo buy game unless ur a child or smth :P
everything about thuis game is amazing
Single Player is good but I'm leaving a negative review for ruining online and delisting the classics and replacing it with inferior versions. GTA 6 will probably be trash as well but I won't bother trying it anyway

The only reason to play this game is for story mode mods. Fuck GTA Online
Very fun to play with friends and heart racing when doing heists. hackers are getting out of hand but just ignore them just go to another session if they are bothering you. story is alright.

"How greedy does R* have to be to remove half the cars from being purchasable and put some of them behind a paywall with GTA+? The missions from the new update are absolutely horrendous and it feels super dry when half the cars are gone  It's also absolutely ridiculous how the new xbox and the ps5 has access to GTA+ and all the cars they removed, but pc doesn't? Absolutely ridiculous...  I don't doubt they'll even further disappoint it's playerbase with another god awful update"

"I robbed someones car, than i got out of the car and beat them with a bat, a knife, a hammer, and my fists, as soon as that i proceed to get an ak-47 and load two magazines on the innocent person. Then i decided to get her car and run over her, AND THEN i robbed other people cars and got all of them close to the body now already destroyed, and so a took a grenade and threw it against it all and exploded everything. That person probaly had a family, dreams, filosfies to follow and religion, and i just randomly got there and ruined and disrespected it all, while some people say that is sadicist to do, i just think it is a little funny...  10/10"

In the newest update they took away over 186 vehicles including motorcycles etc.  They took all of that away and made it a subscription based rewards for GTA+ on the PS5 version of the game. This is disgusting corporate greed.

"Imagine, if you will. A game about cars.  The game has hundreds of cars, with new cars every update.  Some base game cars/early DLC cars get left in the dust, and ultimately they clutter up in-game websites.  Now, what would you do if you had to clean up the in-game websites?  Would you:  A. Create a new website for the base game/early DLC cars?  B. Add all of the early cars to the spawn pool so they can spawn in the world, and remove them from the websites? Allowing players to pluck them off the streets if they want them?  C. Remove almost 200 base game/early DLC vehicles from the websites, and basically make some cares IMPOSSIBLE to get on PC?  Guess what options Rockstar went with. (It was C.)  This is a blatant cash-grab move from Rockstar to add these cars behind a paywall later on.   This, along with YEARS of not updating the in-game economy makes GTA Online as grindy as modern MMORPG games.   Plus, if this is how GTA Online turns out, that means GTA Online 2 (or whatever it will be with GTA 6) will be just as bad.  I can't see myself playing GTA 6, not even the story mode. I don't want to support scummy business practices."
its literal the same game it aint got no worst but it aint got no better either
"Waaayy too many hackers in this game...... Good game but can be hard to have fun when hackers are literally quitting your game, like completely will turn off your game and you will have to load the game again from the launcher. Hackers have many commands at their disposal to even control your game and what happens to all players, not to mention they have the power to do almost anything they want with no consequences. Rockstar do not care, nor will they do anything about it. However it is a fun game and is very enjoyable at times. I do recommend it but get it on sale with the biggest shark card, you'll need as much money as possible as everything is way overpriced.  Also I will add, the servers for online are terrible!  Always disconnecting and the load times are pathetic!"
Hacker go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
vey good game works very good on ow end pc too
"Everybody know that GTA V is the greatest game,Until GTA 6 coming."

fuck trevor and i mean it
Just a really good and well made game. I recommend this game to everyone.
grait
good enough
ooooooooooo
it cured my autism
"before starting my performance of my PC Nvidia 3060 I7  I got the game for 15 dollars and I haven't regretted it. The graphics are breathtaking and can be enjoyed in 240+ fps. There were no stutters for me. The open world is fantastic and online with friends it's fun. Doing missions with strangers is rather less fun the Story is a must, I can only recommend it. Overall, I recommend the game"
big boi ballls
i hate getting killed by randoms in online randomly :c
good game with multiple friends
play online-watch out for cheaters dont accept any money or rp and dont ask for any
te5ry
shees
"Fantastic game play, funny stories. Really does keep you coming back for more"

brhgert
"very good, pew pew I get to kill many people"
Its fun but alot of bugs
"the new Online update removed ober 180 vehicles from being purchased which is an awful decision. Most of these will never be available again to PC players while console need to pay for GTA+ to purchase them now. Ridiculous concept, awful decisions."
"It's blatantly obvious that Rockstar isn't listening to their fanbase, nor do they like them. They've taken away vehicles and locked them behind a subscription, they've added new content locked behind millions of dollars only to earn about 200k in reward to doing these poorly made stories, and they've failed to give anything to progress the game aside from a few cameos of the main characters. This game needs to be revised by its dev team and redone to make everything actually acceptable to play for both veterans and new players alike. There's a reason why money and rp hacking is such a huge problem in this game and they need to update their progression and finance system to actually gain more traction than what they've gained the past few years."
"Good game, too many cheaters"
OFC BUY THIS GAME NOW!

Extremely fun with mods.
"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is a game that exists in a league of its own. Having logged in an impressive 369 hours on the game, I can confidently say that Rockstar Games has once again outdone themselves in creating a world that is not just vast and beautiful, but also vibrant, chaotic, and full of life. It's a testament to the meticulous attention to detail and the phenomenal execution of design concepts that permeates every aspect of this game. I unequivocally recommend this game to anyone seeking an immersive, thrilling, and grandeur-filled gaming experience.  From the outset, the narrative of Grand Theft Auto V is compelling, weaving together the storylines of three distinct protagonists: Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. Each character is uniquely flawed and equipped with a depth and complexity that keeps you invested in their journeys. The narrative jumps between these characters, serving up a rich tapestry of criminal undertakings that's both humorous and harrowing, reflecting the diverse realities of the fictional city of Los Santos and the surrounding Blaine County.  The mission design in GTA V deserves a heap of praise. Each task is meticulously detailed and varied, never letting the player settle into complacency. From high-stakes heists to casual errands that inevitably spiral out of control, every mission contributes to the broader narrative and character development in a meaningful way. The heist missions, in particular, are an innovative element that allow you to take part in planning, preparing, and executing elaborate criminal ventures.  The open-world aspect of the game is arguably one of the most detailed and immersive ever created. Los Santos and its surrounding areas are strikingly vast and offer a multitude of activities. You can indulge in street races, go hunting in the wilderness, play golf, trade in the stock market, or just explore the bustling city and its outskirts. Every corner of the game is meticulously crafted with a level of realism that's breath-taking. The game's dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add to the immersive experience, making the game world feel alive and constantly changing.  GTA V's gameplay mechanics are superb, providing a satisfying mix of driving and combat. The driving mechanics feel responsive and varied across the wide range of vehicles available, each with their unique handling characteristics. The combat system, too, is robust with a cover system that is intuitive, and a wide range of weapons each with distinctive pros and cons. Moreover, the introduction of the special abilities for each protagonist adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay mechanics.  Online multiplayer, introduced via Grand Theft Auto Online, provides a wholly different experience that further expands the game's shelf-life. Here, you can team up or compete with players around the globe in a variety of missions, races, and deathmatches, or simply roam the world freely causing mayhem. The continuous content updates from Rockstar keep this mode fresh and engaging, ensuring there's always something new to explore or achieve.  Graphically, the game remains impressive even years after its initial release, with stunning visual effects and detailed character models. The in-game sound, too, is excellent with a high-quality voice acting that breathes life into the characters and an extensive, genre-spanning soundtrack that complements the game's atmosphere brilliantly.  The game isn't without its flaws, though. The police AI can sometimes feel frustratingly relentless, and the load times, especially for GTA Online, can be lengthy. However, these issues are minor when compared to the wealth of content and meticulously crafted gaming experience that GTA V offers.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece of interactive storytelling, combining a compelling narrative, stunning graphics, a wide array of gameplay mechanics, and a detailed, dynamic world that feels genuine and vast. Moreover, the game's willingness to tackle themes of crime, morality, and the American Dream through its narrative and characters shows a depth of storytelling that goes beyond what one might expect from an open-world action-adventure game.  Rockstar’s trademark satirical social commentary is peppered throughout the game, adding a layer of intelligence and wit to the narrative. From the in-game TV shows and websites to the various NPCs you encounter, GTA V's keen critique of contemporary society makes the game feel grounded and real, despite its more outrageous elements.  Another noteworthy aspect of Grand Theft Auto V is its wide array of side activities. The game is filled with additional missions, hobbies, and pastimes that are optional but add further depth and immersion to the game. These can range from investing in real estate or the stock market, to participating in triathlons, stunt jumps, or even hunting for collectibles. These side activities not only help flesh out the world but also serve as a diversion from the main storyline, offering opportunities to delve deeper into the game's mechanics and universe.  Furthermore, Rockstar's dedication to updating and refining Grand Theft Auto Online has also added significant value to the game, long after its initial release. New heists, missions, and vehicles keep the multiplayer mode fresh and exciting, encouraging players to keep returning to the world of Los Santos and Blaine County. Plus, the addition of user-created content in the form of jobs and races contributes to an ever-expanding universe for players to explore and enjoy.  However, no game is perfect, and Grand Theft Auto V is no exception. While the AI has significantly improved from previous iterations, it can still behave erratically at times, occasionally pulling you out of the immersion. In addition, some players might find the game's depiction of violence and use of explicit language offensive, although these elements are indeed consistent with the game's mature and gritty narrative.  In summary, Grand Theft Auto V is an unparalleled achievement in the realm of video games. Its compelling narrative, coupled with a vast, vibrant world, intuitive gameplay, and an ever-evolving online component, make it a game that stands the test of time. Despite minor shortcomings, GTA V offers a gaming experience that is both thrilling and deeply engaging, making it a must-play for any serious gamer. It's a captivating journey into the dark underbelly of the American dream, offering a compelling exploration of its characters' complex personalities and motivations. I cannot recommend it enough."
"It's a fun and relaxing game, let's go!."

funniest momment of all time was when the hacker trapped us in a cage and made us fight
"Too many mf modders... Can't make it to the casino without getting my brain blown up and car totaled... It's mid ig, but hopeful for the new one that's supposedly coming out soon"

THIS GAME IS SO GOOD
"It's GTA V man, I don't know what else to say"
red colors
"Bought it 1 year after it released on PC, right when the Online component first released. So yeah lots of years ago. I could not recover that account for the life of me, it was 15 bucks on hear so, fine ill buy it again. Fun stuff. Worth the 15 bucks, hate the monetization. Single player is the breadwinner hear. Online is the cherry on top. Just don't spend money on  it. Don't need to"
Online kinda sucks now but story mode is still fun
This is so cool i got a lap dance from cheetah
Because Grand Theft Auto is great
Game fun. I only play online mode though :)
it is a cool game :)
This game lags too much i cant even enjoy it without its lagging on story mode. There needs to be a option where you do not want to  do story mode and just play with others but its a must to do the modes.
"This game here is one of the best out there.. I just love to do missions and intract with others and drive with them for no reason in online, But the thing is hackers are making your life hard. After my work i used to take off my steam in this game. But these hackers are making the game unplayable. Killing you for no reasons. Blocking your game for no reason, Making you get attacked by trevor  and military for no reason, crashing the game, trapping you in a cage. so overall all the sessions are taken over by the hackers only. If an hacker is present in the session your game will get stuck when you enter a building, or after you finish a mission it keeps loading. so i play around 2 hours max and 1.5 hours i have to wait for the game to load or go to a session with less hackers/ a hacker who minds his own business, Worst part is Rockstar only need money they are not at all doing anything to prevent them. I decided to move on from GTA 5 forever."
"You forget 1000 things every day, make sure this is one of them."
its a good game for children it is very educational in worth ethics 😁😁
THE most poorly designed multiplayer experience I've ever had the displeasure of paying for ever. (Story mode is alright <3) Don't bother buying this game or the extra content for GTA Online
NICECED
Glitchy as shit and ran by hackers
GTA IS ALWAYS TOP 3
"Shit game, nice mods tho, i also download numerous hacks and it improves the experience, thank you kiddions mod menu, ps fix cayo retards"

"pls do not buy this game, the latest dlc removed 186 cars from the already fucking frustrating game, GTA online used to be so good but now rockstar does the exact opposite of what players want, these motherfuckers are more money hungry than EA at this point. F**k urself rockstar"
Sehr gut

its a fun gane
"pretty fun, missions are good, guns and explosives are nice to use, but why does the shoe store have naked women in it?"
"A publisher that REMOVES nearly two hundred vehicles ""to streamline the shopping experience"" ten years after release to put them behind a paywall that PC users can't access is the epitome of thumbing their nose at their users. I came back to the game after a long hiatus and find (found) collecting the cars to customize to be the most enjoyable thing about returning. Maybe I like driving the cars that no one else does. Maybe I'll never ""buy"" them. Maybe I would have ""bought"" them all. Either way, if they were available to us once, then they should continue to be so. Would you accept a car company entering your garage to remove the turbocharger that you bought with your car? Or worse, that company telling you that if you want to have the turbocharger that you'll now have to pay a premium? It's slimy."
This game good :)

girl melon cool
"In the flour attic, crackling cookie jars danced in the laundry napkin, while crocodile soup jazzily hops on the cloud carpet. Space pirates cleaved dark sourdoughs while stardust laughed in symphonic discord. The snake god clipped feather-light with the screwdriver, while the grapevines fenced in sniffling elephant herds. Dewdrops discussed quantum physics with intertwined kittens and discovered that the harmony of time lay in a lost sock at a cosmic party. Summer rain waltzed with the indecisive thoughts of the hourglass, while the rusty trumpet sang love songs to anxious rainbow flies. The windmill spun dreamily among the lost breaths of a blue whale, and the misplaced key to the essence of everything was found under a talking mushroom."
i just like the game
"Very Fun and Enjoyable game. But Public lobbies are chaos, most people playing invite only sessions only these days. The only problem of this game are glitches"

"I'm sorry but I can't turn on gta 5, I've tried everything to fix it"
"R* won't take action against modders. . .  PvP is impossible because everyone uses godmode or mod menu.  PC doesn't get content updates that new gen consoles get.  Bugs and Glitches force you to find a new lobby every half hour or so. . .  I've uploaded videos of modders being abusive, and have reported them, only to see them again in a week doing the same thing. . .  Boycott Rockstar. . .  GTA6 is around the corner, and Rockstar only cares about the money. . .  They don't give a Four letter word, about their game. . .  If they did they would implement a working anti cheat, they would fix the bugs that have been around for 5+ years, and they would show their PC players some love by giving them the same content that consoles get.  DO NOT BUY! ! !  BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR! ! !"

"GTA 5 is an exceptional game that offers a vast open world and immersive gameplay. The story is captivating, filled with memorable characters and thrilling missions. The attention to detail in the graphics and sound design is impressive. However, the online component can be plagued by connectivity issues and microtransactions, impacting the overall experience."

"This game destroys lives and breaks families. Like Robby just be beating his meat to strippers all day! He calls real women ugly and mid, but those pixel whores do it for this sick son of a bitch. It has consumed him he does not even talk to the kids anymore. He just sits their in his own filth wasting away to get fake money. The house smells like pizza and shit. His eyes are blood shot, his skin pale as the moon, and he can not even talk like a normal person. All he can say is ""GTA"" ""W"" or Rizzler. Please help he does not have many more days it might be too late......."
