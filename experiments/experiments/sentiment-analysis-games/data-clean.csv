"Well, what can I say about GTA V, if not GTA V Online, which is the one I've played the most and will mention. Well, it's riddled with issues in various ways, to the point where the game is flooded with hackers everywhere. You really feel absolutely nothing when conquering a yacht or a mansion; the game is so saturated with hackers that everyone has everything, and public sessions are complete chaos. And seriously, it's no joke how many hackers there are. The other day, they put me inside a container, and I had to leave the session because I couldn't escape; the hacker kept forcing me into that container. So, reconsider spending your money on this game if you're only going to play online; it's really not worth it. Now, the story mode, on the other hand, is worth it. It doesn't have the limitations of online and even features animals and a whole living universe, unlike online. So, that's it; grab it on sale, have fun, and please, don't use hack in this game."
this is awesome game
this is the best game but when i did cayo perico heist the money was not added to my account
CARS
...
Yes nice
only good thing about this game are the mods. rockstars gta online is not good. only good if  you get fivem and/or mods.
erf
i love to throw 99999 degree honeybuns at the homeless people on gta 5 i cannot wait to see the quality on gta 6 when i go 120 mph through a group of hitch hikers
"Fun, I will never EVER get bored of this game, when you have nothing to do, do missions. If you finish all of the missions, redo them!"
cd o gta 6 pra pc?

LOADING TIMES IS THE WORST CUZ OUTDATED BUT THEY WILL STILL POST UPDATES TO THIS GAME REGARDLESSLY AND ABANDON RDO ]
"Haven't played the campaign yet, but online is super fun totally worth the money"
