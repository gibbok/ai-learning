"Don't bother to enjoy Online gameplay in public lobbies. Modders will do every annoying thing to mess with random people. They will change your car modifications, apartment and any other property interior and other details that you've spend in-game money and essentially time on. Rockstars tolerance towards cheating is unmatched. So, there are 3 options: be a cheater yourself, only play with a friend group in invite-only sessions or download a FiveM. In my experience, worst than Battlefield V cheating-wise.",False

"Grand Theft Auto V isn't just a game, it's a cultural phenomenon, a testament to the boundless creativity of the human spirit.

And let's not forget the characters - they're like something out of a blockbuster movie, each with their own story and personality. Oh, and did I mention the online mode? It's like stepping into a virtual playground with your friends, causing mayhem together or competing in wild challenges. Seriously, if you haven't played GTA V yet, what are you waiting for?

The game forces you to need other players to run your empire. Other p[layers are toxic a-holes. Not really much fun. Also the missions are super lazy. They just spawn endless npcs and toss them at you. No real thought went into the missions. Game is like a 5/10. Gets boring fast.,False

Everyone knows about GTA V so if youre looking at reviews to buy... where have you been? Obviously this game is great with a good story mode with three different characters. Only this i wish was different was me getting account reset a few years ago because i bit the bullet on a money glitch. It was all my fault and i lost the account i had since the 360 days. I barely play anymore because of that. YEARS of progress lol so dont do glitches and youll be good,True

"Title: ""GTA 5: The Great Account Heist - An Epic Fail-o-rama!""  Review:  ⭐️☆☆☆☆  ""Welcome to the thrilling world of GTA 5, where the only heist happening is Rockstar stealing access to the game you paid for! Strap in, folks, because this is a rollercoaster ride of frustration and disbelief.  So, there I was, ready to dive into the criminal underworld with my trusty mouse and keyboard, only to discover that my access pass was kidnapped by the nefarious Rockstar account. It's like buying a ticket to the movies, but the usher locks the theater door, and the popcorn machine is guarded by a grumpy troll demanding a secret handshake that I've long forgotten.  Attempting to rescue my game from the clutches of the elusive Rockstar account was like trying to outsmart a criminal mastermind, only this time the criminal mastermind is a forgotten email address. I sent messages to customer support, and their response time made the speed of a snail on a leisurely Sunday stroll seem like a bullet train.  GTA 5 now sits in my Steam library like an untouchable gangster surrounded by a digital forcefield. I can almost hear it taunting me, ""You can look, but you can't touch, sucker!""  Rockstar, you've turned my virtual crime spree into a tragic comedy of errors. It's not Grand Theft Auto; it's Grand Theft My Sanity. I half expect to see my character in-game, standing on a virtual street corner with a sign that reads, 'Will work for access to my own game.'  In conclusion, fellow gamers, if you enjoy a good caper, make sure it's within the game itself and not a digital battle to reclaim access to what you've rightfully purchased. As for Rockstar, I hope they find their moral compass – it's probably hidden in a forgotten password vault guarded by virtual dragons.""  Message @Mutis ﻿      to select",False

"To show how much I love this game - I played for around 350~ hours before I even bothered to play through the story. It is such an incredibly fun game, and I didn't expect how captivating the story would be. I just finished the entire story for the first time and am immediately restarting the game to play through it again.  I cannot recommend this game enough. Online mode is a little wacky, but still fun. And singleplayer was absolutely incredible. I don't remember a time when a game made me feel just this hard for its characters.  Absolutely one of my favourite games of all time. I thought people were overhyping it, but it's honestly not hyped up enough.",True

"It is unfortunate that an advanced cheat provider who purchased the complete source code of Grand Theft Auto V from a leaker would develop cheats that far exceed the anti-cheats of the GTAV developers. They can crash on the computers of players they don't like, they can corrupt data, and they can even corrupt cloud-saved data if they can hack into the cloud. The only version of this game that has been popular and successful is the console version. In the PC version, there is always at least one modder in every session. GTAV has events, and depending on the cheats used by the modder, they can irreversibly corrupt an entire session and potentially have a negative impact on performance. A good friend of ours has unraveled why only PCs experience casino robberies and other heists and unusual events within a session. The modder is unknowingly inhibiting script events and network events necessary for activity in the session with the functionality of the protection section in the mod menu he is using. Did you see empty roads with NPC cars completely gone in your session? Did you enter a robbery or mission and get stuck in an endless loading loop and eventually get kicked out of the mission with a network error? Crashes despite being on a very high end computer? Did you become unable to walk, lose your weapon, or switch weapons when in the same session with a particular player? No, all of these are not coincidental. Behind those major errors and supposed bugs, ignorant modders are interfering with the scripting and networking events necessary to keep the session active and maintained. The session is not well controlled and can be destroyed. Rockstar Games removed 95% of its anti-cheat content around late 2023 because the source code for the Rockstar anti-cheat was leaked. The remaining 5% of the anti-cheat is probably the part that Rockstar really cares about, protecting Rockstar's profits and game logic, which validates the amount of money given in money drops and missions. I for one am not holding my breath for GTA6.  Because Rockstar Games was looking for technicians who are familiar with networking related issues when they were looking for technicians. I am sure GTA VI will also use P2P connections. Rockstar Games is a garbage company that only cares about money, not players' opinions! Get the hell out of business??",False

When i was 32 i discovered masturbating, and it was surprisingly nice. when i was 34 i married a beatuíful girl from Miami. When i was 35 she cheated on me and i divorced her. when i was 36 i met a new girl whom was perferct in every single way. Last year when i was 37, the new love of my life killed my whole family.

"The single player for this is about what you'd expect for GTA. The mechanics are pretty tight.  The online part of the game is where they put the burnt of their effort for the past ten years, and that's really good.  However, Rockstar really do things by half measures. As it stands, the PS5/Xbox One X version of the game has loads of content they just never ported to PC, the online content never made it to the single player, making it a vastly inferior experience, and even small quality of life things, like setting defaults for the weapon wheel, have never been implemented in the online mode.  You'd think that with the crunch culture and worker exploitation they practice, they'd have the time :|  As it stands, I'd say, if you want to play the Online mode, play on PS5.",False

Rockstars social club is a joke.  I can now no longer play any Rockstar games because my  Rcokstar social club account was apparently hacked and taken over.  Now when I try to launch any of those games I am told the account is assigned to another social club account and I cannot play it.  I spent a lot of time dealing with Rockstar support and provided screen shot after screen shot proving ownership of my steam account and the original social club account.  I also included proof of purchase of both  games.  After proving ownership repeatedly I was told I did not prove ownersip and essentially to take a hike and have a nice day.  The ticket was then immediately closed and I was not even allowed a follow up.  WIll never support anything Rockstar ever again.  I own the games and they are on my steam account and still cannot play them because of Rockstar.  I spent hours online doing research to resolve it myself and its clear this is a widespread problem that Rockstar doesn't care about.,False

It's more about the retarded shit Rockstar added over time, that turned that mode into a true fuckfest, and it all started with the Oppressor.  But as if jerks flying around on rocket puking jet bikes, aimlessly blowing everything and everyone to pieces wasn't bad enough, Rockstar also doesn't seem to care much about the abundance of small dick cheaters, who make your gaming experience in public sessions even more miserable.

"A Timeless Classic: Grand Theft Auto V  My journey with the Grand Theft Auto franchise began in 2016 when I was first introduced to GTA 5 at my friend's house. Watching him skillfully evade the police, diving into storm drains, ignited my fascination with the game. Back then, I owned an Xbox 360 E, a Christmas gift from 2014. Surprisingly, GTA 5 wasn't my first encounter with the series; that honor belonged to GTA San Andreas on the PS2, emulated through PCSX2. I vividly recall cruising around, soaking in the open-world experience. Later, I delved into GTA 4, experimenting with mods and further immersing myself in the franchise. Despite not fully engaging with the story mode, I was undeniably hooked. After watching all the cutscenes of GTA 5, I knew I had to play it. On December 21st, 2016, at the age of 13, I finally acquired a copy for my Xbox 360, albeit under the alias Franklin Clinton, as my mum wasn't keen on me playing a PEGI 18 game. Unfortunately, a damaged disc led me to purchase the digital version, marking the start of my story mode journey, which took me nine months to complete. In 2018, I received an Xbox One for Christmas, reigniting my passion for GTA 5. Transitioning to the newer console was bittersweet, especially with the closure of Xbox 360 servers, where I had amassed considerable wealth. However, the lure of enhanced graphics and gameplay on the Xbox One was undeniable. The year 2020 brought an unexpected gift when GTA 5 became available for free on the Epic Games Store. With my recent GPU upgrade to an Nvidia GTX 1650 Super, I seized the opportunity, knowing the game would run smoothly on my system. Fast forward to the present, and I've conquered the story mode on Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. Now, with the game on Series S, the thrill continues. Watching YouTuber VideoKames navigate through her first playthrough of the game was a delight, especially knowing that even Ned Luke, the voice actor for Michael, was tuning in. Grand Theft Auto V holds a special place in my heart, its missions never failing to evoke a smile or laughter. As I eagerly await Rockstar Games' next masterpiece, GTA 6, I know my love for this game will endure. Framing my GTA V map and hanging it on my wall will serve as a testament to the countless memories and joy it has brought me.   P.S. The PC version lacks the love and support seen in the current generation consoles. Despite having the ability for mods, I'm not a fan of how GTA Roleplay has overtaken what made this game special. Nevertheless, Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece, and Rockstar Games should be proud of their accomplishment.",True

"Rub salt all over the chicken. Let it stay for 15 minutes. Heat the oil in a cooking pot. Prepare the batter. Start by pressing a fork on the chicken cube until it is completely squashed. Combine it with warm milk. Stir until well blended. Set aside. Combine flour, baking powder, garlic powder, salt, and ground black pepper. Mix well using a fork or a wire whisk. Set aside. Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl. Add the milk mixture. Continue to beat until all the ingredients are all incorporated. Add half of flour mixture. Whisk. Add the remaining half and whisk until the texture of the batter becomes smooth. Dredge the chicken in flour and then dip in batter. Roll it again in flour until completely covered.

"This game used to be great fun, I loved playing it and had lots of amazing experiences with my friend. Until they changed it about 2 months ago. They fucked up big time. Our main source of income - the Cayo Perico heist - had its setup cost quadripuled, lots of ui and menu changes made the ui and menus really confusing and idk what happened, but the graphics changed somehow - I used to have the deafult settings and had pretty smooth gameplay, no major lag spikes, but today I turned GTA on, I didn't change my settings and it lagged like pure hell about half the time. Also, it looked awful, which it didn't before, like I had texture quality at its lowest and reflections at the highest, even though I had them both at Very High. And maybe worst of all - they banned my friend for basically no reason. He and I were playing on a private server and he used some mod to just SPAWN VEHICHLES, not give or take money, not get access to a new property, just spawn vehichles, which we destroyed afterwards, and 3 days later, Rockstar emails him, saying he has been banned for 30 days AND had his character WIPED. Keep in mind, he had never cheated before and didn't even do it on a public server and didn't change his stats in any way. AND, he had hundreds of hours of playtime, where he legitly got a facility, nightclub, Kosatka, multiple milions and a lot of other things, including a shit ton of cars. He lost all of it. For spawning a few cars, planes and a tank. In short, Rocktar Games are a leech that wants to suck as much money from you as possible and then wipe it, so you have to buy it again.",False

"Even though I don't play it as often these days, this game holds such a special place in my heart. It's not just about the missions or the cars; it's about the moments spent with friends, hustling together to afford those dream rides. There's something about cruising in first-person mode, especially when it's raining outside or as the sun sets, with the radio playing in the background—it feels like I'm right there in the moment.  I've never really explored private servers; I've heard they can be iffy, and using accelerators for foreign ones isn't my thing either. So, I stick to the official servers. I got into this game back in high school, and now, here I am in my sophomore year of college. While I used to get tired of it quickly, as life has gotten busier, this game has become my sanctuary, a place to escape to when things get overwhelming.  It's more than just a game to me; it's a timeless escape. I'm eagerly awaiting GTA 6, and I have faith that Rockstar will keep pushing the boundaries and giving us even more ways to immerse ourselves in their worlds. That's the beauty of gaming—creating these unforgettable adventures.",True

"look... the game is fun. Incredibly fun! The story is great, and if you don't know how the game ends by now, either you play with cheats only, or you've been living under a rock. or both. The only complaint i have is for online and the people who play it. Some people are there to have a good time, they'll race around the city, talk, and generally they're good fun. That's the kind of person you friend on social club and do jobs with. Then there's the other crowd. Modders, griefers, and trolls. These people intend to make life hell for any online player regardless of who it is. There are some cases where you meet modders who will give you money and RP to allow you to have more fun in GTA's online without wasting your own money, but these people are few and far between. If you run into any of the group (save for a good modder) your best bet is to block the player on social club and find a new lobby. If you do meet a modder who will give you money, you would be advised to friend them to hopefully gain as much money as possible.",True

great game bad modders,True
very good game but also very bad game at the same time,True
"This game is full of damn modders, Every time i have tried GTA online i have always either been greeted by someone who does not have a life or i am just given a bunch of money EVEN WHEN I DON'T WANT IT. And worse yet after about 30 days of not playing i log on and see i have to reactivate my account. easy right? NO, NOT EASY because apparently rock-star likes to send you irredeemable codes that i have to put in the rock-star games thing and WORSE YET EVERY NAME IS TAKEN. ALL OF EM. u wont find a single decent one and WORSE YET rock-star is a pain in the ass in general because when i have to close my game on extremely short notice the game likes to verify: ""AR YOU sure YOu waNT to QuIT BRO"" like YEA NO SHIT ASS HOLE THAT'S WHY I PRESSED ALT F FOUR DUMB-ASS Bitch. spread the word about this USELESS ass game and GTA 6 will be shit too i fucking hate you rock-star you ignorant pieces of shit!!!!!  EXTRA NOTES: also cheaters frequently like to disable your internet from time to time so get that refund as SOON as you can guys this game SUCKS. Not worth the fifteen pound at ALL. i wouldnt get it if i was held at gunpoint.",False

there are modders but some are friendly and some kick you off the game if you get those type i wouldnt recommend the game to them and there are different types of players the grinders the kind players and griefer players,True
Why do I have to play dress up everytime I start a mission as Michael? The fact I have to google what specific outfits I have to wear for what specific mission single handedly ruins the game for me. I also just finished playing 1 set of the tennis minigame with Amanda that took 45 fucking minuets and was the hardest thing Ive ever had to do in any video game ive ever played. GTA 6 better be good because replaying this game in 2024 made me realize how awful it is.,False

Yes, the money online is a grind, but when you just wanna do something chill and easy, it's not too bad to do now and then.   Do need a pretty substantial PC spec to run it at max, but most PC's would probably be fine these days. Really big fan of this iconic game, can't wait for GTA IV.",True

"Online gameplay is just too much of a security vulnerability.  Overall I'd spent less than an hour online and got teleported to the ocean, promptly killed, then something or another happened to corrupt my online account.  A game with security vulnerabilities of this nature (which based on reddit discussions have been unpatched for more than a year) shouldn't be available for sale let alone installed.  Hard pass.

"My go-to game when I've had enough of the real world and want to escape reality for some time. Expands well upon that one mechanic every other GTA title missed - immersion. Drive around the posh Vinewood streets looking for exotic sports cars or explore the Grand Senora Desert and expect random encounters with muggers or hitchhikers, or take a U-turn and climb Mt. Chiliad, to feel on top of the world. The game comes with endless hours of game play even after completing all the missions, and the first-person mode coupled with your own tracks makes even aimless driving feel fun. The only downside is the wanted level system, which activates even when you stealthily kill a random NPC in the middle of the desert in the dead of the night. Nevertheless, the game is efficiently optimized on all its ports, which allows it to run even on low-end machines. The game play physics is spectacular, but in no way you must expect it to be near real-life since GTA V's not supposed to be a simulation game. In the end, this game will make you forget all your real-life problems for a while, as you step into the shoes of either Franklin, Michael or Trevor and feel the Los Santos sensation.",True

"You are better off playing this on console if you want to play in regular lobbies that aren't hacked or modded.  I played the crap out of this on Xbox and was excited for the steam experience when I built my PC but man, little did I know of the pain & misery that was waiting when I got into an online open lobby.   I've only ever modded Minecraft & Terraria and that has been a limited experience as I don't get the same value or fulfillment as others do, after so many hours I become bored, it's not the real experience & it's just not my thing to hack or mod.   Every regular lobby will have one or more people running hacks or some mod so they can't die or blow up. I just got on after months because of the same situation. I try to mess around in a normal lobby only to run into someone that is invincible. It never fails!!! Then of course I go to another lobby only for the same thing to happen again leading to me eventually getting off the game after just being on for under 1 HOUR!!!   The main hours I've put in on steam are for doing heists or something that doesn't involve others, which has completely taken away from making friends. joining crews & just in general trying to play the game normal like how I did on console, I'm at the point where I am truly questioning why I even try to play this on PC.  Rockstar really failed with the Steam version of this Online game-play. I truly hope GTA VI will be an improvement but I highly doubt it, so I'm not holding my breath and plan to return to Xbox for the next game so I can avoid the pathetic trolls & no lives of the ""PC World""",False

"The american dream, viewed through the lens of 3 wildly different characters who share similar occupations. Even these years later, its signature satire still holds up today.

Unless you shell out extra for a 3rd-party mod menu and pray you don't get banned, you are going to get crushed by everyone who does do that - and just generally feel terrible the whole time.",True

Been playing GTAV since launch on the Xbox 360 and have done over 20 playthroughs   Story 7.5/10 felt jumpy just jumping from new bad guy to new bad guy Franklin could've had more missions with the CGF and shit more backstory instead of just Micheal and Trevor fighting about something 9 years old but good overall  Characters 9/10 Some very iconic and memorable character in all of gaming  World 8/10 Most of it is mountains but apart from that its very atmospheric and immersive  Overall 8/10 solid GTA Game cant wait to see what Rockstar cooks up with GTA 6,True

"This game is wonderful, and tons of fun with friends. The quintessential crime simulator, and it's just as good as anyone else will say it is. I will definitely continue playing it with friends for quite a long time and encourage you to also give it a try. That being said, I've encountered a few big issues which I think really hurt it.  1. It's intended for multiplayer. Not necessarily a bad thing until you see that for some missions or businesses, you have to use multiple separate vehicles. It turns what could just be a simple longer mission into an enormous headache over traveling, backtracking, and doing the same trip 3 times.   2. The controls are inconsistent and were imagined by a thrice-lobotomized maniac. Sometimes, it's E. Other times, it's enter. Sometimes they make you use backspace, but then the escape key is needed. I was forced to agonize over delivering one package until I learned that that key they were prompting me was not enter nor backspace, but suddenly the RIGHT ARROW KEY.  3. SecuroServ bodyguards pay 100% OF MONEY THEY WOULD HAVE EARNED TO THEIR VIP (Non-mission/business one-off income was observed, but I haven't tested further). There is no toggle. This is not disclosed. I am now indebted to my friend because we wanted to to jobs in a group together.",False

Released in 2013, the game continues to captivate players with its unparalleled combination of gripping storytelling, immersive gameplay, and a meticulously crafted virtual world that oozes with detail.  The narrative unfolds through the eyes of three distinct protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor – each with their own unique personalities, backgrounds, and motivations. This innovative storytelling approach allows players to experience the narrative from multiple perspectives, creating a rich and dynamic storyline that keeps you engaged from start to finish. The character development is outstanding, making you emotionally invested in the fate of these antiheroes.  The game's open-world environment, the sprawling city of Los Santos, is nothing short of breathtaking. The level of detail is staggering, from the bustling urban streets to the serene beauty of the surrounding countryside. Whether you're exploring the city skyline, cruising through the Vinewood Hills, or engaging in high-speed chases across the desert, the world feels alive and dynamic, with every corner offering a new surprise.  GTA 5 boasts a diverse range of activities to keep players entertained for hours on end. From adrenaline-pumping heists to intense shootouts, leisurely rounds of golf to off-road races, the variety of missions and side activities is astonishing. The attention to detail extends to the radio stations, showcasing a wide array of genres and entertaining talk shows that enhance the immersive experience.  The multiplayer component, Grand Theft Auto Online, takes the experience to a whole new level. Joining forces with friends to complete heists, engaging in thrilling PvP battles, or simply cruising around the city in a customized vehicle adds an extra layer of excitement and longevity to the game. The constant updates and expansions introduced by Rockstar ensure that the online world stays fresh and engaging.  Visually, GTA 5 is a technical marvel. The graphics are stunning, showcasing the power of modern gaming hardware.

"An entertaining game that's doesn't take itself too seriously while still being mostly grounded in a reality where crime runs rampant. The places the game really shines are in it's heists the characters plan. Namely casing a score, then acquiring the things required for the job, and then finally executing the heist itself. The game even gives you a couple options for each heist. The other big entertainment factor with the game is in the parodies of various things in the world, like the talk show and news radio commentary on things that are happening in the game. It makes the game world feel a bit more lived in and I can definitely see why GTA Online has cultivated a strong RP community from these things.",True

"Grand Theft Auto Online, the multiplayer counterpart to GTA V, offers an expansive and dynamic online world. With a plethora of activities, heists, and customization options, it extends the game's longevity. However, occasional technical issues and balancing concerns aside, GTA Online remains a vibrant and engaging multiplayer experience in the iconic GTA universe. Since i have played this game for 300+ hours in just 2 months of buying the game i can confidently say the game is very nice and fun to play. Yes there are modders and cheaters but most of the businesses can be done in an invite only session and this provides a great security from griefers. DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN 2024 AFTER THE RELEASE OF GTA 6 TRAILER!!?? YES BECAUSE THIS GAME IS NOT DEAD YET AND WILL BE THERE FOR ATLEAST 2-3 YEARS COMING UP.",True

"Rockstar is notoriously shit at security. If you haven't played GTA in a while, your account has almost 100% been compromised by hackers. So what do you do? The only thing you can do is message Rockstar support. That shouldn't be an issue, but every time you reply to a ticket, you're talking to someone new. That means repeating yourself a dozen times, sending the same screenshots a dozen times. I have been talking to them for 5 days. I have sent them proof of purchase, proof I own the email account the Rockstar account was linked to, proof I've purchased Shark Cards. I've sent them screenshots of my Steam profile, screenshots of my Rockstar profile, screenshots of my friend requests... but the next day it's some new person talking to me, and they request the same exact information. It's crazy to me how they so easily allow someone into your account, but getting back into your own account is impossible. In my eyes, the issue is that they require you to use their bullshit, buttcheeks launcher, which has no benefit and only creates gaps in security. They said ""how about, instead of using Steams relatively safe and protected services, we make them sign up for our own shitty hacker-friendly launcher and then when their account inevitably gets hacked, maybe they'll just buy the game again.""  Buying a Rockstar game is just begging to have your information stolen by some man in China. Their support is so bad, I can't help but feel like its on purpose just to get you to make another account and re-buy the game.",False

"I have had lots of fun hours playing this game online but unfortunately I am unable to recommend due to one big flaw on PC.  This game is plagued my modders online. These are the groups that modify the game play using software to cheat and ruin others play time. Public lobbies on GTA Online can't be played effectively on PC. This is a known problem and a controversial issue as many like to mod and do so without interfering with others. Unfortunately my experience has been often toxic individuals who are bored and have fun ruining others game play by cheating. There is a big difference between getting upset that people are killing you on an online game that is PvP against modders that use god mode and remotely blow you up so you have no chance.   So why so many fun hours playing? Simple, me and my friends go into a crew restricted online lobby. This is the only effective way to play this game. Unfortunately by doing this you can't meet people in the online public lobbies to join your crew or expand your friends.   I do have concerns for GTA 6 as if it has the same problems I am likely not to bother. It's a shame as the game has so much good potential and can be really fun but I would probably say get it on console where the modifications are restricted.",False

You can play the market, make some dough, maybe even swim in millions or billions. But here's the thing, you end up drowning in cash like a lottery winner with nowhere to blow it. Singleplayer mode, though fantastic, feels a bit deserted after the story wraps up. Rockstar's updates forget about it like it's yesterday's news. Now, let's talk about the multiplayer, or as I like to call it, the school of life for young bloods. It's like a lesson in manners, respect, and sharing, but in a chaotic, online playground. If you want to enjoy it with mates, lock it down to a private session, unless you fancy a level +1000 twerp going all mafia boss on you.  And get this – you can buy a yacht in the game. Real boss move, huh? The top-tier one sets you back a cool $10,000,000. But here's the twist again – the most in-game money you can buy is $8,000,000, and that's gonna cost you a hundred real bucks. Talk about highway robbery in a game that's already bleeding your wallet dry.  I could go on and on about a game and a company that seem to have a PhD in squeezing every penny out of the fans, shutting down companies they once praised. But let's get straight to it. Singleplayer? Absolutely top-notch. Multiplayer? Stay away like it's the plague. GTA Online is like a case study proving that achieving world peace is easier than navigating that online circus. Cheers to the campaign, but keep your distance from the multiplayer madness.",True

"Singleplayer (story mode) is amazing with a lot of content. The story is fun to play and the amount of details in the game map is incredible!  Multiplayer (online) is a big letdown. The community is full of players looking to start fights for no reason, griefing is promoted, and excessive mods on PC break all game barriers. Vehicles are too expensive and money-making methods are mostly ineffective, except for the Cayo Perico heist. I play GTA Online alone more than with anyone else.

"TL;DR: This is the most buggy game I've played in years, possibly ever.  It seems like every other mission requires alt+f4 and a reload to work. The very first mission bugged back to back and I almost didn't bother racing Lamar and requested a refund. I've had the game crash 3 times, so like 1 crash per hour, basically. I picked the ""Cool Cat"" clothes and the cat graphic on the shirt constantly disappears, etc.   For system specs, I have a AMD Ryzen 7 5800X, 3080 TI, Samsung Evo, etc, so it shouldn't be related to hardware as I don't even run the game with maxed out settings.   Biotching aside, I haven't played a GTA since GTA3 on PS2(?) and despite all the BS buggy issues, I found it fun enough to keep booting the game back up. I have a thumbs down because with the game's popularity, time since release, and resources available at Rockstar, I don't think the stability issues are acceptable.  Honestly, I haven't experienced a game this buggy in recent memory, not Cyberpunk at launch, not New World at launch, not <INSERT BAD LAUNCH>, not any EA indie game, nothing; it's actually pretty absurd.",False

"[h1][b]Reality called - I hung up.[/b][/h1]  GTA V is like the Swiss Army knife of the gaming world – it has everything, and I mean literally EVERYTHING, that we could have only dreamed of in GTA: San Andreas: [list]     [*]Extensive Car Customization     [*]Playing as Multiple Characters     [*]Underwater Exploration     [*]Stock Market Trading     [*]Real Estate and Business Management     [*]Leisure Activities     [*]First-Person Mode     [*]Detailed Heist Planning and Execution     [*]Control a Dog     [*]Movie Theater Visits     [*]Hunting     [*]Interactive Internet     [*]Bounty Hunting [/list] and many other things that are not on the list  Basically, you can spend countless hours just customizing your ride and driving around, either obeying traffic laws or, more realistically, seeing how many you can break before the in-game law enforcement starts taking notes  [b]Just don't forget to pause and feed your actual cat[/b]",True

"I mainly purchased this game for the Online mode, however a month ago I have decided to relieve the memories of 10 year old me who played the story mode on the good ol' PlayStation 3 back in 2013.  Running triathlons, participating in different kind of races, calling friends for hangouts, participating in different random events, discovering some weird, but hilarious strangers and freaks (props to Nigel and Mrs. Thornill, funniest characters in GTA 5 I've ever witnessed), exploding myself while trying to do the knife flights challenges, checking LifeInvader of each playable character to really get into the story, hunting for deers, laughing my ass off while I brought all 3 playable characters together, made them play golf and watched as AI was absolutely awful at this game.  Story mode in GTA 5 is such a GOAT and I really wish that those DLCs that were planned wayyy back could see the light.   If you are purchasing the game for story mode, absolutely, go for it. If you are purchasing it for online only, eh. There are more fun online games with way better servers, which don't make you spend half of the time in loading screens, out there, buddy.",True

"This game has been the source of many of my most fond gaming memories. The base game comes with a rich story line based in a Los Angeles look-a-like city called Los Santos. In single player mode, you get three very interesting playable protagonists, each complementing the others in their own way. You have Michael, a ""retired"" father figure who is upset at the universe for his own doings. Franklin, the young gangster who is ready to chase some paper, but still has some lessons to learn about the world of organised crime. Lastly, there is Trevor. Trevor is a maniacal, meth-addled criminal who lives in bum-f*ck nowhere north of Los Santos. The three characters all have their own side missions and personal quests that will grow their strengths and sometimes even show their weaknesses. 10/10 Single player. After finishing the single player I jumped into GTA: Online. Since they do regular updates and content additions for free, the GTA Online community is still strong with a large player base. Mod menus do seem to be a dime a dozen, so you do need to be ready at any time to spontaneously combust. If they are too annoying, you can play single player or do a Crew session to keep them out. If you enjoy grinding missions to buy a fancy car or apartment, building an underground criminal empire, or shooting pedestrians, I would give this game a shot.",True

"Caros desenvolvedores do GTA V, Gostaria de expressar minha profunda gratidão pelo impacto positivo que o jogo teve em minha vida. Como pai solteiro de uma criança especial, enfrento diariamente desafios únicos. Foi surpreendente perceber como GTA V se tornou uma ferramenta valiosa para fortalecer nosso vínculo. A imersão no mundo do jogo nos proporcionou momentos de descontração e lazer, algo que muitas vezes é difícil de encontrar em nossa rotina. A variedade de atividades no jogo permitiu que eu e meu filho explorássemos juntos, criando memórias preciosas e fortalecendo nossa conexão. Além disso, a narrativa envolvente e os desafios estratégicos do jogo estimularam habilidades cognitivas e de resolução de problemas em meu filho, proporcionando uma experiência educativa de forma divertida. GTA V, para nós, transcendeu o rótulo de apenas um jogo. Tornou-se um meio para enfrentarmos desafios juntos, crescermos como família e encontrarmos alegria em momentos compartilhados. Agradeço sinceramente por criar algo que vai além do entretenimento e se transforma em uma ponte para conexões mais profundas e significativas.",True

"I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.",True

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is a groundbreaking open-world action-adventure game that continues to captivate players worldwide. Released in 2013, it remains a benchmark in the gaming industry for its expansive and detailed virtual recreation of Los Santos, a fictionalized version of Los Angeles.  One of the standout features of GTA V is its compelling narrative, told through the perspectives of three diverse protagonists: Michael, a retired criminal; Franklin, a street-smart hustler; and Trevor, a volatile and unpredictable character. The intertwining stories create a rich and immersive experience, complemented by exceptional voice acting and character development.  The game's vast open-world environment is a playground for mayhem and exploration. The attention to detail in the cityscape, from towering skyscrapers to gritty alleyways, is truly remarkable. The sheer variety of activities, missions, and side quests ensures that players always have something engaging to do, whether it's high-stakes heists, adrenaline-pumping car chases, or more leisurely pursuits like golf and tennis.  GTA V excels in its ability to seamlessly blend action, humor, and social commentary. The satirical take on modern society, celebrity culture, and the pursuit of the American Dream adds depth to the narrative. The radio stations and in-game media provide a humorous and insightful look at the world, making the game not just entertaining but also thought-provoking.  The game's multiplayer component, Grand Theft Auto Online, extends the experience beyond the single-player campaign. With its constantly evolving content, including heists, races, and a variety of customizable options, GTA Online has maintained a dedicated player base, fostering a dynamic online community.  However, it's worth noting that the game has faced criticism for its mature content, including violence and explicit language. This may not be suitable for all audiences, and potential players should be aware of the game's content before diving in.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains a monumental achievement in the gaming industry. Its combination of a compelling story, stunning open-world design, and diverse gameplay options make it a must-play for fans of the genre. While the mature content may not be suitable for everyone, those who appreciate a gripping narrative and a vast, immersive virtual world will find GTA V to be an unforgettable gaming experience.",True

Moreover, GTA Online extends this experience, facilitating multicultural interactions akin to those encountered in diverse societies.

I think it is, if you want to play this game for online mode I will just tell you it's ok because online mode is just earning money not more than that and when I say earning money like from doing heists,missions and from nightclub one of the best things to earn money from. When you earn money enough to buy your dream car you won't focus on another thing like you will just think this game is over. Only if you wan't to play for fun with your friends then this is something else. If you want that game for story mode then gg. I didn't try to play story mode but I think online is much better like the story is meh, that's  my opinion.

GTA Online is fine at the beginning but recently the new content getting boring and more bored. I know its not a DLC but the content really too short and no sense. Sometimes come with bunch of bug.. BTW still a lot of cheater bomb you here and there....,True
"GTA 5 Online is probably the most scummiest fucking thing ever, ignore my high playtime because that was before i realized that this game was made to take your money and nothing else. Almost every single person i came across had a mod menu and Rockstar isn't doing anything about it. Normally video games are meant to be a way to have fun and chill out, except this game is nothing but a chore. Grinding is so fucking boring and i know that it's supposed to be like that since you're doing the same missions over and over again but my god are some of the missions just fucking bullshit, like why can't i carry 3 crates at once? Why do the enemies have perfect aim? Why do some enemies not die from a headshot but some of them do? Why did some missions get nerfed? And why the FUCK is there a cooldown after every single fucking thing i do? Whether it be missions,phone or the interaction menu there is always a cooldown. The answers to these questions is one thing and one thing only, money (Shark Cards) Rockstar is doing everything in their power to make you spend money on this game and not giving a shit about any other game (RDR 2 because they haven't made a game since 2018 and no the shitty mobile port doesn't count) Rockstar is probably one of if not the most scummiest video game company i have ever seen.",False

"I want to love this game, i really do.  Dont get me wrong, its a great game, high quality story line.

Find some friendly players, and play in invite only matches, unless you want to spawn into a warzone where a lot of the time the enemy you face is literally invincible because there is no anticheat.  I would give this a thumbs up, if not, for the sheer volume of glitches and braindead, skill less players that use mk2's, the new stealth vtol, and straight up fucking mods and hacks.",False

"Played only on single player. This game hits the spot if you want to race around a city and be an outlaw. The story is not that interesting to me and the characters are underwhelming, although you may find them crudely entertaining at times. You will unfortunately be stuck very often listening to unlikable characters go on and on when you just want to try to outrun cops, jump motorcycles off of cliffs, fly planes or fight gangsters. The gameplay in the missions is very fun, though. You may want to get a controller that has little joysticks on it, like a generic xbox-style controller because you'll want to precisely control your speed and angle of movement, but you can get by with using a keyboard and mouse. You will have to deal with the Rockstar launcher but it is doable.  Overall it's a fun game and I recommend it.",True

Not a great start but there is a simple fix for that one. Then attempted a MC contract mission... drove to site, killed everyone, destroyed enemy choppers, stole some ugly looking flying motorcycle, delivered it to some clown who wants it but found that no matter which button I pressed the Spongebob cargo chopper would not release the cargo.

i love how alot of the online heists are unplayable not because of the overwhelming amount of hackers and modders flooding the lobbies but the actual game breaking bugs that they just refuse to fix for some fucking reason whats funny is that the only reason there isnt as big of a modding problem on console isnt because rockstar cares more about it on there its just that consoles are hard to jailbreak jesus i hope 6 isnt this bad if they do make a new online,False

"Grand Theft Auto V is like a virtual vacation where I get to indulge my inner criminal mastermind without any real-life consequences (thankfully!).

Пятую часть я долго не мног пройти так как особого желания небуло но что то мнея повело на то чтобы пройти сюжетку и увидеть какова история 3-ох главных героев. Игра по достежениям может быть не возможной так как в GTA Online мировые рекорды побили читеры от 3 - 10 секунд в гонках и других мисиях. Отчасти себя скажу... пройти сюжетку стоит хотябы 5 милионов доллоров в онлайне. Как то сравнить её с другим частями Grand Theft Auto не могу так как они довольно сильно отлечются.,True
"I have no problems with this game's story mode, in fact it was a great experience and I really liked the missions that this game offers. However, this is not the case for this game's online mode, Rockstar should improve their anti-cheat system because it is really ineffective. Everytime I log in and play GTA online, I either got killed immediately by some hackers or I got teleported everytime to a random place by them. The online mode in this game has reached the point where it is unplayable when it comes to public sessions. Please rockstar, improve your anti-cheat system because if this continues, then many people will lose interest in this game and you (rockstar) could lose a lot of profit (I mean this game had been published since 2013 so  I don't think that you guys care).",False

"This was a great game for its time. The physics, vehicles, story, and gameplay make for a very fun game, but my god does this game have some serious issues with its online mode. Majority of heists and gameplay used towards getting money are convoluted and boring. The pricing for vehicles are stupidly inconsistent, and imo some should just not be in the game to begin with. Every lobby is ridden with modders or hackers either blowing you to smithereens every time you respawn or exceedingly raising your rank and giving random amounts of money.    My hope for GTA 6's online is that it centers more into the roleplaying aspect of the game. Make the world feel grounded, have different kinds of roles and ways of making decent money. Have illegal roles like hitman, gangster,drug dealer, bankrobber. mobster, but also have like more honest money making roles like hunting, businessman, or mechanic, etc, to make the world feel more opportunistic.

"The best way that I can describe the GTA 5 experience is simply freedom. The game simply has no boundaries. You want 1v1 people go for it, car meets, heist, drug operations, flying, stealth, story mode, chaos; it does not matter. This game has dominated for over a decade now and there is a reason for that. The story is excellent, the online while it can be annoying at times is very well done. There are games that I would consider masterpieces; like God of War and Elden Ring, while GTA 5 may not be a masterpiece in the same sense as those two mentioned it is simply timeless. 10/10 would recommend.",True

"Main-Story was great and definitely fun to play through, the gameplay mechanics of GTA haven't aged at all and are still refreshing if you boot it up after a couple of months/years, they'll probably still be fun in the next ages, just the multiple 'main' characters were something I had to get used to at first but didn't mind after the first couple of hours of gameplay. (9.2/10)  The multiplayer has a bunch of flaws though, which just have gotten worse over time. I haven't played in years but I remember loading into an online lobby usually took, when you were lucky 10-15 minutes without any errors but the constant money farming and the unbalanced vehicles is basically what killed the fun for me, it's like either pay for microtransactions or farm for multiple tens or hundreds of hours some GTA dollars to buy some (mostly) useless addon to your base, vehicle etc, for the majority just to have it easier to kill other online players, which is for the most part completly irrelevant. The heists were great fun, aswell as the custom gamemodes and races, with friends there was endless amounts of content and hours you could put into it, but for the heists you also had to do a bunch of farming before being able to do all of them.

"Let me preface this that my review is mostly towards GTA online. GTA V single player is a well made game and probably worth the price despite it being 10 years old and having received zero updates or improvements.   GTA Online is still a buggy mess after a decade. I think the coding that made this game in 2013 was a shaky foundation at best, and complete spaghetti code so convoluted nothing fundamental can be improved or fixed at worst. It has been 10 years and I still get loading screens as if I'm on Xbox 360 with a HDD. It's 2024 and more times than I can count I enter a building and am greeted with loading screens for 3+ minutes before I give up and alt F4. The inventory/interaction menu is unbelievably unintuitive and frustrating to use. You have to go through 10 different options fumbling around to heal yourself. The phone call system is still obnoxious as ever. Constantly berated with calls, emails, texts, and notifications from characters begging me to do or buy something. WHERE IS THE DO NOT DISTURB FUNCTION. My mechanic takes about 30 seconds to pickup his phone and half the time can't get my car to me. This was an issue in 2013... Matchmaking is a joke. If you load into a job you will rarely get to play a full match. You have to start the match in a public lobby to actually be able to invite anyone. The awful pay for the jobs contributes to the problem as why would anyone want to play this race for $5k when there are better ways to make money. The money you earned is directly tied to how long you played so it’s better to just afk the mission than play. Original heists still require 4 people and force end the mission if someone leaves. I cannot tell you how many times I've had an error loading into GTA Online and get sent back to Storymode. WHY CAN’T YOU REQUEUE ME?   Rockstar loathes its player base. Zero communication ever. Programming cars to swerve into while driving. Nerf payouts of everything. Force players to glitch desired outfits like police uniforms and then blacklist and remove them. We can buy police cars now, but not uniforms?? I cannot believe it took a fucking decade to add police cars you can keep. Players have been asking for cops and crooks dlc for years and get only some half baked police cars. They even made the police suv a console exclusive. Arbitrary limits to the number of CEOs in an online session (you need to be one to do any mission). Add blatantly overpowered vehicles for players to grief you. Encourages players to grief you by making you a target on the map when selling stuff (you can do sell missions in solo lobbies now, only took 5 years to add but still). You have to install Rockstar launcher to play. Horribly unoptimized for online. Tanks your FPS going online from singleplayer. Poor vehicle diversity, max like 5 different car spawns. Sell missions forcing you to use 4 of the slowest vehicles in existence and drive across the map back. Die on a mission and need to retry? Any snacks and armor you used will not be reset so back out and restock or good luck. Playing with some people and you exit the lobby? Good luck finding them you are put into a different lobby. Not fun, just bad game design.   The economy is still inflated beyond belief. $5 million dollars for a police car??? $2 million for a mustang? $400k for a rifle? They have made strides in improving money making capabilities with solo heists and improved business payouts, but you have to be experienced and willing to grind. You need millions of dollars in properties to be able to make any significant money, which is why they have a starter pack. You practically need this to play if you are new. Shark cards give you a pitiful amount of money for how much you spend. (please don't give rockstar money, buy a $100 billion dollar account from modders for like 5 dollars). This game has somehow been kept alive and milked for a decade from casual players and whales giving in to micro transactions.   You think CSGO or Rust has a cheater problem? You wouldn't fucking believe the number of cheaters on PC. It's basically in the TOS that Rockstar doesn't care if you use a mod menu. They even reward them because they don't ever ban them, but will ban you if you do a money glitch. God mode glitches never get patched or banned.  There is zero punishment for cheating. Every other person is cheating. Maybe not overtly spawning spaceships and putting you in a death loop, but casually playing in God mode grinding. Abysmal security for online where modders can get everyone's IP. You played a heist and the money was never paid? Support will tell you to go fuck yourself. There isn't even an option for missing money on support, they couldn't care less.  They treat PC like last gen consoles by locking PC out of content on new gen consoles. They REMOVED 200 VEHICLES for purchase and made them available on a subscription service gta+. Animals have been added into online... for consoles only. PC has the best hardware and doesn't get the animals? Something that should've been in the game to begin with.   They just keep adding DLC with more bloat. They add so many vehicles that nobody ever uses and just keep adding more and more. The missions and heists they do add are pretty good. Although a lot of them require multiple people to play.    If Rockstar had any competition we would have had GTA VI years ago and a much better game. Instead, we get this shit show. Cautiously optimistic for GTA VI. Rockstar is a shell of its former self. The heads of the studio that made Rockstar great have left the company.",False

Their support is... not support, just a website, and the number they have just says to go to the website.

If you can get over the fact that every single online lobby has a modder or 10 in it then its great. Otherwise make your own closed friend session and have fun. Whenever you go into public lobbies and try to do any PVP the other guy just turns on God Mode and Explosive Bullets and starts one tapping you until you leave. Good game though...,True

"Delightfully addictive and hard to put down. Grand Theft Auto V offers a fantastic sandbox world to play in, with a well flowing story and expansive online mode. In regards to solo play, GTAV gives a classic story of criminal success and lets you feel like a truly powerful while letting you tap into your inner sociopath. The three main characters are by no means good people, trying to live their lives while trying to separate themselves from their pasts. Despite this, their actions would soon come back to haunt them, no matter who you play. It's by no means a masterclass in story writing, but its hashed together well enough and more than enough moments of fulfilling a power fantasy that you won't pay it much mind. Furthermore the world of Los Santos itself does what GTA as a series has always done well: Creating a snapshot parody of American culture at the time. While always crude and satirical, coming from 2013 it does have some dated aspects compared to the current year, but the game is rated M for a reason.  As for the online mode, it further enhances the power fantasy by letting you create your own self insert, meeting all the notable characters of the main story, and letting you carve your own path to criminal underworld infamy while amounting tremendous amounts of cash along the way. I will admit, I most often play in private lobbies as an introverted person, and having tried online more seriously in the past few months, it's really difficult to get a start in the world without doing a notable amount of research into what's worth prioritizing (start with the drug wars series in Sandy Shores, by the way). Additionally, and while I later learned the reason for it, it's obnoxious that after every mission I do with friends we're always sorted back into individual private lobbies or worse put into public ones. These issues aside, I delighted in roleplaying with friends online and forming our own criminal empires while snatching up businesses and running missions.  All in all, GTA V is still worth your time over a decade after its original inception.",True

"After years of hearing the hype, I finally caved and jumped into the chaotic world of GTA 5 on PC, and let me tell you, it was about time! This game isn't just a game; it's a wild, uncontrollable rollercoaster of absurdity, especially thanks to one Mr. Trevor Philips.  Trevor, the human embodiment of a ""no filter"" policy, is like that one friend who always gets you into trouble, but you can't help but hang around because they're just so entertaining. His unpredictable antics had me in stitches, whether he was rampaging through the streets in his underwear or waxing poetic about life's injustices while piloting a stolen helicopter.  The graphics still hold and are crisp and detailed, making misadventures through Los Santos a visually stunning experience. And on PC, the modding community turns this already insane game into a surreal playground where anything can happen. Want to see Trevor riding a flying bike dressed as a pikachu? There's probably a mod for that.  The storyline is gripping, but let's be real – it's Trevor's show. The missions involving him often left me in a moral grey area, but always with a smirk on my face. His dark humor, combined with the game's satirical take on modern society, makes for an unforgettable experience.  GTA 5 on PC is a masterpiece of madness, and Trevor is the cherry on top of this chaotic sundae. If you, like me, are late to the party, don't worry – the party doesn't start until Trevor shows up anyway. 10/10!",True

"I'm very late to the party. The game is old and everybody has played it or at least I'd assume they did. I picked the game up for $10 on a sale and decided to play it through since I never got around to it. Before I began the hype around GTA 6 was a-blaze on the internet and I didn't understand all these people saying that they want to play it right now. It's a game, you can wait, it's going to be just fine and nothing that will change your life.  But about GTA 5, when I started I quickly settled into it. I didn't care about online or most of the side-side-content. I did do some side-quests because they were all interesting enough and distinct enough that going through them was enjoyable. And the story even for side-quests was interesting. I have not skipped a single cut scene because I was in awe of the motion capture. It's not that it looks real life or anything, but the model for it is so well done you feel these people moving, talking and thinking. You easily bond with basically anybody because their face expressions are believable. And besides, most of the best parts of this game happen in cars where you're just driving down some highway listening to your station and people are talking. Sometimes I'd slow down just to make sure that I got to listen to everything that they had to say because the dialog is quick, snappy, people don't wait for others to finish this monologue - mostly - to start talking. And the stuff they talk about is always something you can somewhat connect to. Well not always about being a murderer, but for example you can somewhat feel how Micheal is feeling even though he is a murderer that faced no consequences and is living in a mansion doing nothing. Each of the characters are distinct and interesting, and everyone is placed in a spot where you see that they don't want to go back doing what they were doing but at the same time you see that continuing doing what they currently pursue is destroying their relationship with others. Not Trevor really, but that's beside the point.  The place where the game has it's thing down is driving, each car is different and you quickly learn which ones to pick on the street. Because of the fact that driving is so interesting and feels so complex it feels okay to be placed in those situations where you have to drive from point A to point B. At first. In the last quarter of this game driving becomes really tedious. But it does not affect the game too much to become a big problem, and the radio stations are great so you can just enjoy the music. But to be honest it sometimes also depends. When you have the vibe, enabling the first person perspective and obeying all the traffic laws while driving is really relaxing. But doing it for too long can expose the limitation in the AI of the characters that are just running/driving around the city.  The story is flesh out really well. Everybody gets their introduction and ending - maybe expect Stretch, this character is a part in the ending but you only play one mission with him. Everything comes around in a nice circle where every character is introduced, they play their part and most likely they're dead at the end. Killing off people is paced well and people that you are rooting for to be killed are written in a way to make you hate them. That way once you finally get them it feels right but at the same time it feels like these people are over the top but maybe not really once you start to unpeel the layers that make up these characters - Devin and Steve Haines. But not to make it out to be something better than it really is, the story is just good. It is strong and the characters are likeable but not something where you are DEEPLY invested in them. It is just there to serve it's purpose and to cover the fact that the game is mostly about shooting other people.  The game is long, interesting, simple and fun. Now I know why people want to play GTA 6 already. Because it's most likely going to be really fun.",True

"Grand Theft Auto V is that sandbox open world experience that keeps you busy for 200+ hours in single player or 500 hours or more in multiplayer.    In single player mode you'll find a long and beautiful campaign with over 70 main missions and 3 endings,that alone is going to take over 30 hours if you rush it but i advise to enjoy and explore everything because it's worth.  The strangers and freaks,the side missions and side activities represent a huge chunk of the game ,it's amazing how much details and work they put into these.  There is also the multiplayer,which received along the years manny content updates. I dare say there's more content in GTA Online and if you're afraid of cheaters you can create a session only for you and play it alone without some features but enough to finish almost everything by yourself.  Pros:  -Amazing story with great voice acting,huge amount of content -Multiplayer receive content updates even after 9 years  Cons:  -sometimes in multiplayer it's best to create a only friend invite session to avoid cheaters   My review score:  Story   - 10  Gameplay- 9 Graphics- 8 Music   -  9   Overall - 9",True

"Yeah so uh... love the story mode, played it on Xbox and now on PC modded with a few things to make it look better. Hate online, and when I say HATE, I MEAN HATE! Online is just... horrible. It's still filled with exploiters, toxic people and a WHOLE lot of stuff that doesn't make any sense like flying cars and bikes. Also a freaking laser gun -_-. I genuinely wish they would remove all of these OP vehicles and just make it like Story mode where your options are Tank, Helicopter, or Jet. Not to mention the PTW with the shark cards, don't even get me started on that. Deserves a solid 4, (4 stars goes to the Story mode, 0 to Online)",True

"Since there are already about a million different reviews of GTA V, with the consensus being that it's great, I've decided to forgo adding another generic review in praise of it. Instead, I'll review GTA Online as it stands in January 2024.[b] I'm marking this review as ""Recommended"", but that is entirely based on GTA V; my opinions on GTA V and GTA Online are completely different [/b][i](a big shocker, I know)[/i].    Since its launch in 2013, GTA Online has undergone several changes aimed at nudging players toward purchasing in-game currency with real money. The ever-increasing prices of items, vehicles, and properties with each game update are a push to boost the parent company's quarterly earnings rather than the parody of real-world inflation one might expect from Rockstar Games.   Online play does have its bright spots with some interesting new missions. Unfortunately, many of them are locked behind expensive properties purchased with in-game currency and offer little to no replayability. Lack of replayability may seem ironic in a game that can be categorized as grind-centric, but one gets the impression that this is intentional, or perhaps I'm wrong and it's just plain laziness on the part of the developers.   There is one significant negative that I haven't touched on yet, and that is the community, more specifically the 'modders'. I completely avoided joining public lobbies in my playing experience because the game is so infested with these individuals that it's almost impossible not to encounter some. I understand that not all of these people have malicious intentions, but enough do that it's worth avoiding the risk (and when I say risk, I mean it—the capabilities of some of these mod clients are [b]insane[/b]).   Overall, GTA Online has its moments, but the experience is diminished by things such as paywalls (specifically property missions) and modders, and I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on it.  [b]TL;DR: GTA V = Good, GTA Online = Bad.[/b]",True

"Good evening fellow Steam players. I am Dong Dong, a professional athlete and gamer for the Chinese people's republic and I am writing this review about the game Grand Theft Auto V on platforms such as Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox One.  This game resonates with me deeply. I have the freedom to do whatever I want in this beautiful masterpiece of a game, crafted by Rockstar Games. I've been playing this game a bit recently, it has helped me to cope with the loss of my family's Tibetan hound, Zonqinp. Zon was a positive influence in our household and it is sad to see him go, but thankfully I can pretend like he and his fellow deceased hounds, Qongchang and Seebodi, are with me in this digital experience.  All-in-all, this game is all I have ever wanted in a gaming experience. I recommend you to buy this masterpiece. Waiting for GTA 6 as well. Dong Dong signing off.",True

"Here is a Ukrainian Garlic Bread recipe.  For the dough:  1 cup milk (250 ml) 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet) 2 Tablespoons sugar 2 Tablespoons oil (sunflower, avocado, or olive) 3 cups all-purpose flour (380 g) 2 teaspoons salt 1 egg beaten For the garlic oil: 3 Tablespoons oil (sunflower, avocado, or olive) 3-4 garlic cloves 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh dill 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley flake salt (optional)  INSTRUCTIONS   For the dough, warm the milk until it is between 80-100 degrees F. — just warm to the touch. Add the milk to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment or to a large bowl if kneading by hand. Add the sugar to the milk, then sprinkle the yeast on top. Whisk the mixture and allow it to activate and become foamy for about 5-10 minutes. Once the yeast is activated, add the oil to the milk mixture, then add the flour and salt. If using a stand mixer, start mixing the dough on the lowest setting. Once the dough starts to form a ball, increase the speed to medium and knead for 6-8 minutes. Alternatively, knead for 10-12 minutes by hand. The dough is done when it is elastic, glossy, soft, and easily comes away from the sides of the bowl/surface. Add the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a clean, damp kitchen towel. Let the dough rise for 1-1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size. Once the dough has risen and doubled in size, punch it down to remove the air, and transfer it to a clean surface. Form the dough into a rectangle, and then divide it into 8 equal-sized pieces; weigh each one to be exact. Form each piece into a ball by pinching the edges inward, and then on a flat surface, roll the dough into a ball shape. Preheat the oven to 350 F. Lightly grease a 9-inch round or square baking dish, preferably metal as opposed to glass or ceramic. Beat the egg for the egg wash. Place each ball of dough in the baking dish, with an equal distance between each ball. Allow the dough to rise a second time for 30 minutes, or until the rolls have puffed up and filled the pan. Brush the tops of the dough with the egg wash and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until deep golden brown. While the rolls bake, make the garlic oil mixture. Finely mince the garlic, then combine it with the oil, chopped dill and chopped parsley. Brush the garlic-herb mixture over the rolls immediately after they come out of the oven. Allow the rolls to cool for 15 minutes before serving. Pampushky can also be served at room temperature or reheated.",True

"I would give this game a 5 star however, since playing it for a while now reduced it to 3 stars and not recommend it.  WHY?  Maybe I should start with the positives. 1.  ACTION packed 2. Myriad of things to do (purchases and missions etc) 3. Ability to play on or off line. (online/story mode) 4. Play together with friends.  Let's go with the negatives and my first big one is.  1. When you die, you're dead right?  Well, it seems some pansy queers get their panties tied in a knot and don't want to lose.  SHAME on RockStar which do things in 24 hour modes like getting through a bounty or breaking into the ""stash houses"", but this one thing gets to me.   When these people get shot at, or lose against you, they tend to chase you down to prove a point.  THEY ARE SORE LOSERS and refuse to lose.  So, they come after you and within the session MURDER you on and on and one.  There was one time I could not even get out of my session to go into another.    Another time this play was so close I could touch him, and I KNOW I eliminated them and low an behold, they didn't even fall and shot me once again.  Yeah, I would say 5 to 10 hits from the same person during that session/24 hour period would be more than enough.  SHAME on RockStar.  Maybe there should be a limit on how much you can be killed my ONE person during a session?  I mean enough is enough and when is too much enough?  It's like beating a dead horse at that point.  Move on losers and play on.  For Christ sake its only a GAME and that's how I look at it.  A GAME!  2. In the middle of a great win or lose battle, you get a ""network error"".  REALLY?  RockStar has a multi gazillion dollar enterprise...and it happens frequently.  I'm sure they'll blame that crap on my system...Pity on them.  3.  Little player ""clicks"" kick you out because your winning or you're not playing they way they want....cry babies.   Actually I don't mind going into other sessions....  Yeah, these are the negatives and overall will outnumber the positives if you really want to play this game.  I'm sure you got ""hackers"" in there as well.  Phantom players re-coding etc.    You wold think this company's been around a million years and would clean up some of these issues.  I mean, I know it's a cut throat game but I counted 51 kills on me and I was not even able to change my session but had to ALT/CONTROL/DELETE to shut the game down?  Yeah, it's like I said, it's beating a dead horse.  Are you dead enough yet?  The multi player section is cool if you can find other players.    Yeah, play at your own risk.  Could be a fun game though.",False

"The Grand Theft Auto series is fun. Rockstar makes really good games (RDR2 being the greatest game of all time). However, GTA5 Online is riddled with cheaters/modders that they have completely destroyed the game play experience. To the point that I'm honestly surprised there hasn't been a class-action lawsuit against Rockstar for refusing to fix the issues. They have pretty much put patches on the back burner to focus solely on GTA6. They should be sued into oblivion for allowing this to go on. If they can't put anything into GTA Online that doesn't generate money, they wont do it. This includes security patches. It should be a criminal offense what they are doing; Selling a product without fixing major game breaking issues.  Don't waste your time with it.",False

"Title: ""Los Santos' Sinful Playground: A Review of GTA 5's Vanilla Unicorn Strip Club""  Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)  Welcome to the provocative world of the Vanilla Unicorn, Los Santos' premier strip club and nightlife destination in Grand Theft Auto 5. Brace yourself for a rollercoaster ride of neon lights, seductive dancers, and an atmosphere that's both tantalizing and controversial.  Ambiance: The Vanilla Unicorn boasts a lively and vibrant atmosphere, complete with pulsating music, colorful lighting, and an eclectic mix of patrons. The club exudes a sense of decadence, capturing the essence of a high-end adult entertainment venue. The attention to detail is commendable, from the smoky ambiance to the realistically rendered pole-dancing routines.  Entertainment: The main attraction, of course, is the talented lineup of exotic dancers. Each performer showcases unique moves and choreography, adding variety to the visual spectacle. The club also features private dance rooms for a more intimate experience, providing players with a taste of the risqué side of Los Santos nightlife. While the explicit content is clearly intended for a mature audience, the animations and performances are well-executed within the context of the game.  Interactivity: Players can engage in various activities within the club, such as enjoying a drink at the bar, playing a game of darts, or even partaking in a private dance. The interactive elements add depth to the overall experience, allowing players to immerse themselves in the virtual nightlife of Los Santos.  Controversy: It's essential to acknowledge the controversial nature of the strip club in the game. While it serves as a virtual space for adult-oriented entertainment, some players may find the explicit content uncomfortable or offensive. Rockstar Games, the developers, have aimed to create an authentic depiction of a certain aspect of city life, but individual sensitivities may vary.  Conclusion: The Vanilla Unicorn is a well-crafted and immersive addition to GTA 5's open-world experience. It successfully captures the allure of a high-end strip club, providing players with a taste of the glitzy and risqué side of Los Santos nightlife. Whether you're there for the mesmerizing dance performances or to explore the interactive elements, the Vanilla Unicorn offers a unique slice of digital decadence that contributes to the diverse tapestry of activities in the game. Just be mindful of the explicit content if you're easily offended, as the club doesn't shy away from its adult-oriented theme. So, step into the neon-lit world of the Vanilla Unicorn and let the virtual decadence unfold. 🌟💃🍸",True

"i decided to purchase the game for PC (previously played on console) to relive the singleplayer i remembered so fondly.  didn't let me play the game i purchased because my social club was registered under the wrong email.  no option to switch email, or make a new one, it insisted i log in with the older email which i no longer had access to, and support ran me in circles for multiple days before outright not solving my issue, meaning i was stuck with a piece of bloatware i couldn't play, it wouldn't even launch without the login, i'm sure there was a third party way of getting around it, but i instead opted to refund the game through steam, saved me a whole lot (more) headache.  to be clear; this didn't simply lock me out of GTA online, or participating in multiplayer content, this login locked me out of the base gameplay, the singleplayer storyline, that i PAID for.  dogshit company, don't support them.",False

"Would be a great game without that Rockstar social login cancer. You buy the game on steam, you pay for it, then if whatever happens to your rockstar social login (that you did not ask for and did not know prior to buying the game), you cannot play the game anymore as your steam profile gets linked to that particular rockstar social login (that you did not want or paid for, you as a retard thought you were paying for the game, but Rockstar does not care). Anyway, one day you reinstall the game thinking you can replay it, well your steam profile got linked to that initial rockstar login, so if you can't access it then bad luck, you can't play the game!!! Can you unlink that rockstar login cancer from steam? No you can't. Did rockstar get your money? It sure did. Just do yourself a favor and don't buy it anymore. If the social login cancer returns in GTA6, just don't buy that either.",False

"I don't recommend this game after 1,000 hours because of Rockstar's insistence on lowering the quality of their product. GTA 5 is a great game, no real complaints there. GTA Online was great as of 2020. Since then they've done everything they can to time-gate progression thru lower payouts and by removal of roughly 180 vehicles. Said vehicles can still be accessed with GTA +, their new premium service. Two problems with this being, one it costs a monthly fee and two it's not out for PC. Also trying to play in a public session without modders is almost impossible. Rockstar knows about these cheaters, they've been in the game since release and little has been done about it. However, if there is a money exploit, they're quick to patch it out. If you encounter an issue online and need help good luck getting a hold of customer service, they've ripped their phones from the wall. Now you can message them and hope you get someone competent. Honestly with their recent performance I expect GTA 6 to be more of the same.  TLDR This game gets a 4/10 for quality control issues. Rockstar prioritizes monetization of the community.",False

"Very buggy on pc and Rockstar glazes the console version of this game. Heists bug out and kicks everyone youre playing with out of the lobby. For example on The Cayo Perico heist when youre trying to use the key cards on doors, your character will just stand there and do nothing. Other times guards will catch you even though you havent killed anybody and youre out of sight. Sometimes when you take the primary target it wont count and it wont be added to your payout.   If youre two people playing the Diamond Casino heist and you reach the tunnel before the vault, the game will kick both you and the other player out of the session. These are issues theyve had for a while but theyve never bothered to fix it. Theyre a half assed staff who dont care as much for pc compared to Playstation and Xbox. Some people experience different bugs than what my friends and i have, but it still bothers me that these are common issues and they dont care to fix it. I understand they are working on gta 6 but still.  Mind you ive played over 300 hours on the ps4 and ps5 version of the game and ive never experienced a bug whatsoever.",False

"I play GTA solely for the storytelling aspect. However, the story ends quite abruptly like they just ran out of budget and decided to cut it short. The last score is a letdown, it's just another heist but with a bigger cut. The final antagonists you have to kill are pretty forgettable. The map is big but feels empty, especially outside of the city. It's a step down from GTA IV in term of story. R* also never released a single DLC for singleplayer a decade later, which is very telling about their priorities.  For R* standard, this would be considered a negative review.",False

"Grand Theft Auto V is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure game that offers an immersive and thrilling experience. From the moment you step into the fictional city of Los Santos, you're greeted with a living, breathing world filled with endless possibilities.  The game's storyline follows three protagonists, each with their own unique backgrounds and personalities, which adds depth and variety to the gameplay. You'll get to know Michael, a retired bank robber trying to live a peaceful life, Franklin, a young hustler looking for his big break, and Trevor, a volatile and unpredictable character.  One of the standout features of GTA 5 is its vast and dynamic open world. Los Santos feels alive, teeming with pedestrians, bustling traffic, and a variety of activities to engage in. Whether you want to participate in high-speed police chases, engage in thrilling heists, or simply explore the city's stunning landscapes, there's always something to keep you entertained.  The game's attention to detail is remarkable. The graphics are stunning, with incredibly realistic visuals that bring the city and its inhabitants to life. The level of immersion is further enhanced by a phenomenal soundtrack, which features a wide range of genres and perfectly complements the fast-paced gameplay.  GTA 5 also introduces an online multiplayer mode called GTA Online, where you can team up with friends or other players from around the world to tackle missions, participate in races, or just wreak havoc together in the city. This adds a whole new dimension to the game, providing endless hours of fun and excitement.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece in the gaming world. It combines a gripping storyline, a massive open world, stunning visuals, and an online multiplayer mode that keeps you engaged for hours on end. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to the franchise, GTA 5 is a must-play for any gamer seeking an adrenaline-pumping experience.",True

My son won this game from his uncle, so we installed him on his computer and he started playing. Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game. This was horrible for me, because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son, because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube. So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him. I bought the game, chose my skin and world and started playing, but I was stuck in what you should do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died. Since then, this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well. This game reminded me that there is fun in everything, and I brought many happy memories to me and my son.",True

"GTA V is nothing short of a masterpiece in the world of open-world gaming. Rockstar has created an immersive, sprawling landscape that captivates players from the very beginning. From the intricate storyline to the stunningly detailed Los Santos, every aspect of the game is a testament to the developers' dedication and craftsmanship.  Despite my laptop's modest specs, the game runs surprisingly well, providing a smooth and enjoyable experience. The optimization is commendable, allowing me to delve into the rich narrative and explore the vast cityscape without sacrificing performance.  The characters are brilliantly crafted, each with their unique personalities and story arcs that kept me engaged throughout my 12-hour gaming session. The missions are diverse, offering a perfect blend of action, strategy, and humor. The attention to detail is astounding, making Los Santos feel like a living, breathing city.  Whether you're a fan of intense heists, adrenaline-pumping car chases, or simply want to roam a meticulously designed open world, GTA V has it all. The multiplayer mode adds another layer of excitement, providing endless opportunities for collaboration and competition.  In summary, GTA V is not just a game; it's an experience. It's a testament to Rockstar's commitment to delivering top-notch gaming adventures. If you haven't played it yet, you're missing out on one of the greatest gaming experiences of our time.  Pros:  Incredible open-world design Engaging storyline and characters Optimized for a variety of hardware Diverse and exciting missions Multiplayer adds extensive replay value Cons:  None worth mentioning Conclusion: GTA V stands tall as a must-play title for any gaming enthusiast. Rockstar has set the bar high, and this game continues to shine as a beacon of excellence in the gaming industry. The game is too good and the online gta is fantastic!!",True

The online is another beast entirely, going strong for almost 10 years is impressive. The online community is fairly toxic unless you have a friend group.

"I can say with 564% certainty this game is no longer worth playing. My reasons include, but are not limited to: ● Instead of focusing on removing hackers and improving the Online experience, Rockstar seems more keen on inflating costs and deflating profits (and, of course, their insatiable lust for selling Shark Cards). The amount of work that needs to be put in to getting the latest business or vehicle is extremely absurd and overinflated. You spend millions of in game dollars on a business that demands irl days worth of time dumped into it to turn a profit (and why does a mid SUV cost more than a literal super car?) ● Content disparity between current gen consoles and PC baffles me. It's one thing to have a game exclusively on one platform or console, but when the same game is missing features that you can only get on another platform? I am curious to their reasoning, but so far my money's on incompetence of their own code. One of my friends recently had to stop playing the game due to it bluescreening after about an hour of play since the Christmas update. He figured it was due to some sort of graphical overload due to the snow, but after the snow left the bluescreening stayed.  ● The constant disappointment that comes from features being added and never failing to come up short is a thing to behold. First-person GTA is something most-all players of the series have wanted for a very long time! Rockstar adds it, and the FOV is abyssal. Of course, mods can fix this glaring issue, but you have a very good chance of triggering their anti-cheat and getting your account nuked. Tow-trucks have been in the game since launch, and after 10 years they FINALLY added them! Buuuuut, it's locked behind a business and it can only be used on mission specific vehicles.  ● While it's nice the interaction menu got a face-lift recently, it's still clunky to navigate through. That, and while the controls felt good back when the game launched, are in desperate need of an overhaul. Mapping the functions of running, interacting, and answering your phone has lead to many instances of death, failure, and general annoyance (God forbid it's not an unskippable phone call). I don't care if you need your shoes or want a pizza, I'm in the middle of a literal war right now. Text me.  ● Lastly there is no Michael content for GTA Online, making it highly likely the Kill Michael option is the canon ending to GTA 5's story. There are plenty of places where Michael could have been ""the guy"" instead of this deluge of one-dimensional, quippy, tropey, uninspired characters that feel tacked on instead of interwoven. Instead of collaborating with Ned Luke (Michael's actor) for the 10th Anniversary of GTA 5, they just added a business. Meanwhile Ned is doing a play through of GTA 5 on his YT channel, I highly recommend checking it out sometime! TL;DR: Rockstar is greedy, incompetent, disappointing, lazy, Justice for Michael. Modders ruined the game, but at this point I hope they win. Fuck you Rockstar, see you in Vice City.",False

The single-player is a wonderful story that really makes you feel for these folks. However, the fact we never got single-player DLCs is criminal... eh? Hah! He he. But seriously, beat the missions and do the side stuff. You'll not regret it!   As for multiplayer, it's best to play it with friends and that is made far easier now that private lobbies have full progression now. Go to Invite Only and go nuts. There is a LOT in multiplayer.

"Trash mechanics. You may argue that its a 10 year old game.. but Halo CE original is 15 years old and the game has superb aiming and vehicle mechanics.

"I kind of think I wasted my money a bit, the graphics seem artificially capped on this PC port, with the game looking better on my Xbox 360 from 15 years ago, when you open it through steam it asks you to provide personal information to a third party service (rockstar social club) which I found creepy as hell  The first game I had online was fun, there were normal people and it was about what I expected, the next day I played I was having a terrible time being chased from hospital to hospital by guys with tanks, or weird ass laser miniguns and jetpacks, depending on the session, and when I would leave the session I would get a ""bad sport"" message, I get the feeling there were bots to keep me playing and my personal experience wasn't great.

"Honestly, I was in love with GTA Vice City. Back around 2004 it was my favorite game and I still retain warm memories of playing it. Vice City seemed to have been bustling with activities and you could always find something to do.  GTA5? A whole 'nother story for me. Don't get me wrong, the story itself is rather good... But it offers nothing else besides it. It doesn't give you -- or does a very poor job of pointing at -- interesting and meaningful side activities. I found nothing interested to do apart from doing the main story. I'm not interested in yoga and tennis, I want to explore the city, find interesting stuff while I'm doing it and experience interesting game mechanics. Most of it seem to be in the story. I personally didn't find the same enjoyment and diversity I saw in Vice City. In fact, it seems like a lot of features from Vice City were either not present in GTA V or rearranged, turning them into optional and utterly boring side activity.   Another gripe for me was Online. I'm not interested in GTA Online, but it's still included with the main game. I guess no point complaining about this, since removing it is unlikely to massively change the disk size.  All in all, if you liked GTA only for the story, then feel free to buy it with a discount. If you want something more for your experience, then you'd rather play the Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2. Especially the latter. It has all the vibes of GTA but with more diversity, more gameplay, more fun, more side activities, it's just much much better.   Hopefully Rockstar takes RDR2 experience into consideration for GTA6",False

"The game is quite interesting as a concept (free world), but badly executed and is example of how world should not look like. Let me give you examples: - There is too much unnecessery cursing. It is just annoying to say the least. Yes there could be some from time to time, but this is just too much.  - Crime is glorified and really it should not be. It would be better for main characters to fight crime not cause it.  - There is no point for Russian language and culture to be part of the game as the game is made in America.  - Too less legal activities (opening business and managing it, be part of striving for success)  I don't think this game is suitable for anyone, because it makes you do innapropriote things in worst way possible.  And it is not suitable for younger people especially not to make impression that world consists only of crime.  Yes - you may say - well this is game and in game you should do something that you would not do in real life, but this is too much violence. There are also legal and interesting things to explore that you would not do in real life. Like building a software company or something.   I hope that GTA 6 would be at least a bit better, because this is dissapointment to be honest.",False

I paid $10 for steam plus just to play online and what a waste, won't even bother since it's just littered with unaffordable dlc. Thinking back, I used to spend my time in a private lobby on online back in the day to avoid the bad players. The online could be amazing if it went back to full lobbies for heists/jobs and when the new car out was 500k and not 2 million.  It's sad that they've gotten greedy and are holding back gta 6 because online earns so much.

"honestly disappointing, generally a fun game but completely ruined by cheaters and modders online. Rockstar truly does not give a shit about their games and only care about money clearly because any sort of money cheats they immediately catch on to protect their profit margins but any other kind of cheating or modding is completely overlooked because it doesn't affect profit. These modders basically have admin powers that you would see on gmod servers in gta online. They can spawn anything, kill anyone, trap you, and boot you from the game. They basically have god powers on any server and rockstar does jack shit. They let their game rot because its still pumping out money. And thats just the game side. Rockstar themselves makes this game an endless grind through repetitive missions, missions that are literally the same as the story mode missions with even the same animations or models used. And you have to do those missions over and over to grind through level after level and slowly gain minuscule amounts of cash compared to the cost of literally anything in this game. They ask for the price of most top dollar games and then proceed to use the predatory tactics to milk even more money out of you. Rockstar is milking the game for everything its got with no regard for the people who play it.",False

"I know this is an old game, but it doesn't matter. This issue is timeless. The menu controls like a sloppy, drunk, wet cow that you're trying to control with your mind. It's absolutely abysmal.  Furthermore, let's say that you don't want to use WASD keybinds from 1990 and instead you want to use ESDF keybinds that actually make sense... well, good luck. You'll find yourself constantly running into conflicts.  Worse, if you decide like me, that I don't care about online and I just want to play the story mode, well, I'll just unbind some useless ""online only"" keybinds, right? No, no you won't. The garbage game will complain that you have keybinds unbound. You say ""yes, I know, still save."" Does it save your keybinds? No. You have to go back into the keybinds and bind every single useless keybind that you will never use because the developers are lazy and useless.  Even simple things like clicking on a graphics setting and trying to change it. It feels like I need to use telepathy to change or do anything. It runs and operates so incredibly poorly.  I hope this garbage isn't a sign of things to come for GTA VI.",False

"GTA is honestly iconic and although Rockstar has been milking Online for money over the past couple of years, the content that was available at launch and the content that was added over the years alone makes this game worth the $30 price point. Although I got bored of online after about 100 something hours, I still need to go back and fully complete the story mode because the progression and the missions never seem to bore me. The fact that you can switch between Micheal, Trevor, and Franklin throughout the story make it all the more interesting as their personalities are very different from one another and playing different missions with each character feels more memorable rather than if you were confined to a single character. Although I am not the biggest GTA fan to this day, I have to admit that it was one of the most impressive games released in the 2010s, and the fact that they continue to have a stable player base to this day means that they have made something incredible. Not sure how I feel about GTA VI yet, but GTA V will always stick with me as I grew up playing it.",True

"I'm voting this down because I have no space on my laptop to install another big game and that's partly due to GTA Online hijacking 55.9 GB of precious SSD space for no reason whatsoever. Simply deleting the dlcpacks folder will cause certain issues in story mode, so I'm not keen to do that. I guess it was beyond your knowledge and resources to make GTA Online a separate download like so many games on Steam. It puts me off replaying the game, so after installing it and not playing it for months I'm just going to uninstall it, again. I hear that's really good for the environment.  This might come as a shock to you, Rockstar Games, but not everyone is interested in GTA Online. I mean, it's a possibility that they're not even remotely curious about it. When I look at the Hardware & Software Survey for Free Hard Drive Space, I'm shocked by the amount of free space most people have, so in that sense you're in the right, but you're also not the only 100+ GB pony out there. People are making guides to trim down oversized installs on Steam, be it unnecessary language files, online content or whatever. You're probably going to repeat this with GTA VI and nothing I say or do will change that because you don't care. Why should you, right? You've made $8.5 billion off this game.

"I only recommend the single player, Online is out-dated and simple things like playing with friends is overly complicated and rife with issues. Online is a money pit, constantly begging for more shark cards to be able to do the content you want to do.  I originally played on console when it came out and the game then was a solid 8 or 9 outta 10 ( had over 300 hours on xbox 360 and xbox 1). Now i would rate single player as a 8 and Online as a 5.  just wait for Gta 6 if you want to play with friends.

We wait 10 years to get police and emergency vehicles and the pieces of garbage make the weekly challenge to take pictures of animals. So PC can't even get it. I cannot fathom to stupidity of the people working at Rockstar. And how, TakeTwo the never-ending money printer and all around consumer-haters even allow this to happen.   Mark my words, we won't even get GTA-6. Ever. I only hope all of you use your brains and do not give them your money so they can see what they're going to lose out on.",False

This was a waste of my good money. You can't even level up playing at the Casino without players you have not interacted with taking shots at the character. This GTA 5 online version is essentially a gang-stalking platform. You can't enjoy leveling up without interference from other players. Some people just want the A.i. interaction expansion online version. Not the threatening chats out of nowhere. The nonsense of so-called high level players stalking a level 4 who has not used my paid for business tycoon pack as of yet. BS,False

"Listen, I love this game, but its over run with modders and griefers, the game crashes constantly because everyone is trying to turn gta online into their own personal mod sandbox and constantly crash the session for everyone else.

Today I've played for about 3 hours and havent been able to accomplish anything because i always crash about 75% of the way into an hour long task and then back to square one.

"As a real life pilot, GTAV can be used as a great tool to practice, real world procedures, navigation, and communications. While the base game may not come with the best models for airliners, and will require you to purchase 3rd party addons to enjoy a realistic airline world, the popular Cessna 172 comes very close to what I fly in the real world. Combining the realistic Cessna with the beautiful scenery GTAV provides, and a 3rd party addon for ATC communications, like PilotEdge or VATSIM, I can create a very realistic feeling with the simulator. If I every fly an unfamiliar route in the real world, I can practice it in the sim first to get familiar with the sights I will see when I really fly, I can practice real world approaches, as well as other instrument procedures. Because the actual feeling of flying is hard to replicate, I strictly do not use the simulator to practice technique as it could create bad habbits for the real world, however while this may be true, I can still practice working procedures, and task management which sets a great foundation for myself when I return to the real cockpit!",True

"*Choosing to mod/cheat an online game with PvP = tiny pp energy* TL;DR: For the price, the single player alone is makes the purchase worth it. If you wish to play online you'll have an great time as long as you're careful in public sessions and keep your grinding in private sessions. If you're a car fan and enjoy shooters like me, this game is awesome. The online DLC has been consistently awesome however Rockstar cannot be bothered to implement anti-cheat. Console players enjoy a cheater-free experience as well as a few more features simply because they're more profitable. Pro-tip for NVIDIA owners at the end of this review :)  I decided to purchase this game in 2021 because I never actually played the single player and ended up spending close to 200 hours in it. The story of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor is second to none. This story and its game play is so good that it secured quite the profits for R* in the beginning: this game is the single most profitable piece of entertainment in human history. I'm personally very glad that the death wish ending is the canon ending, as evidenced by the events of GTA online. I absolutely love the default controls and how this game can seamlessly switch between my keyboard & mouse to my Dualsense controller. As an aviation nerd, the attention to detail when it comes to flying is incredible!!   While the single player helped R* make record-breaking profits in the beginning, it is the online component that kept this game profitable month after month and year after year to the tune of millions of dollars per month on average. Shark cards have been selling like hot cakes for the better part of an entire decade. Personally, I've never bought any shark cards and despise online cheating so 1,800 hours later my character has EARNED well over $665mil and over 6mil RP all while maintaining a K/D of 2.1. I have mastered the grind of consistently earning money and RP with most sessions netting me over 2mil. Out of principle, I refused to buy shark cards because R* REFUSES to do anything to remedy the cheater epidemic that is present in this game. The modding scene has gotten so profitable that it has been estimated to be worth millions of dollars. PC players get f*ed over because we are statistically less likely to buy shark cards compared to our console peers (follow the money) and to add insult to injury, those of us who solo Cayo Perico have been getting our primary takes significantly nerfed. By all means, make the heist more difficult, but the primary takes should pay more. R* also decided to take away the ability to fast travel via Kosatka during bike/bunker sell missions. Console players enjoy a cheater-free experience because not only do they account for a much higher profit margin for R*, but because their pay-to-play online providers do not allow for cheating on their platforms; they essentially pay a monthly protection fee. Is there fun to be had in public lobbies? Absolutely. However, one must exercise caution as modders are able to crash your game on purpose, give themselves god mode, as well as exposing your IP address which means you should use a VPN. Do all of your grinding in a private lobby and you'll be fine, but be sure to switch to a single player character once a modder starts to ""have his way"" with you!  NVIDIA users: there is an anti-aliasing method that everyone should be using in order sharpen the lines of the game. Go to your NVIDIA control panel > manage 3D settings > program settings > select GTA V on the drop down menu > multi-frame sampled AA (MFAA) set to ""on"". I have personally seen this option improve the visual clarity on lower-spec'd mobile cards as well as high-end desktop cards :)",True

I've had the game for quite a while. 5 years ago i was pretty sure I had completely outplayed it... I just played it last week and it's boring but that's coming from a player with 2k hours on steam. I migrated from Xbox one and 360 as I had pre ordered the game. I know this review seems negative but that's only due the the lack of gta 6. If you haven't ever played this you better play it because it's worth it. If your R* then F u for making me buy this game on multiple console and platforms multiple times as you avoid releasing a new game. Thats is all.   Also if you do buy it here R* has gated some content to the PlayStation so they want me to buy it again or what? (I will not),True

"The most restrictive open-world to come out of a AAA developer. It picks and chooses when to be realistic, almost always to the detriment of fun. You’re basically playing a tech demo, that tries as hard as it can to make an open-world game linear.   For a game named after a crime, and known for glorifying gangsters, it sure is tame AF. Check out these verbatim reasons for failing in-game missions:  - There was a disturbance at the showroom - You notified the neighborhood (if you make too much noise, literally seconds before a scripted event that notifies the neighborhood). - You abandoned Lamar (by getting out of a burning car?) - Tracey fled in fear - Franklin spooked a rival racer  Are you fucking kidding me?! I was half expecting “emotional damage” to pop up at some point.   Throw in telepathic, teleporting cops who materialize out of thin air in seconds, any time you fire a gun, anywhere on the map, and you’ve got a case study in wasted potential.   The gaming equivalent of paying for a fancy dinner, only to find out it’s made of wax.",False
"Traditional cannoli cream uses a sheep’s milk ricotta which I prefer - if I can get my hands on it. Any other high fat unpasteurized milk will work. Or if you want to cut some corners or are tight on time you can start off with any decent premade ricotta. Skip the low fat stuff, you’re making cannoli.  3 cups of drained ricotta  1.3 cups of confectioner’s sugar  1.5 tsp vanilla  Orange Zest  Using a hand or stand mixer, whip together these ingredients for a few minutes until well incorporated. Transfer from a bowl to a piping bag and keep in the refrigerator until ready to use.  The Shells  This is part that can easily go wrong and where you need to have a zen mindset. This recipe makes about 45 small to medium sized shells.  1.5 cups of all purpose Flour  .5 tsp cinnamon powder  1.5 tsp cocoa powder  2 tbsp white sugar  .5 tsp salt  3 tbsp cubed and chilled butter  2 tbsp Marsala  .5 tsp white vinegar  .25 cup of water  1 egg (for the wash)  Heat a neutral, high heat oil to 350F in a deep pot or fryer.  In stand mixer, combine all of the dry ingredients and mix well. Add in wet ingredients (except the egg) and continue to blend for a few minutes. Mixture will be somewhat crumbly. Remove from the bowl and pour out onto a large working surface.  Knead with your hands for 5 - 10 minutes until you have a mostly smooth and homogeneous ball of dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour.  Remove the dough from the plastic and cut into about 5 smaller pieces. Flour the dough balls gently. Pass each ball through the pasta maker, going from the widest setting down about 6 settings. Be slow and methodical, and don’t skip any steps.  Lay each sheet of dough out on your work surface and gently flour again. Using your circular punch out form, cut circles and save all of the excess dough which you’ll use for one final pass through the pasta maker.  Carefully and tightly wrap/roll each cut circle around the cannoli tube, and seal the edge with your egg wash. Be extremely careful not to let egg get all over the place. Avoid getting the egg on the cannoli tube or the dough will end up sticking to the tube while frying. Clean up any egg that gets on your work surface.  When the oil temperature has reached 350F, drop each tube into the oil and fry until golden. Using tongs, turn the cannoli in the oil so they cook evenly. This should take only about 1 minute.  Transfer to a rack lined with paper towels and carefully slide the shells off of the tubes while it’s still hot. You’ll want to use more paper towels so you don’t burn your fingers.  The tubes should be wiped down, and chilled in the refrigerator for just 1 - 2 minutes before starting the next round of shells. This avoids a lot of mess ups.  The finishing touches  Once the shells have completely cooled you can start filling the cannoli. This is made easier as a two person task and makes for a fun family activity, but is manageable by one person if necessary. Using the piping bag, fill each shell starting with the center and working outwards. Nothing worse than a cannoli with a big empty pocket of air in the middle. Once completely filled, you can garnish with whatever you like. Traditional toppings include candied fruit, crushed pistachio, or chocolate chips. When the cannoli are all dressed up and ready to go, you can give them all a final dusting of confectioner’s sugar. They should be eaten fresh as they start to lose their textural appeal if they sit around too long and get soggy.",True

"What can be said about Grand Theft Auto V that hasn't already been said a million times? This game is a masterpiece and I am blown away by how modern it feels, even 10 years after it's release. Sure, the controls can be a bit janky and the story gets messy towards the end, but as an all around experience it still holds up incredibly well. Every time I play this game I feel like I went on vacation to California. The world feels so alive and its full of many activities. The attention to detail is absolutely mind-boggling. The ""mini-games"" actually have plenty of depth to them. You can spend hours playing golf and tennis, or cruising around and taking in the sights at various beaches, mountains, and forests. Car customization is very deep and rivals every racing game out there that was out in 2013. Also a special shout out to the soundtrack which is full of every genre you can think of and ranges from old school throwbacks, to modern (for 2013) music, to even some updated recent songs that released long after GTA V came out. Although the story may not please everyone, this game has some of the most memorable characters in all of gaming. Franklin, Trevor, Michael, Lamar, even the yoga instructor, are all unforgettable characters. There is constantly something fun going on in this game and there's never a dull moment.",True

Game is fun for a couple of months but once you get rich and start owning all the items in the game there really isnt anything to do since you have every heist unlocked they need to add new heists instead of all these dumb new vehicles it got so bad for me to the point i decided to download cheats and give myself 10000B dollars because i wanted to be banned so my account could be reset to restart the game and it didnt take me even 2 weeks to get to level 50 and unlock most heists get the game its fine at the start.,True

"Grand Theft Auto V (2013)  Second GTA i ever owned in my life, the first one was GTA 3 on my old Netbook with Windows XP back when i was 9 the only reason i got to buy it on Steam despite having it on the PS3 was that it had GTA Online, pretty good online in my opinion, played it like 8 times and im still on level 5 since i got the game back in May 2023, im going to rate both the Story Mode and the Online mode now, so lets start with Story Mode  Story Mode ah yes, the Story Mode, (Warning: Includes Spoiler but im sure everyone knows already the entiry story by now) so, pretty interesting, some Heist that happend 20 years ago in 2004, bla bla bla 9 years later, 2013 and 2 of those guys responsible for the heist meet again bla bla bla, murdering and shit  i rate the Story Mode, 9 missing copies of GTA 3 on the PS3 and Xbox 360 out of 10  Online Mode: this review is too long so fuck it, 7.5/10",True

"After almost 500 hours of game-play inside and outside of Steam, I can confidently tell you that Rockstar treats it's player base horribly. So many parts of the Online experience are forced to be done solo, as they have no benefit to doing them with friends. Payouts for almost every single activity is minimal and feels like a spit in the face after you realize grinding for 100 hours will only net you disappointment. Every part of the Online experience is there to punch you in the dick and then hand you a single ice cube to make it sting a little less, but Rockstar are still the ones who did the kicking in the first place.  If you want to play this game for it's online, be prepared to ditch all public lobbies since they have at least one hacker in them at all times. All things worth doing will be done in a Crew only lobby, or in a closed mission where you can typically only bring in 3 friends. Rockstar may keep pushing horrible content updates that give you new ways to waste time, but they're never going to be worth investing your time. Do not buy this game, do not buy their next GTA, just don't waste your time with these disrespectful developers.",False

"Positive: GTA 5 is a powerful continuation of a legendary gaming series that has captured my heart since its early days. The game's strength lies in its extensive and captivating story, which can be experienced from three different character perspectives, providing the game with incredible replayability and depth. Each character is uniquely designed and contributes to a rich and engaging world full of life and adventure. The multiplayer aspect also shines with a variety of missions and activities that can be undertaken solo or with friends, creating dynamic and unpredictable gaming scenarios.  Negative: Despite the many positive aspects, the multiplayer part receives criticism for going overboard with certain elements, especially when it comes to the introduction of overly futuristic vehicles like flying motorcycles. For me, this has disrupted the realistic and down-to-earth feel that the GTA series has traditionally aimed for, creating an imbalance in the game's dynamics.  Summary: GTA 5 stands as a titan in the gaming world with a rich and dynamic narrative, memorable characters, and a fun and extensive multiplayer mode. While some elements in multiplayer may feel exaggerated, the game's overall offering is still of an exceptional caliber that few other games can match. For long-time fans and new players alike, GTA 5 offers a world filled with adventure, laughter, and excitement",True

Many people have lost their accounts to this issue for YEARS and it's STILL occurring.

"If your expecting a masterpiece based on how many people know this game and the hype that is following gta 6 then I don't recommend this game. If your looking for interesting and engaging story I don't recommend, if you want to just drive around city, stealing stuff and killing cops then I recommend the game. The characters you meet in the game are interesting and the banter is enjoyable to witness but as far as their own character progression goes there is none. Entertaining moment are sandwiched in between long travel times. The travelling does get very boring to the point where you just end up taking the taxi everywhere as it is more efficient. The open world while very lively and believable is pretty shallow and lacks content. Minus the travel times the missions are fine but each mission lacks a strong tie to the story to the point where a lot of the missions feel like filler stuff just so the gang can do interesting things. This leads to moments where there isn't something to keep you looking forward to the next thing. There is stat upgrades like better stamina or better shooting which you upgrade by using that actual stat. If you run a lot then your stamina will upgrade. Overall the upgrades are minimal and don't end up changing your play style.",False

"After half a decade of virtual penny-pinching, I finally splurged on GTA V with my hard-earned cash! 😭 I used to roll with the cr*cked, cruising the digital streets on a budget because, let's face it, my wallet was as empty as my in-game garage. Now, every pixel in Los Santos knows I'm legit. Who needs real-life cash when you can buy a virtual yacht and live your best pixelated life? My bank account may be crying, but my in-game character is living their best life. The things we do for love... and epic car chases! 🚗💸",True

"Abysmal loading times, constant crashes, full to the brim with pointless mechanics and busy work that make even the simplest gameplay convention into a chore.  The online mode is fun, but completely broken. Constant glitches, from missions that become unbeatable to expensive ammo and resources just disappearing out of my inventory for no reason every now and then.  Many official online missions clearly had little to no play testing done, and some of them are truly miserable experiences (even before you take the griefers into account). It's also grindy as Hell, but we all know that's intentional to tempt you into buying CRIMINALLY EXPENSIVE microtransactions. And let's not forget the complete lack of moderation, so hackers just run rampant to a frankly astonishing degree. I usually stick to ""invite only"" sessions because public online is just unplayable at this point.  Of course, if anything bad happens, like you get hacked or lose access to your account, Rockstar doesn't give a damn. You just can't play or even make a new account anymore, sucks to be you.  The story mode is pretty good, all things considered.",False

"My friend who I play CS 2 with said if I post a review on GTA 5, and it gets 75 likes and 30 Awards that he will buy me a RTX 3060 and 1 Kilo of Lemon . So im just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha  GTA 6 IS COMING BABY!!!!!  I am a 45 -year -old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father raising my son, who is now 14 years old. My son won this game from his uncle, so we installed him on his computer and he started playing. Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game. This was horrible for me, because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son, because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube. So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him. I bought the game, chose my skin and world and started playing, but I was stuck in what you should do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died. Since then, this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well. This game reminded me that there is fun in everything, and I brought many happy memories to me and my son.  My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on gtav and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.",True

"Grand Theft Auto V isn't just a game; it's a memory, its broken the barrier past nostalgia and become something entirely different. Every moment in the fictional city of Los Santos is a testament to the care and detail the developers have poured into this creation. It's not just the stunning visuals or the dynamic soundtrack that make this game a masterpiece, but the way it makes you feel part of an expansive, living world. The story, woven through the lives of Michael, Trevor, and Franklin, is more than just a series of missions; it's a journey through their wild lives and achieves a level of immersion that I have yet to replicate in other games today.  The heart of GTA 5 lies in its ability to offer something for everyone. Whether you're tearing through the streets in a high-speed chase, enjoying a quiet moment watching the sunset over the Vinewood hills, or teaming up with friends in GTA Online, the game seamlessly blends adrenaline-pumping action with quiet, moments. It's this balance that makes the experience so memorable. GTAV will always keep its position as top 5 games i've ever played, I remember being 11 years old with my PS3 going to that gamestop with my mom and getting the game, bringing it home launching the game and hearing that echo of the siren in the loading screen. Nothing beats this feeling and I don't think anything will come close to this for any other generation.  10/10",True

"Not very happy. Rockstar even though I chose my local storage drive decided on their own to place files on a cloud drive, now 22hrs of gameplay gone. I dont use cloud services so when i got a message saying it was fulli just deleted it and paused syncing. This is a little creepy since I never gave permission to anyone to access my onedrive account, no where did it ask. I installed to a local storage m.2 drive not the cloud. To top it off this is the third time ive bought this dam game, 1st pc, 2nd ps4, and now again pc. First time account was stolen and pc stolen at same time. Ps4 well lost all that to life problems. but now i could install through steam so fealt safe and bought again only to have it not be, and to be some real creapy like looking into places i never gave access. I looked now they got files and folders again all over the onedrive/cloud drive just from playing again and thats just messed up cause i agin said no to cloud and that said rockstar servers but idk this is just crazy",False

"These people don't know how to program a game.  Edit: The more I play the worse it gets. These people really don't know how to design a game.  Edit two: This game does everything possible to make you NOT play with your friends. It doesn't matter if you are friends on Steam, friends on Rockstars Social Club, as well as Crew Members in the game that you register through a web page. The game will STILL make it SO YOU CAN NOT PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS. Every mission, it kicks you out. Every Heist, it kicks you out. If you play a game of tennis, it kicks you out. YOU CANNOT STAY TOGETHER NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. IT'S STUPID. DO NOT BUY THIS OR GTA6. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS TRASH COMPANY! If your in a heist with one friend your other friend CANNOT JOIN your server. After you complete the heist. The friend you were with get separated onto two different servers. Even after hosting a private friends only / crew only server. Also you can't even host a private online game without first going in to single player. If you just start online mode it throws you in a random game of strangers without even asking you if you want it friends only or not. SO IN ORDER TO PLAY YOU DO THE FOLLOWING: Start single player, host a private game, wait for friends to join, do a heist, get separated into two different servers, host a private game, wait for friends to join, play tennis, leave the court, get separated into two different servers, host a private game, wait for friends to join again, rinse repeat and never actually enjoy the game.  Edit again: It keeps scattering my friends across different servers and launching games when everyone is not ready. Only 2 of my 3 friends are in the lobby and the game forces a start. Starts a cut-scene that we cannot skip, even though we've already seen it before, and so we all have to Alt+F4 to quit the game. While still struggling to get my 3rd friend into the game. Who programmed this junk? Its horrible.  Edit 1/20/2024: I don't know what they did, but now the game is even worse then it was before.",False

"What should you do to stay healthy until 2025 and be able to play GTA VI?  Sleep at least 8 hours a day. Exercise every day. 15-min walking or jogging are more than enough. This reduces risk of having a heart attack. Stay hydrated. Eat healthy. Important nutrients for eye health include vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc and omega-3. You can eat walnuts instead of potato chips while lying on the couch. Through that when walking on the street, you can see a car more clearly, notice obstacles such as potholes, sewer pipes on the ground and avoid injuring yourself. Reduce the risk of infection by paying attention to hand washing. Remove toxic people from your life. This helps to protect your mental health. If you smoke, please try to quit. Don't push anyone's buttons. You probably won't want to get beaten or killed. While it might not have a direct impact on your health, to enjoy GTA VI more, you'll need to focus on it. Stop watching porn and those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 10-second videos that ♥♥♥♥ with your skill.",True

Better don't  waste your time and money on this gave specifically ( GTA Online ) as it is full of cheaters and modders which will ruin your game play in every server that you join.

Story is good but if you come for the Online better go somewhere else as it is visible that Rockstar has zero interest in fixing the 80% modder population which feels like kings in the game.,False

"To start, I'll say this: my whole life, I've always wanted to play this. For real, that is. After all, nearly every person I knew had played it. We had it on the Xbox 360 when I was younger, and I remember I used to sneak on it, before hearing a parent coming close to the room... so I quickly exited and booted up Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga. They knew something was up, as every time they came in, I was on the title screen.  Anyway, several years later, and I've finally played through the entire story. It went by about as quick as a breeze, not because it's short--if anything, it's a decently long story--but because it was so fun. Usually every game has at least one mission that is extremely annoying, just because it's no fun to do - but this game was a gem. And if there's anything Grand Theft Auto has taught me about gems... ...it's a steal.",True

"Well, what can I say about GTA V, if not GTA V Online, which is the one I've played the most and will mention. Well, it's riddled with issues in various ways, to the point where the game is flooded with hackers everywhere. You really feel absolutely nothing when conquering a yacht or a mansion; the game is so saturated with hackers that everyone has everything, and public sessions are complete chaos. And seriously, it's no joke how many hackers there are. The other day, they put me inside a container, and I had to leave the session because I couldn't escape; the hacker kept forcing me into that container. So, reconsider spending your money on this game if you're only going to play online; it's really not worth it. Now, the story mode, on the other hand, is worth it. It doesn't have the limitations of online and even features animals and a whole living universe, unlike online. So, that's it; grab it on sale, have fun, and please, don't use hack in this game.",False

"Update: GTA Online on PC is absolute trash and full of hackers. If you report them the report is actually sent from their PC, which their mod menu detects, blocks it and makes everyone in the session unable to do anything (""You invited you to your own apartment"" screen and so ow or they just make you unable to move and blow everyone up)  And then they make you a target and keep messing up the following sessions you join.  What a poop show Rockstar.   Good game, but clearly designed as controller first, the aircraft controls are horrible on PC compared to other games. There should have been fast travel to properties player owns around the map (apart from changing spawn location and restarting session as work around). Driving to properties on other side of the map simply to check supplies/start a mission is a huge waste of  collective human hours. The session management also wastes a lot of time in loading screen/sending people from crew/friends sessions to public sessions after each mission. Rockstar must've done it to increase active game time to show for stats $. Hope this changes in GTA VI.",False

"Story: Compelling and intricate. A blessing to experience with lessons from a gritty, grim depiction of the West of Western culture.  Online: Was once a great game to play with friends and charade with randoms... but this is the PC port. Total cash-grab pricing of in-game multiplayer content turned it into 1930s German economy simulator where they prompt you to ask your wallet for permission to buy the most overrated possessions known to man -- *Virtual vehicles*  A curse no doubt conjured by the Rockstar North corporate bean-counters that analyzed the profit of holiday and birthday gift revenue coming from these aforementioned dream vehicles back in 2014. It was when missions paid a Nth of any purchasable in-game content. The grind was not worth it even when the prices mirrored the real world's retail prices of cars and weapons. Punks with dough to spend and hackers were swift to drop in and find ways to accumulate in-game currency without grindy gameplay. The well was poisoned before the water had time to collect at the bottom.",False

"Gather your friends for an exciting GTA V experience! But, caution! if you're playing solo - GTA Online has lots of hackers.

Boasts a dedicated team of admins ensuring a great gameplay and roleplay experience. Make new friends and receive cool goodies regularly from the game administration.

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) is an absolute masterpiece that continues to captivate players with its unparalleled open-world experience, dynamic characters, and immersive gameplay. Released in 2013, the game has stood the test of time and remains a shining example of what an open-world action-adventure game can achieve.  One of the most impressive aspects of GTA 5 is its vast and meticulously crafted open world, the fictional state of San Andreas. The attention to detail is extraordinary, with a diverse range of landscapes, from bustling urban environments to serene countryside and picturesque coastal areas. The level of detail in the game world is staggering, and it creates an incredibly immersive experience for players.  The game features three playable protagonists—Michael, Trevor, and Franklin—each with their own distinct personality, background, and set of skills. This innovative approach to storytelling adds depth to the narrative and allows players to experience the storyline from multiple perspectives. The character development is exceptional, and the writing is top-notch, making each protagonist memorable in their own right.  GTA 5 excels in offering a wide variety of activities beyond the main storyline. From adrenaline-pumping heists and thrilling car chases to golf, tennis, and base jumping, the game provides an extensive range of diversions to keep players engaged for hours on end. The attention to detail extends to the side missions and activities, making them just as enjoyable as the main storyline.  The game's graphics and attention to realism are outstanding, even years after its initial release. The level of detail in the character models, vehicles, and environments is remarkable, and the game's lighting effects contribute to a visually stunning experience.  Furthermore, GTA Online, the multiplayer component of GTA 5, adds another layer of longevity to the game. With a vast open world to explore, cooperative and competitive missions, and a constant stream of updates and new content, GTA Online provides endless hours of entertainment for players.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a landmark achievement in the gaming industry. Its combination of a richly detailed open world, compelling characters, engaging storyline, and diverse gameplay options make it a must-play for any fan of the action-adventure genre. Even years after its release, GTA 5 continues to be a shining example of the incredible potential of video games as an art form and entertainment medium.",True

"Not only has this game resulted in the life-long arrest of an autistic person that has never hurt anybody or intended to hurt anybody, but it also locked me out because you need a rockstar account and can't login with your steam account. I forgot the password and no longer have access to the gmail account linked to it. There's also the fact that Rockstar has absolutely RUINED GTA online by implementing pay to win aspects with overpowered vehicles that are obtained by, you guessed it, in-game money that can be bought with real life money. The only reason they never do anything about it is because having these overpowered vehicles create incentive for people to purchase those vehicles to fight against people who already have those vehicles, but what do you know, these vehicles are fucking expensive so you can either grind for these vehicles or purchase money for these vehicles. This is only made worse by the fact most of the content in GTA online costs a metric fuck ton of in-game money so you can't really have fun without investing into rockstar's most disliked industry or by spending litteral days just to afford to purchase a random fucking building to start the content chain. The grinding is made worse only by the fact that while you grind, you get called and texted by in game characters advertising the content you can't afford and the devs will constantly create more content that you can't afford.",False

"Rockstar requires that Social club is linked to Steam which seems like it shouldn't be an issue, unless like me, the Rockstar launcher is saying that an account with an email I've never made nor seen in my life is linked to the account. They won't let a new social club account sign in because it is not linked to Steam. I assume they did this to ensure I paid for the game, but the fact that I can launch from Steam should be proof enough. This is highly unethical. I've played tons of other games with their own launchers and they all let you switch to a different/new account you created after launching through Steam. I'm essentially out of my money or stuck playing offline which is not part of the original purchase agreement.   You pay for a game believing the multiplayer will work seamlessly and when it doesn't it feels like you've been scammed because you have been. Just pirate this game. I shouldn't have to look up guides, read Reddit posts, or talk to support just to get a product I purchased working. The process to recover this account is highly convoluted and the Rockstar website won't even allow me to sign in under the new account I made to contact support even though I verified my account and everything. Why even spend the money for a headache just take to the seas.  Edit  I was wrong I can't even play offline since that requires you to sign in too. Instead of launching offline it just gives an error since the Rockstar launcher doesn't work without wifi. I've literally been scammed by a AAA game company insane.",False

"I've had problems with this game, I didn't like it very much at launch: gameplay felt weird, I didn't like the characters, etc. Now that I've been playing all 3D GTA games in order, I can better appreciate the evolution of the series. This is the best GTA has played and looked ever, so much so I'd be tempted to play it all again if it weren't for GTA Online...  I'm gonna be honest, at first I was so frustrated with the GTA Online I left a negative review. I felt the game was constantly fucking me over and wasting my time. It's a rough start, but if you can survive that the game starts to feel rewarding. It's grindy though, be prepared to do the same things over and over again. Story is mainly locked behind end-game content: businesses costing millions and so on. But there are some pretty nice returns of characters from the main game here and there. GTA Online is like crack: you know it's bad for you, but you can't stop taking it.",True

Any new expansion that comes out to get you to pay for shark cards is an easy way to make money when all they need to do is add an OP car and a plethora of shitty by comparison cars, all too expensive for their own good. Avoid this game if you want to keep your salary or your job. R* knows you'll lose one or the other playing.  And... sure, it might be a great experience now, but the point is, don't pay for shark cards.",True

"Yes, for the $10 I paid for it, but it's a very flawed game, and a sign of the low standards of gaming today.  This one is by far the best GTA yet, and also still shows their failings in knowing how to advance the series. This game, like all GTA games is a fun chaos simulator. When the game tries to be serious, the flawed mechanics are obvious. It's clear Rockstar has no intention of improving them much.  The first thing I noticed is Rockstar doesn't respect their players. This was a single player series that now focuses on multi-player, and the single player game is hurt for it. The fact that different gen consoles got more/less content is also an insult to customers.   The city is by far the best they've done yet. It's vast, and beautiful, and very well realized. I love driving around in it. It's added by the fact that you can put your own music in the radio. That's something that should be a standard today. The commercials they add really make it better.   The story, and three protag concept is cool, and it works very well. I can't say I care for it, or the characters. These have never been why I played GTA in the first place. The constant bickering just wears thin far too fast.  I like the arcade feeling of the driving in this over the fish tailing of GTA 4's cars. Motorcycles are actually usable again.   Sadly, there's just so many problems with this game.  First, the game is not optimized well. On a 3070 running 1080p at 60 fps, I had to turn MXAA off to get over 30fps. It held a solid 60 until I went underwater. It would sit around 15fps underwater. This is just terrible. The standards of poor games people accept today just makes me sad.  The whole structure of the game is poor. If you want any chance of making money, you have to do the story first. What little reward there is to having all that money, is just planes and helicopters that can't really be used as all the meaningful gameplay is gone. Businesses have such a poor Return Of Investment, you'll be waiting forever for them to pay off. Cars are absolutely worthless except to look at in story mode. If you buy them, they can disappear in seconds. you can't use them in most missions because Rockstar has once again failed to innovate on their lazy programming. You go out of your way to grind money for a car, take it to a mission...and once again they stick you with the shittiest car because they don't understand how to make a game difficult. Therefore, there's no point to going after money or vehicles. In multi-player, your cars get saved. Not in story mode, because they don't care about it. They specifically devalue their own product. This is the same thing they do in Max Payne 3, where he constantly throws away machine guns to pull out a pistol. That shit's just amateur hour.  The mission structure often fails as they stick you in a position where Michael drives, and Franklin shoots. They put the characters in positions where their abilities aren't useful. This makes meaningful gameplay hard, as the game is catered against it's strengths. When I picked ending C, they disable sprint in the firefight...yep. They're that desperate to fake difficulty.  Collision physics are inconsistent. You don't know what will stop you dead, or get knocked over. This wasn't as big of a problem  in past games.  The hidden packages don't appear unless you save and reload the game. They don't tell you this, and they actually patched this is in.    The AI is dumb, and often drives right into you.  The police come when you punch someone out in the middle of nowhere....because birds call them (not a joke.) Artificial difficulty is lazy work. Yes, it's easy to lose them...but it becomes tedious time consumption for no reason. The police are very inconsistent. Sometimes a one star level takes minutes, while a two star level takes seconds to lose. They're not difficult, just annoying.",True

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) is an immensely popular video game known for its open-world gameplay, captivating storyline, and extensive multiplayer features. The game offers a vast and detailed virtual world to explore, allowing players to engage in thrilling missions, car chases, and heists. The pros of GTA 5 include its immersive and visually stunning graphics, diverse range of playable characters, and the freedom it grants players to navigate the virtual environment. The multiplayer component, GTA Online, offers an expansive multiplayer experience with numerous activities and missions. However, the game does have some cons to consider. It contains mature content and explicit violence, which may not be suitable for all players or age groups. Additionally, the game's size and complexity can be overwhelming for some, and it may require a significant time investment to fully explore and appreciate all its features. Overall, GTA 5 provides an expansive and immersive experience, but its mature content and complexity should be taken into account before",False

"GTA Online is the worst online multiplayer experience ever. It almost feels like a game such as GTA should never have online features. Half the time I feel like I was in a boring dream. Missions, heists, and what not take too long with redundant driving from one point to another and lack of vehicle spawn. If your chopper blows up in the middle of the desert, you're d o n e, fucked.   Yes, some deathmatches, races, and all that events can be fun, but if I wanted to play those game modes, I'd rather play other games. As for the heists, the thing that gets you a lot of money quicker, it's like being tortured more painful than when Trevor tortured that dude. For one, connection errors are more common to encounter than the actual players who are willing to join the heist. What worse is that once you've got some players ready, and you finally get to hear the mission instructions, your fellow crew mates would grief the fuck out of you with all that hack, trainer, or some shit. Sure, that sure sounds like fun. The heists/mission are very long with the long drive and thousands of npcs to be killed, so it makes sense if you need other players as they might help you travel faster and kill npcs faster. Truth is, you can't rely on other players for helping you because most likely they'd rather be trolls. I know I can play with friends and family, but they are smart enough to avoid this shit.  Money is important. So important that you need money to have fun in the game. Some missions/heists requires you to buy some properties. To earn money you should do contract mission or events. these contract missions/events don't even get you loads of cash. Meanwhile, the properties you need to buy are way too expensive. Luckily, these contract missions/event can be done in solo; however, even so, the missions are made for multiplayer so it takes so long. Wait, whats this? oh, you can buy money with money! That's right! You want to buy these in-game properties to enjoy the additional missions, but you don't like grinding for money because it's boring? Just give Rockstar your cash!  Seriously, I would prefer Rockstar to make dlc(s) to the main game for additional gameplay, stories, and in-game stuff than this online bullshit.",False

"Gta is a very fun game to play and enjoy with ur friends, their is also many mods like LSPDFR you can play as a cop,swat,millitary,Fbi and many more. You cana also install FiveM and roleplay with other players in real time, you can be a gang member,millitary,fbi,swat, police,civ,you can also even havea  job, this game (fivem) is very fun because the cars,sounds are very realistic, this game evne has proximity chat, Which means when ur very far from a player you cannot hear them (like real life) but when your close to them u can hear them better the closer you get,  also Fivem is fun because you dont get a watned level by the cop npc's, you get a wanted level by the real pollice players!!! which means when you unalive a lot of cops you lose them, unlike gta v with the cops the more you kill them ore they come. an also you can roleplay robberys such as a bank,gas station.",True

"Rockstar is nothing but an ignorant company in the topics of their player base and how cheaters are almost in every single damn server of GTA Online. Every day and even every minute they ruin people's fun time and gameplay which makes GTA Online itself unbearable but ofcourse Rockstar games isn't so willing to put up an anti-cheat programme just because for whatever reason as if they claim that GTA Online and their player base is not-so-important and just like they let go of Red Dead Online, they are slowly letting go of GTA Online because their incompetence and hunger for money is higher than the values they give towards the game. So if you are here for online, get ready for a hot and ready disappointment at your monitor being delivered to you personally. Because Rockstar Games letting people ruin their game. They don't even give a shit about reports, i have personally reported many cheaters, sometimes even same guy over and over again for coming up to me later on and ruin my game or crash it.",False

"GTA V Story Mode: 5/5 Stars  - Story is epic; each character has a lot of in-depth individual stories, about who are they? | Gameplay, from gunplay to driving a vehicle, is enjoyable | Map size is okay | Game graphics, beautiful from 2013 until this day.  - But they should make your bought car not disappear when you leave it. Instead, it just returns to your garage.  GTA Online: 3/5 Stars  - uhhhh.. Grindy... and a mess  - When I joined the public session mostly, I was bombarded with people in chat advertising their mod menu, or sometimes moderators jailing your character so it could not move, ruining lobby sessions and business missions. There were some friendly moderators that helped me with business missions. (Invite only session is better.)  - So back in the summer update, when they gave GTA 5 free on Epic I grind ""business mission"" just selling cars and leveling up and character stats to profit. ;)  ;)   - Mainly playing online just to have fun with friends playing Heist.

"Very low expectations for GTA 6 after spending less than a month with this lightly-polished turd.   Offline/Story mode is way too short, and there's not enough story for each character. They all just feel like side-characters with a little extra screen time. What little of them is added to Online doesn't make up for this at all, nor does all the extra side crap in story mode.   Online is the real dumpster fire. A lazy, even more buggy, stupid excuse for a cash grab built around a bunch of badly-implemented good and bad ideas and designed to spread and induce toxicity and punish people for trying to get away from that crap. Rockstar are abusing every mental manipulation they can to try to keep people playing, but anyone who does so must just be desperate for something to do because it is boring AF playing the same crap for disproportionate effort vs payout in so many different forms, getting grief'ed constantly in public lobbies no matter how peaceful you are, and etc.   Between this and the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition BS, Rockstar has officially justified pirating their games, but in reality everyone is better off just avoiding this bloated, corporation-focused shadow of what was once a good game studio entirely. Long live III, VC, SA, IV; because V killed GTA.",False

"One of the most annoying worst online experiences even if you are part of the problem. Basically Rockstar is never going to stop their hacker problem and they actually treated them to a special Christmas event. And people can still do whatever they feel. Playing this game online is like being a criminal basically. Don't be a criminal kids. There needs to be legal laws to ban rockstar from having and advertising these servers. They are broken and unplayable. Long loading times, nobody who is a legit gamer plays this game online. Everyone is no joke just made because my K/D is 11,000 players in 4,000 D basically now the tables changed. People can't admit they get mad when someone gets them over their skill. Now they use hacks because the last person did. So do not buy this game for online, You will waste your time, and rockstar will not do anything about it.

"-={ 9 / 10 }=- Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece of open-world design, storytelling, and sandbox freedom. Its immersive world, complex characters, and darkly humorous narrative provide an unparalleled playground for virtual crime sprees. While its mature themes and occasional mission hiccups might deter some, for those willing to dive into the gritty underbelly of Los Santos, GTA V is an unforgettable experience that leaves a lasting mark long after the final credits roll. Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility... and a healthy dose of explosives for when things inevitably get chaotic.  -={ GAMEPLAY }=- Living, breathing sandbox: Los Santos and Blaine County overflow with vibrant detail, from bustling city streets to sun-baked deserts, offering endless opportunities for exploration and mayhem. Three unforgettable protagonists: Michael, Franklin, and Trevor are more than just playable characters; they're flawed, complex individuals with motivations that twist and turn as the story unfolds. Cinematic storytelling: From pulse-pounding action sequences to darkly comedic exchanges, GTA V delivers a rollercoaster ride of a narrative that rivals Hollywood blockbusters. Unparalleled online playground: GTA Online extends the experience with a constantly evolving world of cooperative heists, competitive showdowns, and player-created chaos.  Mature, often offensive content: Violence, nudity, and strong language are abundant, making GTA V unsuitable for younger audiences. Mission design can be uneven: Some missions feel repetitive or frustrating, occasionally breaking the narrative flow. Microtransactions in GTA Online: While not pay-to-win, some may find the optional in-game purchases for faster progression intrusive.  -={ PRICE }=-",True

Some will give you free money but most will turn on god mode, turn invisible, and then automatically taze everyone on the server 10 times/second so you cant move. or theyll telport everyone on the server to them to kill them.   Even when the games not being ruined by cheaters its ruined by rockstars own bugs. trying to quick join a heist will put you on a never ending loading screen more than half the time.

"Grand Theft Auto V stands as a towering achievement in the world of gaming, offering an open-world experience that's as exhilarating as it is expansive. Set in the sprawling, fictional city of Los Santos, this game seamlessly blends action, narrative depth, and boundless exploration.  From the moment you step foot into this virtual metropolis, the attention to detail is staggering. The city feels alive, teeming with a diverse population, bustling streets, and a vibrant ecosystem that reacts to your every move. The level of immersion is unmatched as you navigate a world that feels as dynamic and unpredictable as our own.  But beyond its stunning visuals and vast open world, it's the intertwining stories of three distinct protagonists that elevate this game to greatness. Michael, Franklin, and Trevor each bring their own flavor to the narrative, offering a multifaceted perspective on the criminal underworld and their intertwining lives. Their stories intertwine seamlessly, providing a rich and engaging storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The freedom this game affords is unparalleled. Whether you're causing mayhem in the city streets, engaging in high-speed pursuits, or simply soaking in the details of a sun-soaked skyline, there's always something to do. The breadth of activities, from adrenaline-fueled heists to leisurely rounds of golf, ensures that boredom is never an option.  Furthermore, GTA Online extends the experience far beyond the single-player campaign, allowing you to dive into a persistent multiplayer world. Collaborate with friends in heists, compete in races, or simply revel in the chaos of the open-world sandbox with countless other players.  In summary, Grand Theft Auto V isn't just a game; it's a living, breathing universe of its own.

"was actually able to play the game for a while before getting off for like 6 months, when i try to log back in the initializing bar is in the bottom right and im just sitting waiting for hours, dont get this game because if you log off for more than 6 months GTA 5 the game itself just breaks and  you cant play it and all i wanted to do was play story mode so i could get my moneys worth of the game now im just considering on refunding the game but i still want to play GTA 5 on pc if anyone knows whats happening pls comment i guess",False

"Broken, outdated and addictive.  Publisher and Devs are just trying to squeeze as much money they can out of you.",False
this shit bussin,True
"Grand Theft Auto Online, the multiplayer counterpart to the iconic GTA series, has unfortunately become a prime example of a game suffering due to profit-driven decisions by its publisher, Take-Two Interactive. The experience in GTA Online feels less like a player-focused venture and more like a relentless pursuit of monetization at the expense of player enjoyment.  One of the glaring issues is the inordinate focus on microtransactions. Take-Two seems more interested in squeezing every last dollar out of players than delivering a balanced and enjoyable gaming experience. The exorbitant prices for in-game items, coupled with the grind-heavy nature of the game, make it clear that the primary concern is the virtual wallet rather than player satisfaction.  Updates and new content often prioritize expensive in-game purchases rather than addressing core issues and improving the overall gameplay experience. It feels like Take-Two is pushing players toward spending real money to stay relevant in the game, creating a sense of frustration and exclusion for those who may not be willing or able to invest additional funds.  The rampant presence of hackers and modders further compounds the problem, creating an environment where legitimate players are left to fend for themselves against unfair advantages. Instead of addressing these concerns, Take-Two's focus appears to be on releasing new, money-making content, neglecting the need for a fair and secure gaming environment.  In conclusion, the current state of GTA Online reflects a disheartening prioritization of profit over player satisfaction by Take-Two Interactive. The game has devolved into a grind-heavy, microtransaction-laden experience that often leaves players feeling frustrated and alienated. It's a stark reminder that a game's success should be measured by more than just its financial gains.",False

"In the city of Los Santos, a young hustler falls under the wing of a former criminal living a difficult retirement. Circumstances lead to the pair to have to do a job to pay off a debt – a job which gets national coverage and draws unwanted attention from a former partner, corrupt cops, ruthless movie moguls, rival gangs, aggressive fitness fanatics and many others.  I have played this game series on and off over the years but (criminally) did not play the former one based in Los Santos but instead rejoined with GTA4, a game I enjoyed but not one without its flaws. The good news with V is that the game keeps the strengths of the fourth game but makes many improvements which produce a much more fun and enjoyable experience across many aspects. The first thing to say is that the world of LS is technically amazing in terms of its attention to detail and beauty – it is hard to describe to people who decide they do not like these games, but to see a glorious sunset from a hillside, with perfect shadow effects and vegetation movement and know that someone designed and made this, not just filmed it, is something that hit me over and over throughout the game. The map is enjoyably large with diverse landscapes and character and I still find great pleasure in just going around in it even if I have nothing specific to do.  The story is solid enough for the game even if it is rather generic and overblown. The characters are quite clichéd in some regards. Michael's story for instance is not so imaginative and generally I found him the least of the characters. Franklin is similar but covered by him being the ""intro"" character, so I stayed close to him throughout. Trevor is a wonderfully violent and funny character and his entrance is memorable and really shakes the game up. The events of the story are necessarily overblown but this is part of the fun and generally I liked the flow to it. The many supporting characters are great fun and the energy and color of it all does cover up for the fact that the story is not really that complex or engaging at times. As it is though, it is about events and set-pieces and the game provides plenty of fun memorable missions (admittedly as well as a handful of awful ones), and in this way there are loads of missions to replay and enjoy and, most importantly, this game actually allows you to load them to do just that.  Side missions add color and fun and, although I do miss ongoing missions like the vigilante ones from IV, there is still plenty to do. The range of vehicles adds to this and I also enjoyed how much easier they are to drive than in the previous game. Weapon customization and the range of them provide fun destruction, although the police are a lot more aggressive in this game than in IV, so it is harder to go on a rampage and make it last. In theory the Online world offers endless gaming – I tried it for one evening and it was fun despite all the issues, but the community seemed messed up and very reliant on having an existing group of players – it looks fun but I'm just more of an offline player these days.  Grand Theft Auto V is a great game, even if you ""only"" play the days and days of content in the single player game. Technically the game is astounding with its attention to detail and just the sheer beauty of the audio and visual design of the whole world. The plot is solid enough to do the job while the characters (main and supporting) are colorful enough to engage while playing through missions which are mostly enjoyable and offer plenty of big set-pieces that are overblown and fun.",True

"The online is an absolute joke, Riddled with modding trolls who crash your game, lock you in cages, run around with god mode teleporting you around. For every maybe 50 modders you'll find one that isn't nefarious. Every single online lobby has modding trolls in it and if you're lucky to find one without them, it will only be a matter of time before one joins. Rockstars solution? Invite only sessions which turn online mode into just a buggy extension of the story mode.  On top of that the latest chop shop update is riddled with soft locking bugs that require you to restart the game and start missions over again just to be able to complete them. For one of the most profitable games in gaming history you would think they would hire some professional game developers but apparently there's not many competent coders in the gaming industry anymore. I could write code at 13 years old more stable than this embarrassment.   Tldr: If you want to play online just find an RP server to play in, those server owners care about their private servers more than Rockstar does their own game.",False

"""Grand Theft Auto V: A Timeless Triumph in Gaming Excellence""  Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  Grand Theft Auto V stands as a towering achievement in the world of gaming, a testament to Rockstar Games' unrivaled ability to craft a virtual experience that transcends entertainment. Even years after its initial release, GTA V remains an absolute masterpiece, continually drawing players into the vibrant and chaotic world of Los Santos.  From the moment you step into the meticulously crafted city, the level of detail is staggering. Los Santos is a living, breathing entity, pulsating with energy and realism. The game's visuals are a feast for the eyes, showcasing Rockstar's commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in an open-world setting. The attention to detail, from the bustling city streets to the serene countryside, is nothing short of awe-inspiring.  But what truly elevates GTA V to legendary status is its narrative brilliance. The intertwining stories of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor create a narrative tapestry that is as compelling as any Hollywood blockbuster. The characters are richly developed, each with their own motivations and quirks, making them more than just protagonists – they're complex, flawed individuals you can't help but invest in.  The heist missions, a hallmark of the GTA series, are the epitome of gaming excellence. The level of strategic planning, coupled with the freedom to execute plans in various ways, provides a sense of agency rarely seen in other games. Whether you're orchestrating a daring bank heist or engaging in high-speed pursuits, the gameplay is a perfect blend of challenge and sheer fun.  GTA V's soundtrack is a work of art in itself. The radio stations boast an eclectic mix of music, catering to diverse tastes, and the original score seamlessly complements the on-screen action. The attention to audio detail, from the roar of engines to the ambient sounds of the city, further immerses players in the game's world.  The longevity of GTA V is also owed to its dynamic online multiplayer mode, GTA Online. This ever-expanding world offers limitless opportunities for cooperative and competitive play, ensuring that the Grand Theft Auto experience extends far beyond the confines of the single-player campaign.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V isn't just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon that has left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape. Rockstar Games has crafted an experience that transcends its medium, delivering a perfect blend of narrative depth, visual splendor, and engaging gameplay. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the series, GTA V is an absolute must-play – a timeless triumph that continues to redefine the possibilities of interactive entertainment.",True

grand theft auto v.... the reason that my review took so long is because i always 100% my games before writing a review for them so here it is i guess the story of grand theft auto v has aged very well after all these years and its nice to visit it after a while but unfortunately not everything else so if someone installs the game and only plays through the main story and a few side missions its a very solid experience but the collectibles and the side missions have such a dated and a not fun design to them that really drag this game down like the fact that the game doesn't tell you which stunt jumps are remaining or where is the alien piece and etc. and don't get me started on gta online i swear to god i never had a worst online experience in all of my years as a gamer and the fact that a lot of the achievements are from gta online just made the whole process so much more tedious  i never want to touch gta online ever again  i think the story is solid enough to justify buying this game but if you love your sanity dont go for completion or online achievements,True

"My 18 year old ask me to reinstall the game and in doing so I noticed that I had yet to review the game.  We have at the time of this review over 320 hours play time on the PC, with nearly double that on the PS4.   Funny thing is that we have never even completed the story campaign or played on the online portion.   The vast majority of the time was just my daughter and I making tons and tons of mayhem.   Well more me making the mayhem and her going on joy rides.  For years now she has asked me when GTVA 6 was coming out and she was so glad to hear that it was finally coming out in a couple more years.  I don't care what people say I am glad for her that she will finally have a female anti-hero to play as.  In the past we have always modded the game just so she could play as a female character.   I tire of people saying a game is ""woke"" just because it has a female lead.  Grow up and get with the current century is what I have to say and I am in my fifties so it isn't like I am a Millennial or Gen Z saying this.   If you don't like the character being female, do the opposite of what we did and mod the character to a male.  Anyway, it is amazing how much fun this game is just driving around and sightseeing even after all these years the game still holds up as a decent looking game.  Rockstar put heart and soul into the game and it shows.  By the way if you ever get a chance to meet Steven Ogg (voice of Trevor) in real life, do it.  The dude is hundred kinds of funny and a cool dude all around.",True

"I had to request a refund because I couldn't even get to the game.   Trying to launch the game starts a launcher where you have to create an account and give personal information. That alone is very annoying, but I went through the process and thought that was that but I was sorely mistaken. After setting up an account and verifying my email, the launcher asked for an activation code and it provided no information on where to get it. I looked up online and apparently you can see this code if you log in with the created account on the rockstar website. I tried logging in and I was met with the worst captcha I have ever seen.  The captcha is very difficult, you need to match randomly generated rooms with several objects to a black-and-white map of the correct room layout. That is already challenging by itself, but the kicker is you have to do it 10 times. So I did my best and submitted their captcha 10 times. At the end it gave me the message ""That was not quite right"" and I had to start over.  I tried a couple more times but in the end I gave up and asked for a refund.  I don't understand why game publishers put these hoops to play their games, I already paid you so just let me access your game ffs.",False

"At a discount, I totally recommend this game. It can be a fun bit. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the mark for me, it becomes too repetitive. I feel like I spent most of my time in the game driving around the city.   The characters lack depth, appearing rather one-dimensional. Although they're intended as satirical figures, I found the critique of society lacking due to a lack of insightful storytelling. The excessive violence and torture felt out of place, lacking context and purpose, devoid of any impactful consequences. Some side missions were entertaining, yet others felt mundane and offered little reward, contributing to an overall weak storyline. Despite moments of entertaining banter between characters, there was a notable absence of character progression, leaving them seemingly unchanged from the game's start to near completion (I stopped right before the final heist).  Investing in properties within the game felt pointless; the money spent never returns, requiring an extensive grind to acquire them all, which didn't appeal to me.  Although there were enjoyable moments in the game, there were also instances where playing it left me with a sense of discomfort or unease. I won't delve into the portrayal of women in the game as objects or unable to exhibit ruthlessness. However, I found the inclusion of the therapist character puzzling. Was it intended as satire? Therapy remains taboo in many societies, so why not explore that notion? Why not play with society's perceptions of therapy? Instead, it seemed evident that the therapy sessions in the game were not genuine therapy but rather another aimless story arc, leaving me questioning its purpose and significance.   As for the online mode, it could potentially be enjoyable with friends. However, the high cost of items and the grind required were significant deterrents. While the concept of owning businesses seemed promising, the execution made it more of a chore than a pleasure. The delivery missions were time-consuming, the process of checking supplies at businesses in person felt tedious, and the excessive hours needed to play repetitive missions for incremental progress towards a new and improved business felt unreasonable.",False

"Rockstar hates it's fanbase.  No singleplayer content updates in a decade. In multiplayer its so tedious and lengthy to grind money for vehicles businesses, and they do this on purpose so you will bend and buy Shark Cards for real money. So naturally, everyone just cheats and hacks for money or vehicles that they want. Rockstar responded by adding the MK2 oppressor, which made it so griefers can kill you freely time and time again.  The game also has no anticheat, so expect to be trapped in cages, teleported, and having your whole ass game bugged and crashed for making the mistake of joining a public lobby.   Game takes forever to load, which makes it even more painful because 7/10 times you will error out, be sent back to singleplayer, then have to rejoin multiplayer. whole process to launch the game 5-10 mins on good PCs.  Cayo Perico is the only really valid option for earning good money, which is a pretty cool heist but gets old grinding it time and time again. I dont have a problem with grinding in games, but when it revolves around driving 3.8 miles across the map to the same spots time and time again its just boring.  at least they brought back beloved features from GTA 4 and Vice City, like Vigilante missions!! oh wait... actually nope it took them 11 years to even add cop cars you can own, and still no vigilante missions.  Will Rockstar learn from these mistakes in GTA 6? doubtful, they make $2.5 million per day off Shark Cards. why change a winning formula?",False

For me, my breaking point has been them showing us how fun this game could be with the cayo perico heist where you can make all the money you could want just for them to go back around and stomp it into the ground again because they wanted more money from sharkcards. Not to mention the fact that they thought doing that was a better idea the fixing the rampant cheating problem. This game has become a shell of what it used to be. Its just a fat bloated pile of shit begging you for more and more money.",False

"Saw the GTA6 trailer, was very impressed, found out this was on sale for all of $10 including GTA Online. Scooped it. And I couldn't be happier.  The game is over 10 years old as of this commentary and I never got to play GTA4 yet, so it's been an enormous gap since I played GTA:SA on the PS2 (for reference, I've played since the very first GTA on the PS1, along with GTA2, GTA3, and GTA:VC as well).  The level of depth and immersion blew me away and would have had my teenage self floored because I played the older titles for their immersion. The story was so much fun to unravel, and I especially loved the Trevor character. The sheer amount of things to do were so many that I probably won't be able to 100% this game any time soon. But what really struck me was how faithful they were to referencing their older titles, including a car from GTA2 which is like the bastard child of the franchise it seems.  It's all the fun and frantic open-world destroy-everything GTA was always known for, with a massive city and a more rural county, chock full of weapons to play with, a load of cars of all different types that don't look repetitive after a while, new minigames and RPG elements,  The only sad thing is that, unlike GTA:SA, they had to remove the cities of San Fierro and Las Venturas, because that would have just made the world map so immense that this game would probably be so much bigger to install than it already is now. Still, with how deep they have been going, plus what I saw with the GTA6 trailer, who knows if they'll make some kind of alt-USA travel system to do this sort of thing and interconnect them along with Liberty City and Vice City (I'm looking at you, GTA Online).  100% recommend. It's the 5th major installment of a beloved franchise and it really delivers its entertainment, especially if you're into open-world immersion.",True
"From a singleplayer perspective, the game is nothing short of an excellent experience, the story isn't the best in the series but is a great parody of modern america. Each of the three characters have their own narrative that collides with each other to feel unique and relevant to the main plot. The choice of endings are obvious and not necessarily compelling which leaves a half baked finish to the game. But the first 2/3 of the game have excellent character development and writing. The open world is great but feels empty. Its more or less a travel hub to go from point A to point B, but has a good level of detail and almost every part is used productively. The online portion of the game sucks and is boring, using the same open world as single player with very few things different or interesting to see and do. Unless you have a small army of people to play with, multiplayer is a cash grabbing joke. The whole of the single player is what holds up to this day. 9.0/10",True

"EDIT: After playing all this time on GTA online ive come to the conclusion that this game is absolutely killed by hackers and mod menus, GTA online does not feel like a safe game to play and for that reason I cannot recommend paying for this product. I personally like playing in closed sessions enough for it to be playable but if I had known how bad this hacking issue was I probably never would have paid 14 bucks for the game. Any time I am in a public PC session I have distortion effects on my screen, am being teleported all over the map or am being bothered in some other way by a hacker. They will make you randomly explode when walking, invert your screen and basically play god while rockstar only bans those who abuse the in game currency and have no care for the well being of their players or the experience they have online. Great single player game, absolutely horrible online experience and it has made me realize that I need to see this fixed when GTA 6 comes out or i will not be purchasing it.   Been a few years since ive played GTA V and last time it was on a ps4, coming back now in 2023 its almost like a new game online in some ways. Very good game overall and honestly its still worth 60 bucks even after 10 years of its original release date. Fun solo, fun with others and lots to do either way with what is still one of the most immersive cities in gaming even after a decade.",False

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) stands as a true masterpiece in the gaming world, combining a sprawling open world, gripping storytelling, and an unparalleled level of detail. From the bustling streets of Los Santos to the vast countryside and beyond, the game's world is a vibrant playground filled with limitless possibilities.  What sets GTA 5 apart is its seamless blend of action, exploration, and narrative. The game's three protagonists offer unique perspectives, each with their own compelling stories and motivations, creating a rich and engaging experience. Whether embarking on adrenaline-fueled heists, exploring the diverse landscapes, or simply causing chaos in the sandbox world, the game ensures there's always something exciting to do.  The attention to detail in GTA 5 is staggering, from the lifelike NPC behavior to the meticulously designed environments. The game's multiplayer component, GTA Online, further extends the experience, offering a dynamic and evolving online world where players can engage in various activities, missions, and challenges with friends or other players worldwide.

"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  So not so recently Rockstar are slowing down and probably going to stop handing updates out to PC version of this game so if you really want to play go and play on a console while they still get updates.  Now why you shouldn't buy it really at all. Imagine this game is what we think of when we recycle a bottle, it get crushed down, a few bits of extra glass gets mixed in from somewhere and then turned into a new bottle. But at the core it's basically the same bottle. This is every single GTA update. Every one is recycled content. Ooo new mission added? It's basically drive, shoot a few people, look for a tiny thing not marked on the map drive miles back rinse and repeat. Want to earn good money? Either cayo or agency is your best bet, which would be fine but every damn mission is the exact same. All you're doing is the same thing over and over. It doesn't even feel like grinding it just feels like soul sucking stuff,  Rockstar are the worst. This game places first for most popular and most profitable game in the world. Breaking most records ever set. What do they do in return? Add subscription services, nerf money making methods, like cayo, prioritise consoles over pc, because Rockstar earn more from consoles than from PC, and increase the prices of everything while also nerfing vehicles and other things. I didn't even mention the fact they removed over 100 vehicles from the store only to make it so that GTA+ subscribers can get them. The worst part? It almost feels like a cult. You mention Rockstar is bad and have no shortage of evidence of this and then you get all these Rockstar supporters coming out of the woodwork telling you how you're wrong and Rockstar is better than god.  Yes I have nearly 1000 hours in this game and yes I still play from time to time but this is me telling you do not waste your money on this game on PC. Probably don't waste money on this game at all  Also Rockstar don't care. The game is full of modders and racist people and they don't do anything about it. Honestly one of the worst gaming companies going  TL/DR: Don't buy on PC - Rockstar bad - Everything sucks",False

I see many differences in shapes, many differences in contrast.   My 2 gripes: Modders are a big thing in this game, expect to run into one or two a day. Also, some cutscenes have little to no work put into them, meaing that they are still good, but Rockstar apparently forgot to remaster certain parts. But don't worry, you won't see it often.

I'm not playing online, this shit should be opt out.  Second of all, to even log in to my Rockstar account, I have to go through multiple captchas (that will fail if you get even one answer wrong) that consist of 16-18 rounds of advanced spatial matching or 10 seconds of audio that you have to categorize.  Third of all, it won't even launch without 5 minutes of loading on a R symbol just to tell me that the game has already been launched, before quitting. Useless.  Fourth of all, get rid of the dog shit launcher. No game has EVER benefited from a launcher, save for perhaps MInecraft, where you need multiple profiles for different versions and mods.  I expect an AAA game to launch and work out of the box. What did I get? Half an hour of absolutely nothing. This game has been out for 10 years, and yet, somehow, it still needs work.",False

"THE ONLINE IS TOO FRUSTRATING AND A MONEYGRAB  The singleplayer is an ok a regular gta game (story 8 to 10 hours of play maybe a bit more) where its ok till you have mission to earn money but when you finish them its a problem to earn (unless u go trought all the trouble of doing the investments in shares in the ingame interenet before the heists which is a PITA you need to do with a youtube guide)...(there are singleplayer cheats but not the money cheat like if the developers wanted you to feel poor and frustrated....)  online its just a nightmare it feels like a work but sorry im here to play not to work or i would have stayed extra hours at a real job, you start with nothing and you are going to get killed by other players a thousand times untill you get in private game to advance with some online missions and earn something so u can buy the basic weapons, but some missions cant be done without players in the game so you are forced to play with griefers (people that will purposelly ruin your mission because you cant literally do nothing against them when you start for lack of equipement) and cheaters which has filled the game and makes planes rain over u or just crashes the game spawning too much stuff or run around in godmode fucking everything up) and not only that it takes u soo much time to earn with missions that is as frustrting as a real job you dont like, and when you buy one of the basic things that you need to protect yourself from other players you are back to zero, unless u buy the in game money... with real money... -.- or u are lucky enough to find a hacker that drops money on you but guess what? if someone gives u money he is porbably gonna be banned and u too, but if you cheat without giving/touching the money no problem no bans, u can crash servers no one cares....  -.-'       i have been playing for a few years and i have seen those problems only getting worst, 1227.5h of play almost all online and more than 3/4 of it was just tring to earn ingame money without having fun to buy what i needed, i totally understand why cheaters are growing...  I tell you people dont buy this game and dont buy the next one from this developer they dont deserve your money, this shiny garbage has been made to suck either money out of you or all of your free time and patience, the next one will be no different.....dont feed the sharks people or more will come.....and no more fun games will be made just frustrating moneygrabs that looks appealing......",False

"[b]""[i]Why did I move here? Guess it's because Steam. You see.. screenshots, artwork, review, discussions, and guides. So, I bought it this year and I'll upload everything I have in mind.[/i]""[/b]  I rarely play the story mode, so I just go directly to Online mode to play with friends, doing heist and stuff. But after I bought it on Steam, I decided to play the story mode. Though I didn't finish all the random events / Strangers & Freaks, GTA V's story amazed me. Each mission, Each dialogue, Each moment is abso-fucking-lutely Grade-A. 3 protagonists with their life-stuff-problems to tell; A gangbanger, a father formely bank robber, and a fucking psychopath yet loyal become involved in a series of dangerous missions and heists, all while dealing with a dangerous group. [list] [*]Franklin with his desire to become something more & make something of himself which now he become a successful entrepreneur & multi-millionaire in GTA Online: The Contract. It's funny to see Franklin & Lamar doing their chit-chat. His best lines is always, [b]""[i]What?[/i]""[/b]  [*]Michael is a successfully retired & wealthy criminal that wanted to live a peaceful life with his family in Los Santos but slowly turns into a living nightmare. His best lines, [b]""[i]You forget a thousand things every day, pal. Make sure this is one of 'em.[/i]""[/b]  [*]Trevor. I don't know what to say but he's the fucking aggressive one. But I gotta say, he's very loyal & respects all those close to him. Trevor's first introduction include Johnny from GTA IV: TLAD and the moment where Johnny is beaten up till dead by Trevor. One of Trevor's best and funniest lines for me is when he is with Michael and tells him that he kidnapped Madrazo's wife, [b]""[i]What kind of fucking animal do you take me for? No, I didn't kill him. But I did kidnap his wife.[/i]""[/b] [/list] GTA IV also had 3 protagonists, but they were separated yet had one connected plot, while GTA V all in one standalone game and what's new is each protagonist has their own colours.   It's cool that GTA V has many awesome features. The main story now has playable heist missions, convertible cars can retract and deploy their top covers, weapons remain in the inventory after player died or busted, all the weapons are stored in inventory instead of replacing them, random events appeared randomly throughout San Andreas, and 3 protagonists in the same mission allowing you to switch characters during the mission.  Above all, giving me a Grade-A experience, a place with many activities, Online mode to have fun with friends and is still getting new content to this day (this year is Chop Shop), and [spoiler]it gives you patient report after finishing the story.[/spoiler]",True

"The story/singleplayer mode is one of the best games in the genre and while it's difficult to mod there are some fun mods like LSPD for singleplayer that let you play as cops or SWAT.    The official online gets a lot of hate but honestly it's not that bad these days. I only learned this when I started playing again recently, but last year they made some major changes that have reduced the frequency of griefers in public lobbies, as well as made some MASSIVE changes to the grind. You can now run just about any mission and heist prep on a private lobby, meaning you are effectively 100% safe from cheaters or random griefers when running these missions. This has effectively nullified most of the grinding as the only thing preventing you from farming gun running missions before was griefers, and you can easily get millions in a day for doing practically nothing through gun running missions, uninterrupted by players trying to kill you with jets.",True

"I have loved every GTA game; I bought it on release for PS1, GTA3, Vice, San Andreas on PS2.  Single player is excellent and worth buying if you haven't already experienced it.  However, GTA online for PC is absolutey f*cked and a fentanol-filled dumpster fire rolling down Vinewood Hills.  So much so that R* has already abandoned GTA6 2 years before its release on PC.  If you're buying GTA5 online then its probably so you can play it modded anyway or want to RP.   ""If you're not cheatin', you're not tryin'."" -Eddie Guerrero.

"[h1]I'm not a criminal, I'm a entrepreneur[/h1] [i]See you in GTA 6, if i'm alive then...[/i]  Grand Theft Auto V, the latest instalment in the controversial yet wildly popular franchise, delivers just that. First released in 2013, the game has since been remastered and optimised for PC, offering players a chance to experience this sprawling crime epic in stunning 4K resolution and 60fps.   Set in the fictional city of Los Santos, GTA 5 provides a vivid recreation of Southern California and all the seedy underbelly it encapsulates. The game offers a scathing and satirical take on the American Dream through its interweaving story of three criminals from very different walks of life.  [h2]Storyline[/h2] As you progress through the game, you are confronted with moral dilemmas and complex relationships in a world filled with crime, corruption, and the constant pursuit of power.  What sets GTA 5 apart is its unparalleled attention to detail and the sheer scope of its open-world environment. Los Santos evokes the feeling that it is a living, breathing city bustling with pedestrians, traffic, and countless activities to engage in. You could participate in street races, play a round of golf, enjoy a bike ride along the coastline, or visit a strip club.  GTA 5's story mode is a mammoth task, with any one of the characters - Michael, Franklin, or Trevor - providing enough narrative for an entire game. Combined, they offer an intricate plotline with the highest standard of writing. Once introduced, you can freely switch between these characters, each with personality traits and strengths.  Franklin, a streetwise hustler with a good heart, can drive in slow motion. Michael, in witness protection, tries to leave his criminal past behind. Trevor is an unpredictable and volatile character who thrives on chaos.  [h2]Gameplay[/h2] players can engage in various forms of gameplay, such as completing missions, participating in heists, and exploring the open world.  [h3]Shooting Mechanics[/h3] While the base shooting mechanics have held up reasonably well since 2013, there are now third-person cover shooters that feel more fluid. However, GTA 5's shooting is still immensely enjoyable.  [h3]Missions[/h3] With multiple approaches to complete objectives, you can tailor missions to your preferred playstyle. Whether employing stealth, direct confrontation, or strategic planning, the diversity of options ensures that gameplay never feels repetitive or monotonous.  The variety of missions and mechanics guarantees that players remain engaged and excited. You may enact a meticulously planned heist, engage in intense gang warfare, or embark on an adrenaline-fueled chase sequence.  [h3]Customisation[/h3] Players can shape unique experiences by changing outfits, customising vehicles, or exploring the open-world environment. The plethora of choices for players adds replayability even after completing the main story.  [h3]Open World[/h3] Players are granted almost total freedom to explore the vast metropolis of Los Santos and the surrounding countryside.  Driving through the city evokes a palpable sense of place, with responsive vehicle handling and collision physics creating an authentic experience, whether navigating dense traffic in a sports car or off-roading in a 4x4. Piloting aircraft opens up new vistas, from scenic coastal flights to heart-pounding aerial stunts. The open waters surrounding the city are equally inviting to explore by boat or submarine.  An astonishing array of side activities are scattered worldwide, from recreational pursuits like golf, tennis, and cycling to more illicit diversions. Stranger encounters introduce memorably eccentric characters and side missions with compelling self-contained stories. Collectibles like letter scraps and spaceship parts encourage exploration while revealing more about the world and characters, but no one knows this.  [h3]Driving Mechanics[/h3] The driving mechanics of GTA 5 are unrivalled, and constantly comparing other open-world driving games to GTA games like Just Cause, Watch_Dogs and Saints Row, just to name a few, doesn't even come close to the pure satisfaction I get from the multitude of vehicles I have at my disposal and how vastly differing they all feel to navigate through the streets of Los Santos.  [h2]Stunning Visuals for 2013[/h2] Everything from the character models to the buildings and terrain is meticulously detailed3. The lighting and particle effects are also remarkably realistic, showcasing beautiful sunrises and sunsets and how dust kicks up from off-road driving. These visuals, combined with the seamless transition between the city and the open countryside, make exploring the world a visually arresting experience.  [h3]Cinematic Soundtrack[/h3] The original score for GTA 5 was composed to create tension during action sequences and a sense of ambience while free roaming or completing mundane tasks. The game also features licensed music spread across 15 radio stations, including hip-hop, rock, and country genres. Players can simply cruise down the freeway and enjoy the scenery while listening to their favourite tunes.  [h2]Online[/h2] After nearly a decade on the market, GTA 5 Online remains a polarising experience. For all its ambition and scale, the game struggles to balance engaging open-world gameplay with an incentive structure that pushes players toward griefing and other toxic behaviour. Though recent updates have aimed to curb the worst excesses of the community, the problems run deeper in the very framework of how GTA 5 Online functions.   If you can find a group of like-minded players, there are glimpses of the promised fun and hijinks. But for most, GTA 5 Online is a cautionary tale of how even the most sprawling virtual worlds can feel empty when not built with community in mind. You may enter with an open mind, ready for adventure, but leave with a sobering reminder of the darker impulses that emerge when there are no consequences. For a game that holds up a mirror to society, it's a reflection we may not wish to see.  [h2]Conclusion[/h2] Overall, Grand Theft Auto V is an impressively ambitious and complex game that pushes the envelope of open-world gaming and storytelling. The massive scope of its gameplay and intricate story should satisfy even the most hardcore GTA fans. While not without its flaws and controversies, GTA V is a technical and creative marvel that provides hours of entertainment and escapism.   Suppose you want to immerse yourself in a satirical take on modern culture with engaging characters and non-stop action. In that case, you'll find it hard to beat this sprawling crime epic. With so much to see and do in the world of Los Santos, GTA V stands out as one of the most compelling open-world experiences in gaming.",True

"Game requires admin rights.  Launcher requires admin rights.  Game requires Steam to run with admin rights.

This game is really amazing the story is pretty good. Although I did accidentally corrupt my save file :( GTA Online is really good when you aren't getting hunted by high level players. I have made friends with people who do private lobbies with me to host high paying robberies so I can get cool cars. The one thing I have to complain about is the modders I ran into one and he said wanna see something cool so I said yea and he made me go from level 10 to level 105. I do admit it was my fault. It really messed me up because I had so little money for such a high level. Besides that I think the game is good.,True

"I've been playing this game for about 2-3 years a majority of the time i play this game i have to play in friends only lobbies My experiences consist of getting locked out of my online account, locked out of gta v for 3 days couldnt even play story mode, spawn trapped in passive mode, prevented from leaving the game and closing the window because of spawn camping, lagged out of the game, my internet taken offline, falsely reported because modders and hackers got mad at me, locked out of all of my cars, even the cars in my garage and businesses, being constantly targeted for some reason even while hopping lobbies to get away, i get ddos'd and booted offline for killing a modder with a 1000$ bounty, crashed for going after their bounty, locked in a cage while in passive and set on fire and cant escape even in death, prevented from switching lobbies to escape them while they keep spawn camping me, i could drive around do nothing and still get kicked off the game, even playing in story mode ill get kicked out of the game and another thing making money in friends only lobbies only for it not to save due to ""connection issues"" and when i try to in a public session i just get targeted and lose all my money anyway so whats the point. All of these experiences are from dealing with modders and hackers in the game. slowly day by day its becoming less enjoyable for me to keep playing.

"Grand Theft Auto V: A Tale of Two Realities – A Stellar Campaign Overshadowed by Online Chaos  My experience with Grand Theft Auto V has been a rollercoaster of emotions, swinging between awe and frustration. While the single-player campaign is undeniably cool and engaging, the online portion of the game has left a bitter taste in my mouth due to the rampant hacking issues that plague the experience.  Let's start with the positive aspect: the campaign. Rockstar Games has crafted a narrative masterpiece with an engaging storyline, diverse characters, and a sprawling open-world that begs to be explored. The single-player experience is a testament to the studio's prowess in storytelling and game design, providing players with a captivating journey through the criminal underworld of Los Santos.  However, the real allure of Grand Theft Auto V lies in its online mode. It's a shame that Rockstar Games seems to turn a blind eye to the overwhelming hack scene that has infested the online realm. Hackers run rampant, and their presence transforms what should be a thrilling multiplayer experience into a chaotic and frustrating mess. From money hacks to invincibility cheats, the online portion of the game feels like a lawless Wild West where legitimate players are left to fend for themselves against the onslaught of malicious exploits.  The sad truth is that Rockstar Games, despite their immense resources and player community feedback, has not done enough to rein in the hack scene across all their games. This negligence not only undermines the integrity of the online experience in Grand Theft Auto V but also casts a shadow over the multiplayer aspects of their other titles. It's disheartening to see a company of such stature failing to address a persistent issue that has been affecting their player base for far too long.  As much as the campaign showcases Rockstar's brilliance, the allure of the online world is where the real fun is at. The fact that this experience is marred by the unchecked proliferation of hackers is a major letdown. Until Rockstar Games takes decisive action to curb the hack scene and create a more secure online environment, Grand Theft Auto V's online mode will remain a frustrating and unfulfilling playground for those seeking genuine multiplayer enjoyment.",False

this game has been out for ages and ive probably sunk thousands of hours between xbox 360 and pc. the game has gotten progressively worse with each update. the game used to be simple heists and gangbangs and now its become a game where the grind to get money has basically turned into a 9 to 5 job. it went from lets do a heist or lets rob this gang to well looks like i need to resupply my bunker so i can sell it for money i can use to upgrade my bunker so it can produce more stuff to sell from each supply run. the game has fallen from grace and with the recent deletion of some of the most iconic cars ive finally had enough. hopefully they make the next installment worth my time and money but i fear this series is over.,False

"Definitely a must play, since I was a kid playing GTA III, Vice city and San Andreas was the only way of experiencing some sort of reality in games along with the feeling you can do whatever you want.  Story 10/10 - the back and forth between Michael and Trevor with a side of Franklin with the San Andreas vibe is awesome Gameplay - 8/10 - would like a bit more challenge with the shooting mechanics Graphics - 10/10 - for a 10 year old game, it looks stunning.

"-Playing this game was like having a conversation with a brick wall—tedious, unresponsive, and it left me feeling pretty solidly unimpressed. The storyline? I'd have had more emotional investment watching paint dry. And don't get me started on the characters. They were about as memorable as yesterday's news. -I've seen more intuitive gameplay in a game of blindfolded tag with a group of cats. And bugs? Oh boy, it's a bug buffet! Glitches everywhere, like the game was sponsored by a tech-savvy insect population. -In summary, this game is a bit like the Titanic—lots of hype, but ultimately it left me feeling like I was sinking into a sea of disappointment. Save your money, buy a plant, at least they respond when you water them.""",False

I'm so impressed with the story line and the game play that I've barely been able to appreciate the hard work and talent expressed by the graphics(which are otherworldly when compared to Metroid, Shinobi, Contra, etc.  In short, I cracked open a door and baby-stepped back into an awesome world that all started with GTA V.

"Gameplay - 8/10 Whilst some people may dislike the Rockstar gameplay formula as it certainly isn't for everyone, I like it and it has made me come back to the story missions of this game about 3 times across all the platforms that I have played it on now. The gun play in this game is satisfying for me as the guns really feel like they have power behind them. Driving mechanics are fun and easy.  Story - 6/10 I wasn't too interested for most of the story and, whilst there were some cool mission based around the story and some funny moments in the cut scenes, it was mainly the gameplay that kept me playing.  Graphics - 7/10 The graphics of this game still hold up quite well today and I'm sure they will for a while. There are little details in some models that make the game world feel real and like there are many moving parts to each object. Explosion and fire effects still look good and are satisfying to watch.  Performance - 9/10 I had some performance issues when I first started playing this game on PC but I have put that down to driver issues as they have disappeared since.  Online - 6/10 Personally, the online never really interested me much but I think that it is mainly down to the fact that I don't have a group of friends that I can play it with to properly get into it and that would keep me coming back. There is plenty to do in the online for people who like that sort of stuff though. I just personally prefer single player games.  Overall - 9/10 If you haven't played this game yet then I would recommend that you do so before GTA 6 releases within the next 583.29 years.",True

"A Modern Gaming Masterpiece: GTA V Review Rating: ★★★★★ After investing a staggering 793 hours into Grand Theft Auto V, I can confidently say that it is an absolute gaming masterpiece. Rockstar Games has once again delivered an unparalleled open-world experience that surpasses all expectations. The level of detail in Los Santos is mind-blowing. Every street corner, building, and NPC feels alive and vibrant, creating an immersive environment that constantly begs to be explored. The attention to detail is remarkable, showcasing a level of craftsmanship seldom seen in gaming. The storyline is gripping, filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat. Each character has a distinct personality, and their intertwining narratives provide a deep and engaging experience that is both humorous and emotionally charged. The gameplay, too, is exceptional. The controls are smooth and intuitive, allowing for seamless transitions between driving, shooting, and participating in various activities. From high-speed police chases to intense heists and exhilarating stunt jumps, there is always something to do and a sense of freedom that is unparalleled. GTA V boasts an expansive multiplayer mode that further amplifies the game's longevity. Whether it's joining a crew and engaging in epic battles or simply exploring the vast open world with friends, the multiplayer component provides endless hours of entertainment and camaraderie. Furthermore, the constant updates and DLCs released by Rockstar Games have kept the game fresh and exciting. From new vehicles and weapons to challenging missions and events, the developers' commitment to the game's ongoing support is commendable. However, it's worth mentioning that the game does contain mature content and violence, which may not be suitable for all audiences. While it successfully explores darker themes, it's important for players to approach it with maturity and awareness. All in all, Grand Theft Auto V is an exceptional game that has undoubtedly become a cultural phenomenon. With its stunning visuals, captivating narrative, and an expansive open world that begs to be explored, it is a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. Despite the countless hours invested, the game continues to surprise and captivate me, making it a definite contender for the title of the greatest game of all time. I cannot recommend GTA V enough. Whether you're a fan of the series or new to the world of GTA, this game is a true masterpiece that should not be missed. Happy gaming! Note: The rating and review are based on personal experience and may differ from individual to individual.",True

"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients:  1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie  Directions:  1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",True

"NB: I haven't been a fan of the series (though I enjoyed RDR2 a lot), so if you are or want to try it out, maybe this review isn't for you. Also, as I understand, the overwhelming majority of people now buy it for Online, which I also don't care about, this is about the single-player mode.  So, I've played quite a few huge sandbox games. I've even 100% (or close to 100%) completed quite a few. Why does GTA V not work for me in that regard?  Well, really, the answer is quite simple: despite being a huge open world with many, many activities you [b]could[/b] do, I don't particularly care to actually do any of them. It is honestly quite baffling as to how much work the game developers have put into things that just seem... completely out of place and pointless. You can do parachute jumps! You can play tennis! You can do plane stunts! You can do a triathlon! You can buy property! You can participate in car races! You can do yoga! You can play golf! You can buy and sell stock on the stock market! You can use your inconvenient phone camera which makes you stand completely still while you use it to take pictures of wildlife that kills you in one hit!  But is that really why I'd play a Grand Theft Auto game?  Sure, there are still the main missions, and a few side ones, but completing ALL of them took me less than 40 hours, and that included some messing around, which is quite a feat for a large sandbox.  But here's the thing: I didn't [b]actually[/b] complete all of the side missions. Why? Well, because I have no way to know how to do that.  One issue is that some side missions seem to be locked behind buying particular properties, which is not only completely not-obvious (especially since not all of them do that), but also requires you to either finish the game (to get any money to spare), or abuse the stock market system, which, due to its own quirks, can be quite hard to do without a guide. Others are ""random"", as in, while they have specific points where they can trigger, you wouldn't know what these points are (without a guide), and they might [b]not[/b] trigger there even if you're nearby purely by chance. Yet others require even more obscure ways of starting them.  Lastly, there are several collect-a-thon missions in the game, but, seriously, screw them. No markers, no clues, no nothing. Apparently, one of the protagonist trio can use his dog to search for [b]some[/b] of the collectibles, but the game never explained it or that it's even possible, so good luck figuring that without a guide. And even then, you'd need to run around the huge map to do this.  It's a good thing that I didn't even try to get 100%, though, because, apparently, one of the completion marks requires the use of a separate mobile app... which has been, at this point, removed from stores. Womp-womp.  Gameplay-wise, GTA V feels smoother than GTA IV, though that's not saying much. The flight controls are as horrendous as ever, going for completely misplaced realism. The police are cheating bastards who know what your location is at any point in time, can spawn out of thin air, and have cars that rubberband to you no matter what, making upgrading cars for speed pretty much pointless. Your health regenerates only up to half, and there are rarely any health pick ups (and no armor pick ups), forcing you to stay in cover most of the time in a shootout.  The story is not very gripping either, mostly concerning not particularly likable people doing things for extremely petty reasons. The best part of the game are heist missions, purely because of how you get to choose how they go, even if in reality there aren't that many ways your choices affect them, bar the one major one on the selected approach method. Unfortunately, there are only a few of those throughout the entire game, and I honestly don't know why else would I recommend it.",False
"Great game especially with friends. The graphics are really good and the game is very well optimized as well (even an entry level computer of today could run it well). There are also lots of things to do in this game. Stuff like messing around, missions, heists, mini games, story mode, etc. Like seriously, theres an insane amount of stuff to do. The game has so much play value.   What I like most in the game was the heists, the challenging content of the game (doomsday heist), playing with friends, collecting cars and weapons, messing around, and the environment.   The game is worth every penny, I highly recommend it!",True

"Very optimized port of the game. Unfortunately can't play the game fully offline because of Rockstar Games Launcher DRM, which is a downside.

Everytime I use it, the launcher always finds a way for me not to play GTA V and other Rockstar games. Just recently I've ran into an issue involving the activation of my CD key through the RSG. This won't even let me play the game because they want to completely ignore Steam's DRM and security for games in favor of their own proprietary security measures. This ultimately harms the experience of the players in the name of money. Therefor, I cannot recommend this game at all.",False

"This is the first GTA I've ever played, and probably the only  one I ever will.  Not because I didn't like it, but because I absolutely fell in love with it, and I genuinely don't think there's any topping this game -I guess we'll see with GTA6!   This is obviously a labour of love, and as someone who also loved both RDR games, I was still blown away by the quality in this game. The characters and actors are amazing, and the story is that perfect blend between comedy, drama and parody.   I have an issue with some of Rockstar's janky mechanics in some places- and some side quest are more infuriating than fun, but that's not exclusive to this game; it's just  Rockstar thing xD  Very very very good game, great quality and detail.",True

"It always needed more story line content, I've never liked the online part of this game it's just not for me and it is full of A-holes that just want to ruin your game and unless you have lots of user stats no one will join your missions, but I love the story I must have restated it twenty or so times over the last ten years. I am looking forward to America today Oh I mean GTA6 but I hope it stacks up to 5 and engages the world not just more Go America number one crap because guess what you ain't even in the top ten.",True

Like wtf dude and oh I can't unlink my steam either because you want me to verify the email on the account? Understandable except I DONT OWN THE FUCKING EMAIL ON THE ACCOUNT, SOME RUSSIAN HACKER DOES YOU IDIOTS. God damn. Please PLEASE do not buy this game until they figure out their shitty ass service.   Also the cherry on top of this is even if I WANTED to buy more Rockstar games (which I will not do anymore) I can't because the email being linked to my steam prevents this specific steam account from playing on any other god damn account.

"I kept playing to see why so many people love the online side of this game and I eventually came to the realisation that it is just a bit shi.t and people must be complete morons to actually enjoy it.  Like it's GTA, it was fun to go back to something I've not played in nearly ten years, it's nice to revisit the map and having some new characters, campaigns, vehicles and things to do but that's it. The game has not improved, combat and character movement is still awful, driving gets boring quickly and all the new jobs, missions, heists and vehicles feel tacked on, nothing actually feels new or very interesting.  The worst thing is the actual online side, everyone is there just to prevent regular players attempting missions or trying to start missions. I understand people messing about with new vehicles they've bought but it's just so lame that that's what some people do every night of their lives, it's almost as douche as buying hacks or even worse buying in game money from Rockstar. My worst personal experience was a multiplayer mission where at the end everyone was spawned together so one players killed everyone else and stole everyone's money. Good Game design.   You can get away from all the other online players by selecting a new session and invite only, but this only really helps if you want to play solo. My main interest in the game was to play coop with a buddy, it's doable but it's a total ball ache as you will spend almost half your time in loading screens, you can't just play together as you constantly have to invite the other player to do something and if you finish a mission together then you are both put back into separate lobbies.  I wish I hadn't bothered with the online, the only thing that it's taught me is that Rockstar seriously needs to pull some magic off for GTA6 to be good, I'm sure it's going to look incredible and be an insanely detailed world, just like RDR2, but they need to reassess their gameplay unless the only people they are catering for are twelve year old boys with ADHD.",False
"1 out of 10 gameplay experience.    So I decided to finally try a GTA game, and this PoS wouldn't work 20 min in.  It crapped out on a loading screen.  It turns out that this has been a problem since 2015.  It's almost 2024 now.  Well, definitely not getting the sequel on the consoles considering they can't fix an issue that's 9 years old.  I'll keep trying to play through the game and if the problem manages to get resolved then I'll change my review.",False

It's not Pulitzer material, but it's like that B-movie you secretly love. Unlocked every achievement after countless hours, so you can trust my expertise.

Granted, I can't stand hearing some Randy naggerguy poppn off the n-bomb every other 2 words, but for some reason that how some people communicate IRL; when this happen IRL too I do the same thing as in game, IGNORE/MUTE, but lets not talk about the blatant hypocrisy of what is going on while playing this game like stealing, boofiing drugs, banging prostitutes, and murdering NPC's like it ""No Russian"". What people liked about GTA is freedom, and looks like Rockstar is caving to the tiniest population in history ever recorded of all sorts of rando alphabets that whine and cry to get their way with products and services that aren't even theirs, vs actually making something (new game IP)  or improving an an existing product (MOD), you know like how capitalism works.... play if you want, but don't be buying shark cards to promote this anti-american anti-game anti-freedom BS that they have implemented.",False

"Because of Rockstar's over-restrictive DRM, I am unable to play a singleplayer game I paid money for.  To be able to play the game at all (even ""offline"" play), you need to sign into a Rockstar Social Club account.   Having first launched the game years ago I used a Rockstar account I no longer have access to. No big deal I thought, I'd just make a new one and sign in.  Nope. You are not allowed to use a different Rockstar account than the one you first used with the Steam account. I opened a support ticket with Rockstar and they told me tough cookies.   So I am unable to play a game I own, despite having bought it on this very Steam account. Never buy from Rockstar I suppose.",False

"If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Brawnys recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients:  1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter 2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 4 large eggs 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (optional) 1 cup chopped nuts (optional) Instructions:  Preheat Oven: 1. Preheat your oven to 175°C. Grease the baking pan or line it with parchment paper. 2. In a medium-sized saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Remove from heat once melted. 3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. 4. Add the melted butter to the dry ingredients and stir until well combined. 5. Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next one. Stir in the vanilla extract. 6. If desired, fold in chocolate chips and chopped nuts to add extra texture and flavor. 7. Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (not wet batter). 8. Allow the brownies to cool in the pan for about 10-15 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before cutting. 9. Once the brownies are completely cooled, cut them into squares or rectangles. Enjoy!  Feel free to customize this recipe to suit your preferences. You can add ingredients like caramel swirls, different types of nuts, or even a sprinkle of sea salt on top for an extra special touch. Enjoy your delicious homemade brownies!",True

"""Grand Theft Auto V"" (GTA V), developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, stands as a magnum opus in the gaming industry, redefining open-world experiences and narrative-driven gameplay. Originally released in 2013 and continually updated, GTA V remains an enduring masterpiece that seamlessly blends a vast, immersive world with compelling storytelling, unparalleled attention to detail, and a plethora of activities that captivate players for hours on end.  The visual spectacle of Los Santos, the game's fictional representation of Los Angeles, is nothing short of breathtaking. The meticulously crafted cityscape, diverse landscapes, and dynamic weather effects contribute to an ever-evolving and living environment. Character animations, facial expressions, and the sheer scale of the game world showcase Rockstar's commitment to pushing the boundaries of gaming visuals.  At the narrative core of GTA V are three protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—each with a unique personality, background, and skill set. The intersecting storylines provide a rich and multifaceted narrative that explores themes of crime, ambition, and the pursuit of the American Dream. The character development is masterful, creating a compelling emotional connection with each protagonist, even as players navigate the morally ambiguous world they inhabit.  The open-world design of GTA V is a triumph in player freedom. The sprawling city and surrounding areas offer an abundance of activities, from high-stakes heists and adrenaline-fueled car chases to more leisurely pursuits like golf and yoga. The attention to detail extends to the dynamic ecosystem of the city, with pedestrians going about their lives, engaging in conversations, and reacting realistically to the player's actions.  The game's driving and combat mechanics are refined and responsive, offering a satisfying blend of realism and accessibility. The vast array of vehicles, weapons, and customization options provides players with the tools to approach missions and free-roaming in their unique style.  GTA Online, the multiplayer component of the game, further expands the experience. It allows players to engage in various cooperative and competitive activities, build criminal enterprises, and explore Los Santos with friends. The ongoing support from Rockstar with regular updates, new content, and events ensures that the online experience remains dynamic and engaging.  The soundtrack of GTA V deserves special mention, featuring an eclectic mix of genres and a curated radio station lineup that adds depth to the game's atmosphere. The voice acting, led by stellar performances from the main cast, enhances the overall cinematic quality of the experience.  While the game has received criticism for its mature content and occasionally controversial themes, it undeniably represents a pinnacle in interactive storytelling, offering players an unprecedented level of agency in a virtual world.  In conclusion, ""Grand Theft Auto V"" stands as a titan in the gaming industry, seamlessly blending an expansive open-world environment with a gripping narrative, exceptional character development, and an array of activities that keep players enthralled. Its enduring popularity and ongoing relevance speak to its status as a benchmark for what a video game can achieve. GTA V is not just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon that continues to shape the landscape of interactive entertainment.",True

"The Devs for this game are ridiculous. They make the online part of this game so grindy so if a mod comes and gives you a ridiculous amount of money or you use something to give yourself money so that you can actually make some money or use it to just have fun and buy vehicles they suspend your account. To all the Devs, get a life and let people have fun who aren't harming other players. Go suspend the accounts of people who are actual causing issues in online games like using GOD MODE or TP to people and killing them over and over or the people joining games and being invisible to kill you or having unlimited ammo and not needing to reload or explosive bullets. I have gotten into so many lobbies on PC and Xbox and have been messed with more of those people then someone giving money or modding to give money. Also how i know the Devs aren't doing squat about greifers is because i found two the other day and they have been doing this for months now.

"Title: A Decade-Long Journey through Los Santos: GTA V's Lasting Impact  Grand Theft Auto V, a virtual playground that has been a cornerstone of my gaming existence since I first stepped into the sun-soaked streets of Los Santos at the age of 12, continues to be a defining and integral part of my gaming life. As I reflect on an immersive 11-year journey, it's clear that GTA V isn't merely a game; it's a dynamic and enduring chapter in the story of my digital adventures.  Released in 2013, GTA V's Los Santos immediately captivated me with its breathtaking scale and attention to detail. The city was a living, breathing entity, teeming with diverse neighborhoods, iconic landmarks, and a vast, open landscape that begged to be explored. From the sunsets over Mount Chiliad to the vibrant lights of the Vinewood strip, each corner of the map became a familiar, yet endlessly captivating, part of my virtual world.  The narrative brilliance, which has become a trademark of the Grand Theft Auto series, found new heights in GTA V. The trio of protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor – brought unique perspectives to a sprawling tale of crime, camaraderie, and the pursuit of the American Dream. The heist missions, a standout feature, were not just adrenaline-pumping escapades but also strategic challenges that required meticulous planning and execution.  GTA V's success didn't stop at its single-player narrative; the introduction of Grand Theft Auto Online (GTAO) added an entirely new dimension to the experience. For the past six years, my friends and I have embarked on countless adventures in Los Santos, from coordinated heists to wild races and impromptu free-roam shenanigans. The ever-expanding world of GTA Online, with its regular updates and new content, has kept the virtual landscape fresh and dynamic.  The game's attention to detail extends beyond the narrative and into its satirical take on modern society. The radio stations, television shows, and in-game internet provided a sharp commentary on everything from politics to pop culture, enhancing the game's immersion and creating a world that felt eerily reflective of our own.  The gameplay mechanics, refined over the years, offered a perfect blend of action, exploration, and a sandbox for creativity. The character-switching feature, improved driving physics, and an extensive range of activities ensured that Los Santos never felt stale, even after countless hours of play.  While GTA V garnered widespread acclaim, it wasn't without its controversies and critiques, particularly in relation to the microtransaction model in GTA Online. Yet, these issues did little to diminish the overall impact of a game that has been a constant companion throughout my adolescence and early adulthood.  As I reminisce about the countless hours spent in Los Santos, the friendships forged in chaotic online sessions, and the enduring allure of the game's open world, it's clear that GTA V is more than just a form of entertainment. It's a nostalgic time capsule, a digital diary chronicling my growth as a gamer and the evolving landscape of the gaming industry over the past 11 years.  In the grand tapestry of my gaming life, GTA V stands tall as a masterpiece that transcends the medium. It's not just a game; it's a virtual home, a canvas for endless adventures, and a testament to the lasting impact that video games can have on the fabric of our lives.",True

I try a third time, and thankfully it works. I get into a lobby and can't become a CEO because the maximum limit has been reached so I'm unable to start a business or do a cayo perico heist. I go outside in my favorite car. I'm killed by a random flying by on an oppressor. I call Mors mutual, get my car back. An orbital strike kills me. I call Mors mutual, a piloted missile from a sub kills me from a mile away. I call mors mutual, pissed off I am now looking to pvp. I pull up to someone and try shooting them. They're invincible. They launch my car into the stratosphere with cheats. I give up on freeplay. I try to load the Cayo Perico finale. I get stuck on the loading screen 4 times in a row and I end up unable to play the heist today.

Single player is a lot of fun and enjoyable. lots of twists and gun fights. its worth it. online, however... can be hit or miss. lots of cheaters online but sometimes its playable. so invest in the single player and play online with friends or on your own.   havent tried it yet, but plan to mod the game and see how that goes.",True

"PC version still doesn't have the graphical update that consoles had for over a year now, and with the recent update, now doesn't have ANIMALS [without mentioning third-party software modifications] where console does. Don't waste your time or money, PC version is an afterthought to Rockstar. This is without me going into the new player experience to Grand Theft Auto Online where you're already severely handicapped by not having properties to launch most of the content that is currently out like Cayo Perico or base heists like Pacific Standard unless you find a group of friends who already have said resources or pay money to get ingame cash to buy said properties.  SP is fun, though, I will say, but also suffers from a lack of attention, where Online has several more vehicles and weapons that the base game doesn't, with no way to be able to use them without third party tools. Honestly just wait for GTAVI at this point, God knows whenever that will be for PC.",False

"""How to describe the heavy snow""My teacher said so.  That was eight or nine years ago.I was still in primary school at that time.The first thing I do after school every day is to turn on the computer and watch the program.By chance, I met GTA5.He really gave me a great shock in my childhood, and then I realized that the original game could do this.Since then, I have been tirelessly watching related videos every day to see how the anchors are all-powerful in Los Angeles.Then I reluctantly turned off the TV when my parents urged me to eat.It was a wonderful time.It formed my whole childhood concept of games.Until this year, I finally played this game and walked on the streets of Los Angeles. Everything was familiar and vivid.I have traveled to this hometown through video countless times.I finished the offline story again, no, I don't know how many times I relived their story, but this time I witnessed it myself.After many years, it still gave me a shock, about the stories of the protagonists, about my second hometown, Los Angeles.Driving in the street car in Los Angeles, playing Sleeping Walk.My childhood has drifted away, but it won't, forever the capital of Los Angeles, a generation of classics.After many years, I remember when the teacher asked me how to describe the heavy snow, and now I have the answer.

"Simply the best game in the entire series, and holds up nearly a decade after its release. I have no idea why I never got around to playing this sooner, but I'm glad I finally did. Every main character is likable and hilarious in their own way; even the d@mn dog, Chop, had me at hello.  Don't worry about how messy the online experience is. This is not a game you should be playing for the PVP. This very busy slice of San Andreas is more than detailed and vivid enough to keep you busy for a very long time. I've never met a GTA game that wasn't worth booting up just to go for a cruise and get absolutely nothing done and still feel like a satisfying time was had. Five does this best - I daresay better than my previous favorite entry in the franchise, Vice City. There is plenty to keep you busy until 6 comes out in a few years - and no doubt, that announcement is gonna drive a lot of people, even a whole new generation of  gamers, back here to 5 while they wait with baited breath. At the prices it usually goes on sale for - $10-15 - it's still money well spent. There's no better way to get your fix until the next installment hits.  There's a lot of wasted time still in my future with this game, I have foreseen it.",True

"Online is pretty terrible :( Ruined by modders because Rockstar cant seem to figure out how anti-cheat works.  Bugs, glitches and long loading times on some occasions. Some content is fairly repetitive and not very enjoyable. Half the cars have been taken away and resold exclusively to console players after purchasing the game. GTA+ is a scam. The game is poorly optimized and will run at low fps while GPU usage stays low.  Inflation on nearly everything which means you have to replay the same boring heist a hundred times to actually afford anything decent. Overall the game has become the parody in which it once used to make fun of which is quite sad when you think about it. A shame as the game has alot of potential. If they fail so much and cant get the online in GTA 5 to work properly then I dont have much excitement for GTA 6. There are much better developed games out there that id rather spend my time playing. Sorry Rockstar but Online is a mess. The players deserve a refund. Absolute Garbage.",False

"Honestly I love this game. I have played it on many accounts in the past. The reason I wouldn't recommend this game to other people is because GTA Online is overrun by people with virtual powers to freeze your game. So lets say you see an easy kill inside a store or you want to run over a group of people fighting, it really doesnt matter the scenario - you can bet one out of the many players, who may or may not be there, has a tool on his machine which can log your IP (which honestly doesnt do anything - especially with a VPN), and they can do things like freeze your character, spawn hundreds of vehicles on top of you, and even edit your stats and money in-game. The bottom line is this: people in GTA Online are emotionally challenged. They get angry too easily and when you anger the wrong person they unleash glitches from the nether onto your GTA character faster than you can blink. This will disrupt your gameplay and might even frustrate the sh*taki out of you, but if you show them they got to you then they've won. So I do not recommend this game for anyone who is an emotional basketcase. Rockstar and Steam really ought to start making gamers take psychological tests before selling them games like this. The entire GTA Online community is toxic when it comes to in-game mechanics and dealing with getting your character hurt. I mean that is the point of the game, but they take it so seriously that they react like you've just taken a leak in their cheerios.",False

"I wanted to hit recommend because both single-player and online have some great moments and I do think it's worth playing (maybe on sale though), BUT (and this is a BIG but) there are just WAY too many cheaters with mod-menus that grief you and are invincible. Like I get that Online is SUPER grindy to get to the good stuff, and I totally understand people using these cheat menus to give themselves ranks and or cash (Who actually buys Shark Cards? lol), but there is absolutely no reason to take out a low rank level 10 doing a job when you are an invincible rank level 420+ cheating with a mod menu. Too many hacking griefers in this game that Rockstar doesn't ban. So I just can't recommend currently.  It's good. (When it isn't grindy and you aren't being griefed by modmenu cheaters)",False

"This game has been around for almost a decade. It gets a lot of love that is well deserved and its even better on PC then it was on console when I originally played it at launch. I don't think I need to elaborate on the story or the game mechanics, it is your typical GTA style open world sandbox affair and no one in the business does it better then Rockstar Games. It'll be interesting to see if their next release is as interesting seeing as this style of game has started to feel stale, at least that's how I felt about RDR2. I know that people loved that title, however, it was a little bit drawn out for my tastes. I will be replaying that one too just to give it another shake a few years later. I can't say that this is a bad game, and tbh, it is my second fav in the franchise behind Vice City.",True

"Today, I want to introduce you to a highly anticipated game, Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). The game is an action-adventure game developed by Rockstar Games and first released in 2013.  First, let's talk about the graphics of the game. Grand Theft Auto V uses advanced graphics technology to make the scenes and characters in the game very realistic. Whether it is the architecture of the city, the natural scenery or the facial expressions of the characters, every detail is carefully designed to make people feel like they are in it. At the same time, the animation effects of the game are very smooth, making people feel like watching a Hollywood blockbuster.  Next, let's talk about the plot of the game. Grand Theft Auto V takes place in the fictional city of Los Angeles and allows players to take on the roles of three different characters: Mike, Trevor and Franklin. Each of these three characters has its own story arc, and players need to complete missions to advance the story. The whole story is tight, gripping and irresistible.  Finally, let's talk about how the game is played. Grand Theft Auto V is an action adventure game in which players are required to drive, shoot, sneak and more. At the same time, there are a variety of tasks for the player to complete, these tasks not only test the player's operating skills, but also make the game more interesting.  Overall, Grand Theft Auto V is a very good game. Its beautiful picture, compact plot, diverse gameplay, people can not extricate themselves. If you love action adventure games, then this game must not be missed!",True

"Unbelievable how a multi million company can be too limited to either properly program or remove their stupid forced launcher when they think they can make a Steam release. You buy a title from rockstar on steam again so that you can escape this moronic senseless plague called rockstar social garbage and then after a 100GB download you get nothing but crazy error messages, login prompts and when you have made it into the game you are asked for some activation to register the game you bought on steam with rockstar.",False

"TLDR; GTA Online does not feel like GTA and is Pay2Win.  You can buy with real money weapons and super-charged weaponized vehicles. This allows you to dominate all other players. Regular players will never have those if they don't make this game their full-time job for extended period of time.  The super charged weapons and vehicles make this game have zero GTA vibe. I'm trying to blast someone with a shotgun, but they perish me with some alien looking, alien sounding weapon that I do not even know what it is. Laser weapons? What about learn how to make a consistent game experience.  Also, game experiences so many issues when trying to play with friends, I will join a session, but not be with them in a session, or I would get kicked for no reason, etc...  I am not even gonna mention anything about cheaters/modders as it doesn't matter. What's the difference between a cheater one-shoot killing me and a kid who poured ton of money into the game and can chase me around a map in a flying motorbike that's capable of shooting rookets?   GTA? No. This game does not feel like a GTA.",False

"For a 10+ year old game it still manages to impress me. Been playing it (off and on) since it first dropped on PS3 and even now, on PC in the end of 2023, this is still an amazing game. Even with GTA6 on the horizon (at long last) I'd still recommend picking this game up (if somehow you've managed not too) and giving it a go. Sure it has aged quite abit now, there are prettier games out there for sure, but the detail R* put in this game is unreal and the expansive open world is still alot of fun to explore. Online is playable solo if you really not interested in playing with randoms (or don't have friends who play) but is best experienced with others if possible.",True

"Note to myself to stop playing Rockstar games.  I was trying to finish RDR2 recently and I never felt so dumb during that time.  Yes, it is rather beautiful game with nice acting and ugly looking characters, but the worst problem is like when there is a mission there can be shooting and massacre all around and no one cares but on the instant when mission ends, dare to loot a remaining character because dreaded ""15 second attention bubble code"" is instantly spawning a witness on a horse or riding a cart to report Your crime to the authorities.  When You are hunting there will be no animals for hours, but as soon as You are riding a horse they will be spawning because they are acting as a ""decoration"".  These kind of games are like the yarn string that we, people use to entertain the cat - they put something stupid in our sight and we run to catch a that red string.  But is this really what we want and need?  Well may be some, but I do not.  I want to heave meaningful experiences in the open world game where I can feel as a creator myself instead of a dumb idiot chasing random number generator creating spawns to find and catch a three star animal for a crafting blueprint that will add +5 stats on my inventory capacity or something like that.  It's dumb, it's nonsense.  I can't put this review on RDR2 on steam since I bought it on Microsoft Store I believe so I put it here since, according to my own memories - GTAV was pretty much the same kind of design:  Much of the world is persistent only as long as it is within Your cone of view. Like if You watch a traffic in the industrial complex You will see a lot of heavy trailers driving and they stay on road if You follow them further outside that industrial complex, but the very next moment, when You pan Your view to something else, outside their ""spawn area"", they are lost - ""despawned"".  Think of it as if You were trying to play a chess but You are limited to see only the half of the chess board and every time You move Your sight, the chess pieces reappear randomly, to create an illusion of playing a chess game: that is what it means to play these kind of games.",False

"I won't say anything new that wasn't said millions times before. GTA V is a must own and play for almost anyone who enjoys perfect games. You have like literally and open world in which you can do anything, and everything is done so good, so great. I beat this game on PS4, and to be honest the control at the beginning felt awkward, but its just like for 5,6 hours - then you will get use to them and it will be just awesome. And there couple more minuses (story mode) - i didn't find any purpose for your crews skill levels - there aren't many heists in the story itself (or maybe i missed something). And other thing is sometimes very frustrating controls of the characters when you there is action is some very closed space, thankfully there weren't many of those. And the last thing is a targeting system when you are in a car flying on some 120 km/h - good luck in to shooting some specific targets.  That said, GTA 5 is almost perfect. The story narrative, screenplay, acting, voice acting, directing and whole craftsmanship is the best there can be. And i even just started to scratch the surface of GTA Online. Overall - one of the very best ever.",True

"Look at my game time. This is just what I have on PC, not including the last two generations of consoles dating back to launch. This game was good at first but quickly fell into the MTX pit of doom where the entire game is based around leeching as much money as they can from you to fuel overpriced in game content that relies on an absurd amount of game time to achieve. They spent literally zero effort whatsoever on combatting the modding issue and never will fix it; that much is apparent. You will never be able to enter a server with or without friends and actually get anything done without being griefed into another dimension by modders and hackers.  It's a true shame because the core gameplay is good. Unfortunately because of the pricing of items, forced game time, MTX and modders this game isn't worth your time. Again, look at my hours spent. I've been trying to play for the last 2 weeks to just run some basic missions for businesses and get absolutely nowhere. When you get attacked by god mode modders and can't even rely on skill to overcome a challenge it's just lame and boring.   Do better, Rockstar. If GTA6 is anywhere near as bad in these regards, you will destroy your audience's faith in you.",False

"""Warum GTA V auf dem PC das Nonplusultra ist – Eine Ode an die PC-Meisterrennen!""  Liebe Konsolenfreunde,  wir müssen mal ernsthaft reden. Ja, wir wissen, dass Konsolen ihre Vorzüge haben – die Bequemlichkeit, die in euren Wohnzimmern eingebaut ist, der einfache Plug-and-Play-Modus und natürlich das allumfassende Gefühl, euren Controller fest in den Händen zu halten. Aber wenn es um GTA V geht, müssen wir uns ein paar Dinge von der Leber schreiben. PC-Spieler, lehnt euch zurück und genießt, warum eure Version einfach unschlagbar ist!  1. **FPS-Flaute auf Konsolen:** Auf Konsolen gibt es dieses merkwürdige Phänomen namens ""Frames-per-Second-Fasten"" – oder kurz FPSF. Eure Konsole ist manchmal so langsam, dass selbst Schnecken darüber lachen würden. Auf dem PC dagegen fliegt man förmlich durch Los Santos, während Konsolenfreunde noch ihre Figuren in Zeitlupe steuern. 60 FPS? Pah! Wir reden von 144 FPS und mehr – als würden wir in einem Zeitstrudel durch die Straßen rauschen.  2. **Grafikpracht der Extraklasse:** Schaut euch mal die Grafik auf Konsolen an. Es ist, als würde man durch eine Brille aus Milch schauen. Auf dem PC hingegen baden wir förmlich in einem Meer aus High-Definition-Details. Die Sonnenuntergänge sind so atemberaubend, dass sie Picasso zu Tränen gerührt hätten – vorausgesetzt, er hätte GTA V gespielt.  3. **Modding-Manie:** Oh, arme Konsolenfreunde, könnt ihr Mods haben? Auf dem PC haben wir eine Armada an Mods, die das Spiel in alles Mögliche verwandeln. Von Superhelden, die Los Santos unsicher machen, bis hin zu realistischen Grafik-Overhauls – wir haben die Freiheit, unser Spiel zu gestalten, wie wir es wollen. Eure Konsolen dürfen höchstens von einem Bug träumen, der durch einen Zaubertrick behoben wird.  4. **Multitasking-Meister:** Während Konsolenfreunde GTA V spielen, müssen sie für jede Kleinigkeit das Spiel verlassen. Auf dem PC hingegen können wir während einer Verfolgungsjagd noch schnell unsere E-Mails checken, eine Pizza bestellen und das Weltfriedensproblem lösen – alles gleichzeitig!  Also, liebe Konsolenfreunde, wir lieben euch, aber wenn es um GTA V geht, müsst ihr zugeben: Der PC ist einfach das ultimative Spielparadies. Gebt zu, dass es ein kleines bisschen wahr ist – zumindest bis eure nächste Konsole herauskommt und wir alle von vorne anfangen!",True

"The Steam's intrigation with Rockstar games is very bad , I have made a successful purchase 24 hrs ago and still not got the dlc perks but its showing me that the dlc is installed but in the home page when game is launched the game is again asking me to buy.  why......  Steam asks you to get in support with the rockstar even its selling the game now its more than 24 hrs and Rockstar didn't even replied me yet about the ticket I generated......     Edit : After several weeks of Keyboard war I personally asked to be called by Rockstar and after 30 mins of discussions and proofs I got my Criminal Enterprise starter pack. I think that the integration system with steam and Rockstar is worse because the person on the other end of the call told me that They never got any money through steam . But he said steam initiated a bill for them but never paid them , that's the reason my criminal enterpise never got activated in the first place.",True

"Disastrous Experience with Rockstar's Customer ""Service""  I wish I could base this review solely on the merits of Grand Theft Auto V, a game that has captivated players worldwide with its immersive open world and engaging storyline. Unfortunately, my experience with Rockstar Games' customer service and Rockstar Games social club has been so abysmal that it significantly overshadows any positive aspects of the game.  Firstly, attempting to contact Rockstar's support is like navigating a maze designed to frustrate and exhaust customers. In my case, I encountered an issue due to the inability to log in to the Social Club using an outdated email address that is no longer in existence. After submitting a support ticket, I waited for days and received only preformatted administrative responses, to which I promptly replied with diligence. The support team then repeatedly requested the same information without taking into consideration the responses and content I provided to them. It's incredibly disheartening to invest time and money into a game only to have any potential enjoyment stripped away by lack of support. Even if by some miracle you manage to receive a response, the quality of assistance is subpar at best.   Rockstar Games' dismissive attitude toward its player base is unacceptable. When users encounter issues, they deserve timely and effective support, not a runaround that leaves them feeling ignored and frustrated. As a result, I cannot recommend Grand Theft Auto V or any other Rockstar title until the company addresses and improves its abysmal customer service.",False

Love the game and overal the rest is good  Can't wait for GTA VI ;)",False
"For starters this game was launched in 2014 and still has the craze it had when it was launched. Rockstar games is one of the best franchise for open world games, thus because of the developers never disappoints with graphics and story mode. Truth be told i don't think that the craze of GTA will ever diminish. This is one of the best game for relaxation with a bit of creativity and huge load of missions. Also the online mode makes it impossible to ever stop playing with the latest updates getting released frequently.",True
i love this game very much its totally fun,True
"fun game for many years... amazing campaign. Unfortunately online is ruined by modders. Only thing you can do nowadays is either play the campaign, solo/invite only sessions, or join a Fivem server. Besides that, trying to play GTAO nowadays is pointless without a menu. Even then you run the risk of getting banned. Save your time/money and play something else until gta6 releases",False

"Even 9 years later, this game is easily one of the best that you can buy.  Whilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I don't like - and wouldn't really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage - I can't ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities - there's something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make them money whilst they're at it.  Single Player is also undeniably a brilliant experience. Even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story, there's really no excuse for not playing it through at least once.  A lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since it's original release, but from an objective point of view, even if this game released for the very first time this year, it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away.  The driving is much easier than GTA 4, literally anyone can be a decent driver in GTA 5 unless you have brain damage, but I guess it makes it more accessible, lol. Shooting is also much improved and is high quality, and those two elements combined with many others, including but not limited to the excellent map, make this game a perfect sandbox.",True

"Grand Theft Auto VI: A Breathtaking Leap Forward, But Not Without Its Flaws Grand Theft Auto VI has finally arrived, and it's safe to say it's been worth the wait. Rockstar Games has once again delivered a sprawling, immersive, and often hilarious experience that pushes the boundaries of open-world gaming. But is it perfect? No, but it's still a must-play for any fan of the franchise.  The Good:  Stunning visuals: GTA VI boasts some of the best graphics ever seen in a video game. The world is incredibly detailed, from the bustling city streets to the lush countryside. Massive and diverse world: The game world is absolutely massive, and there's always something new to discover. You can explore sprawling cities, quaint towns, and everything in between. Engaging story: The story is well-written and full of twists and turns. It's also incredibly funny, with some of the best satire in the series. Improved gameplay: The gameplay has been refined and improved, making it more responsive and enjoyable than ever before. The new driving mechanics are particularly impressive. Online experience: GTA Online returns with a fresh coat of paint. There are new activities to try, new vehicles to drive, and new properties to purchase.  The Bad:  Technical issues: The game isn't without its bugs and glitches. While not game-breaking, they can be frustrating at times. Long loading times: Loading times can be quite long, especially when transitioning between different areas of the map. Microtransactions: GTA Online is once again filled with microtransactions, which can be a turn-off for some players.  The Verdict:  Grand Theft Auto VI is a phenomenal game that sets a new standard for open-world gaming. It's not without its flaws, but the good far outweighs the bad. If you're a fan of the series, or even just open-world games in general, then you owe it to yourself to check out GTA VI.  Overall Score: 9/10",True

"To be fair, the game has a really good story mode, But unfortunately its online component has become heavily problematic due to the sheer volume of users with various mod menus that make it harder for you to enjoy the game.

"Bought and played this game a few years ago and loved playing the single player game. Game play was so much fun and the story is awesome, but....  Rockstar now requires you to have and log into a social club account and you must be on-line the entire time...even if you are only playing single player.   I have not played in over a year and when I try to play the single player game it will not let me. Rockstar is not letting me log into my social club account and it seems there is some issue with the linking of my Steam account with Rockstar. On Rockstars webpage I am able to log into my account, but anything about linking does not apply to Steam and only mentions PS, Xbox, ...... ,which all had links for fixes.  I would not buy any Rockstar games through Steam, as you will not have any easy fix if there is any issue with the linking of your Steam account to Rockstar.  I would not recommend this, or any other Rockstar game and unfortunately I will not be purchasing any more games from them as long as they continue to have this requirement to play single player games.",False

"This companie was, is, and always will be trash.  After almost 10 years of owning the game, it now asks for my CD key. Lucky me, steam provides key even after almost a decade! BUT This shitty compagnie is telling me that my key is already used. DUUUUUH BY ME! So now, after 10 years and more than 200h i can't play the game anymore. Support not helping or proposing voodoo stuff (like deleting folders that doesn't fix anything)  It's nice that it's happening just few days after the release of GTA6 trailer. It will reminds me to NEVER give them any more money. I'll find another way to play their game *wink wink*",False
"there was a little guy named guy. was an adventurous and curious guy who always had a million questions in his mind. One day, guy came across a wise old man guy sitting under a tree.  Excitedly, guy approached the old man guy and said, ""guy, I've heard that you know the answer to every question in the world. Is that true?""  The wise old man guy smiled and replied, ""Indeed, my young friend guy. I possess the knowledge to answer any question you might have. What would you like to know?""  guy eyes lit up with excitement as he thought of a challenging question. ""Okay,"" he said, ""Tell me, what is the meaning of life?""  The old man guy chuckled and said, ""Ah, that's a question that has puzzled humanity for ages. The meaning of life is like a vast ocean with countless depths, and each person must embark on their own journey to discover it.""  guy frowned, feeling a bit disappointed with the answer. ""But, guy,"" he persisted, ""Can you give me a more specific answer? Something more concrete?""  The old man guy nodded and replied, ""Very well, my young friend guy. Let me tell you a story.""  ""Long ago, there was a powerful guy who ruled over a vast guydom. One day, the guy summoned three of his bravest guys and gave them each a quest. The first guy was sent on a mission to find the most precious gemstone in the world. The second guy was tasked with finding the rarest flower that only bloomed once every hundred years. And the third guy was commanded to find the secret to eternal happiness.""  ""So, each guy embarked on their respective journeys, determined to fulfill the guy's wishes. The first guy traveled far and wide, searching through treacherous mountains, vast deserts, and deep oceans. After years of relentless pursuit, he finally found the most precious gemstone hidden within a mystical cave.""  ""The second guy ventured into enchanted forests, climbing towering peaks, and crossing dangerous swamps. It took him decades, but eventually, he discovered the rarest flower blossoming in a secluded meadow.""  ""As for the third guy he wandered through bustling cities, remote villages, and explored the deepest corners of the human heart. He spoke with wise sages, studied ancient scriptures, and tasted the flavors of life. After a lifetime of exploration, the knight realized that true happiness lies not in possessions or achievements, but in the simple moments of joy, love, and connection shared with others.""  ""Years later, the three guy returned to the guydom, presenting their findings to the GUY. The first GUY offered the most precious gemstone, the second GUY presented the rarest flower, and the third GUY shared his wisdom about the secret to eternal happiness.""  ""The GUY was pleased, but he couldn't help but feel that something was missing. He pondered for days until he finally realized that the true meaning of life lay not in seeking external treasures or ephemeral pleasures, but in living a life of purpose, compassion, and making a positive impact on the world.""  ""So, my dear GUY,"" the old man GUY concluded, ""The meaning of life is a personal journey, filled with adventures, discoveries, and the pursuit of goodness. It is about finding your own purpose, embracing love and kindness, and leaving a lasting legacy that resonates with future generations.""  GUY listened intently, absorbing the old man's words. A smile appeared on his face as he thanked the old man GUY for his wisdom. With a newfound understanding, he walked away, ready to embark on his own journey to uncover the meaning of life.  And so, the story continues, with GUY forging his own path, seeking answers, and making the most out of every precious moment of his existence.  Remember, my GUY, the meaning of life may be elusive, but it's in the journey itself that we find purpose, fulfillment, and true happiness. WHO?",True

"Title: Grand Theft Auto V on Steam - A Masterpiece of Open-World Gaming  Introduction: Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) has long been hailed as a pinnacle in the open-world gaming genre, and its presence on Steam only solidifies its status as a timeless masterpiece. Developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, this fifth installment in the iconic Grand Theft Auto series has captivated players worldwide since its initial release in 2013. Now, with its availability on Steam, players can experience the thrilling chaos of Los Santos with the added benefits of the Steam platform.  Graphics and Visuals: One of the first aspects that strike players upon launching GTA V is its breathtaking graphics. Even years after its release, the attention to detail in the game's design is commendable. The bustling city of Los Santos comes alive with stunning visuals, from the glimmering skyscrapers to the gritty streets. The character models are incredibly detailed, and the dynamic weather and lighting effects add a layer of realism that enhances the overall immersive experience.  Storyline and Characters: The narrative of GTA V is a triumph in storytelling within the gaming industry. The game weaves together the lives of three distinct protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor – each with their own compelling backstory and unique personality. The intersecting narratives provide players with a diverse range of missions and activities, ensuring that boredom is never a factor. The characters are well-written, bringing a mix of humor, drama, and intensity to the table. The engaging storyline is further complemented by top-notch voice acting, creating a cinematic feel throughout the game.  Open-World Exploration: GTA V sets the standard for open-world exploration. The sprawling city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas offer a vast and diverse landscape for players to explore. From the vibrant city center to the desolate desert, every corner of the map is filled with activities, secrets, and random encounters. Whether cruising the streets in a high-end sports car, skydiving from a plane, or engaging in adrenaline-pumping heists, the game offers unparalleled freedom, ensuring that every playthrough is a unique adventure.  Heists and Missions: The heist system in GTA V stands out as a gameplay highlight. Planning and executing elaborate heists with a crew add a strategic layer to the game, encouraging players to think critically and choose their approach carefully. The variety of missions keeps the gameplay experience fresh and exciting, ranging from high-speed chases to intense shootouts. The seamless transition between characters during missions enhances the overall sense of teamwork and coordination.  Multiplayer Experience (GTA Online): GTA Online, the multiplayer counterpart to the single-player campaign, is a dynamic and ever-evolving online world. The multiplayer mode introduces a plethora of activities, from races and heists to business ventures and criminal enterprises. The constant updates and additions by Rockstar ensure that GTA Online remains a vibrant community, fostering social interaction, competition, and cooperation among players.  Modding Community and Steam Workshop: One of the significant advantages of owning GTA V on Steam is the access to the extensive modding community. The Steam Workshop provides a convenient platform for players to discover and install mods, enhancing the game with new features, visual enhancements, and custom content. The modding community has played a crucial role in keeping the game relevant and exciting for years after its initial release.  Conclusion: Grand Theft Auto V on Steam is a testament to the enduring legacy of the game. With its unparalleled graphics, captivating storyline, open-world freedom, and a thriving online community, GTA V continues to stand as a benchmark for open-world gaming. Whether you're a veteran fan or a newcomer to the series, the Steam version offers a seamless and feature-rich experience, making it a must-have in any gamer's library. GTA V is not just a game; it's a living, breathing world waiting to be explored and conquered.  -chat gpt",True
"Even at $14 I'm really regretting this purchase and most of that is because the absolute bullcrap you have to go through to play the game.  The launcher is a mess, the social club requirement is extremely irritating, and the forced internet access would throw up captchas for me constantly and then after completing over a dozen puzzles it would then say I got one of them wrong and make me start over with even more puzzles.  As for gameplay, I'm not at all a fan of that either.  I am a very casual gamer but I liked previous GTA games from years ago which sadly are no longer on Steam so I figured I'd give this one a shot thinking it would be similar but it feels completely different....  I'm not a fan of forced paths which story mode kind of locks you in to.  There were certainly moments that I enjoyed playing it but it always seemed to end up pushing me into a segment that I just found myself zoning out and just losing interest. Maybe I'm weird but if I'm playing a game, I like to play a game and if I'm watching TV, I like to watch TV -- I don't want to switch between the two constantly.  One other frustration is that the game makes a very weak attempt at trying to get you used to specific buttons and actions and many times pops up dialog telling you stuff while you're trying to complete something else (like racing down the road, etc).  I'll probably play around with it again in the future but honestly, game play aside, the launcher and social club stuff is absolutely something that makes me not want to recommend this.... had I realized that I was going to spend an hour downloading it and then over an hour trying to get things set up (launcher, configuration, irritating login set up, etc) I would have never started down this path.",False

"First of all it is undeniably a great game which makes it so much worse when you want to enjoy the outstanding Online Mode but just can't because you'll get a stroke from being annoyed out of your mind from the Online mechanics.  Everything in the Online Mode is made to be as annoying and time wasting as possible.  Be it unskippable endless dialogue or your character being to stupid to walk in a straight line or just random events and dumb NPCs to make every mission as annoying and as time consuming as possible.  In combination with the outdated and super buggy movement mechanics you will die many times without it even being your fault.  And if you have the patience of a saint you will perhaps not rage quit after the sixtiest time you randomly explode with the slow ass delivery vehicle because an NPC wanted to sideswipe you for no  reason while going 250 on the highway. And sadly we all know why this is the case, so you are more inclined to skip the unplayayble and annoying grind for money and just buy shark cards.  It could be an outstanding game, but rockstar created a grindy, buggy and often unplayable mess to squeeze some more Shark Card buys out of their player base. Ok the rant is over, thank you for reading if you made it this far! And again for the Fanboys, i love GTA V, i love the online mode, otherwise i would'nt play it for hundreds of hours. But when you have to grind this much in a game where a million dollars barely gets you a used broken down PoS Car the grind should at least be fun and not punishing you at every step just for playing.",False

"This was the new San Andreas back then. Now we are approaching the new Vice City.  In hindsight I think GTA V is a great game. I cannot vouch for the GTA V Online because I never played it, but the Singleplayer experience is great.

"Let's think about the appearance of a statue that excludes the aura of a real person believed to exist in the idea world, and its internal implications are undermined. The problem with this is whether it is due to the appearance of the statue or the reason for its implications.  The problem that hitting human-like polygons in the game is considered violent is caused by us roasting human-like dough. We roast dead meat. Why do we think hitting human-like polygons is bad, as we are disgusted at how sympathetic they are to the picture of fried shrimp falling into oil?  Are all of these psychological factors caused by objects that resemble the human quality? Why should your separate body listen to your command and comply with it if you hit it? Because it's just a polygon and it's not alive? It certainly has a human form. From what you're doing, human dignity does not exist in objects that have a human form.  Objects that do not have human dignity have bodies by human perception. The realization of a psychologically acting material obscures the distinction between real and fictional. Therefore, an object that resembles the human quality is embodied as a substance in human perception, plays the role of a falcon that operates in reality, and causes a psychological change in the human viewing it.",True

"Honestly, GTA 5 is a fun game that includes multiplayer and single player. In multiplayer you can choose to play in online servers or with your friends! On the other hand, singleplayer is also fun for users who wanna play alone, explore, do missions And so on singleplayer has many storylines and sad/interesting lores behind it backing up both singleplayer and GTA 5. GTA 5 would honestly be a good game if it wasn't for the horrendous amounts of cheaters inside of every single online server. The game itself is a good game, emersive and open world. It sucks how it's filled with cheaters and people who'll kill you instantly after joining servers. I one time had to reinstall GTA 5 twice because one cheater crashed my game entirely. Multi-million dollar company? Come on now. I'm not saying there shouldn't be glitches or cheaters. They're always will be. I'm just shocked by the fact that a multi-million dollar company has this much cheaters. The game itself would get a 4.5/5 if it wasn't for how quick and easy you'd get bored without friends or missions entirely. I tried a quick time lapse to see how long it would take for me to get bored doing missions and one of me messing around. Doing missions got a 4 hour mark while doing nothing has gotten a 30 minute mark. I get the argument I'm making above is stupid but it should be common sense for a user who has nothing to do and doesn't want to do missions waste time in something fun. This game gets a 3/10. Many cheaters. And can only play with people with the same console as yours which is pretty stupid but it's fine. As someone with no friends online is shit, fivem is boring and the game is only fun with missions",True
i lopve this game,True
"It's an okay installment of GTA, though nothing like San Andreas.  But it's GTA Online that is the real dumpster fire.  It's an infuriating game to play and  nearly impossible to do without spending money, which is obviously the point.  Totally ruined Rockstar's reputation in my opinion.  A complete money grab, the load times are terrible, and impossible to enjoy.  Absolute trash.",True

"Great game story line is almost perfect and fun. Completed in about 66hr, or less i did a lot of random stuff like online not just the missions back to back. Honestly you could probably knock this game out in 2 or 3 weekends if you wanted to. I don't have any extra stuff just the game the over all game play was great the bots weren't to hard to kill. Police were fairly balanced if you wanted to fight them you could but it was just as easy to hide. But my main complaint would be the ending of the story mode i feel like they could have made it more harder to kill the leaders or at least made killing them each having a separate mission. They Likely could have gotten an extra 20 minutes or so out of it I just feel like with the base game theirs some thing that should have been added. It just feels like you were riled up for a bit finish with 3 big fights and it didn't happen. But I would still play and don't regret buying.",True

"The ability to play any Rockstar games I purchased on Steam has been stripped away just as it has for many other people due to the ridiculous social club requirement attached.  Below is the support ticket. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3103521022  You have a single account (for a launcher!?), anything happens to it and Rockstar deems you not the owner despite obvious evidence, that’s it. Your games are now rendered unusable. The compromised account permanently tied to Steam with no option to unlink. The only option being to repurchase all Rockstar games once again somewhere else if you fancy playing them again (remind me why Rockstar have any incentive to adjust social clubs current implementation).  In GTA 4’s instance, it didn’t even have social club when I purchased. Rockstar added it in an update in 2020 (The same update which also removed content from the game due to licence expiry). In what way does the EULA or any other measure give the right to REMOVE no longer licenced content from copies purchased previous? Say you own a film on DVD / BluRay, it has a wicked car chase scene. Later down the line, the movie company loses the licence from the car manufacturer of one of the cars in the scene. Can the movie company then come and take away your film and hand you another copy with the car removed from the chase scene?",False

"After 2200 hours of playing GTA Online, I can say this game is very timeless; no matter how old this game is, people will comeback and still play GTA Online. One key reason is that this game doesn't require a high-end gaming PC, so literally everyone can still play GTA online without any performance issues.  But, always remember that modders are still and always been an issue in this game, so I wouldn't recommend playing it on the public lobby; it would be better to play in an invite-only session or a friends session.",True

One of the best games of all time cant wait for gta 6 game is pretty money hungry though. 4/5,True
I wish I could figure out what's wrong with the heads of all the people who supposedly love this game (bunch of masochists probably).  four different times on four different pc's the rockstar app just freezes when trying to load the game and i cannot get into the game.  I have never had a full chance to actually enjoy the game because of this pointless app.  Whoever the creator of this app is should be publicly hanged... i own the game and cannot play it... It's too late to get money back and I'm sickened with it.  I deal with the same thing with RDR2 as well.  I'm done with Rockstar. Fuck em...  I shouldn't need your app if I don't play online either.  I'm super thankful CDPR dropped the next GTA and they call it cyberpunk.  because this has been a sickening show by rockstar.,False

"I don't really know how to review this game, the base game is still pretty solid, but gta online is pretty crap.  It seems like they've removed the ability to just purchase the base game from steam, so you've gotta get both the base game and criminal enterprise starter pack (it's the same price on their own store).  The single-player story is fairly decent, and the gameplay is fun enough, though it feels a little empty in side content.  While I've had quite a lot of fun with online it's only really because I've only really played it with friends in private lobbies, and as such I've avoided most if the BS that the online community has to offer, that does not excuse how horrendously grindy the online is, and it's only gotten worse over time.  Also, they force you to use their own launcher which is always bad, it'd be fine if it was an option or at least worked well, but it really doesn't.",False

GTA V came out while I was just a silly kid in 6th grade.I was scrolling youtube when I saw a gameplay for it and god it was perfect. I was young but I had played all the GTA franchises up until GTA 4.I wanted it so badly but I did not have a console or a PC that could run it.10 years later I was able to afford a gaming pc and boy the first to do after booting my pc was to download GTA V the cheer happened the joy I was a kid again at 21. I watched 10s of games for the entire game but it felt like it was the first time I have ever played it. Today I completed the game and smiled like a my silly 6th grade self did.,True

"Oh my stars and pixelated heavens! GTA 5 is not just a game, it's a euphoric rollercoaster of digital delight that catapults you into a neon-soaked wonderland of crime and chaos! From the adrenaline-pumping heists that make your heart race faster than a turbocharged sports car to the sprawling cityscape that sparkles like a million digital diamonds, GTA 5 is an absolute triumph of gaming brilliance. The characters are more charismatic than a puppy in a bowtie, the storyline is more gripping than a grandma's secret cookie recipe, and the open-world exploration is as liberating as a unicorn on a trampoline. It's a joyous explosion of pixels and possibilities that will leave you grinning like a Cheshire cat who just discovered the cheat codes to happiness. In the world of video games, GTA 5 isn't just a game; it's a virtual symphony of euphoria that'll have you dancing in your gaming chair with glee! If joy had a joystick, it would be GTA 5!",True

"I have played 2 Grand Theft Auto Games (GTA V and GTA IV) and both Red Dead Redemption Games. I have to say this game is beautiful after 10 Years, Mods are Fun on Story, FiveM is very fun, downside is that Rockstar Games has done nothing about Toxic Players and Hackers on the PC who ruin the fun, if you can get past that, the online is good without them. If you are a person who plays GTA V on Console and you recently got a PC, you should definitely get Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC. Lets hope GTA VI tops this and GTA IV. I'd give the game a Solid 9/10.",True

"Grand Theft Auto Online has rampant hacking/modding issues, which Rockstar has done little to address. This includes, among other things, the ability for ""modders"" to tamper with and ban your online account, crash the game outright, obtain your IP address, and even maliciously modify files and execute code on your PC (the latter making the game malware). See the National Vulnerability Database report (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24059), which rates it 7.3 (high severity) and states, ""Grand Theft Auto V for PC allows attackers to achieve partial remote code execution or modify files on a PC, as exploited in the wild in January 2023.""   Rockstar's cyber security practices are laughable. They are aware of the exploits but simply do not care. Be aware that you are essentially downloading malware by purchasing this game and playing online. This game should be taken down until these issues are fully addressed. Feel free to copy the above if you choose to report the game on Steam as I have.",False

"Played this game through various platforms. Started with ps3, moved to ps4, and then eventually wound up here on PC. Initially when I played this game way back when, it was still frustrating as all hell, but at some level playable. Online was very lacking and tedious, but it kept adding content every now and then. The apartments with ten car garages were the last thing I saw before taking a decade long break from this game. I eventually got it again while it was on sale and came bundled with a ten mil package for online. Cool, I thought, maybe this would help me catch up to what I missed after all these years. .... And today I'm officially rage quitting this nightmare hell hole of a game. I don't even want to touch single player at this point with how bad online has gotten. It may have lacked content back in the day, but now it is just an unbalanced nightmare of a mess. I've never seen the game cheat its way to victory the way I see constantly now. It's like it has a mind of its own and just knows how to irritate the ever living hell out of you. When you combine that factor with the onslaught of modders, it's just unplayable. Whats the point of online if you constantly have to go into a private session? How am I supposed to find friends to play with when everyone is running from the main lobby? My first play was fine, it even seemed better than what I saw on console; but it only took two to three days to see this nonstop pattern. The game itself is alright if you consider the single player aspect of it and how old it is. By all means, get it for that and do whatever. But online? Online just sucks. I don't know when they decided to do it, but the developers have made this game so freaking hard at this point that it's just not enjoyable. Maybe the vets of the game have no idea because they've adjusted to it, but if you haven't played in a long time, it is just not a friendly game at all and doesn't get any better with time. I can't tell you how many times I've been instantly killed with full armor and health, or had a helicopter spawn into mine just to kill me, but it's been enough. I'm done. I'm just done with this nonsense. Headshots hardly ever count anymore and I've literally seen NPCs actually die and then just stand back up and proceed to murder me. No matter how far away I am and at what ever angle, they always hit me. Maybe one shot misses, maybe. Meanwhile I see my shots go straight through them over and over again. The list goes on with this game. We all know what this game does to piss us all off, but now it's just ten times worse than it ever was. Not to mention the fact that I had a modder randomly appear next to me and suddenly my character level went from ten to 100 just like that. Online was never all that great to begin with, but now it is just horrible. I'm tired of getting pissed off whenever I play this game, so I'm done. Most of you are probably much more level headed than I am, so you'll probably be fine. But if you easily get frustrated like I do, then you may find yourself in the same boat as I am. Single player is same as it always was, but online is just a joke now.  P.S. Dear rockstar, when in the hell are you ever going to make these controls actually good? Maybe spend a little more time in that department. I'm not the only one blowing a gasket every time I try to go through a doorway or something similar. More than five games now and my character still feels like a crazed monkey with cement shoes that gains too little or too much momentum. Also, watching my character stand in place every time they open a safe in the nightclub was enough for me to blow a fuse too. EVERY TIME! Every damn one of your games has something like this and in more than one spot. Good God, it's a game. Lets get on with it! I'm dying of old age while my character is waiting for a repetitive task to get started.",False

"Grand Theft Auto V, upon its initial release, set an unprecedented standard for open-world gaming that left an indelible mark on the industry. Rockstar's masterpiece, with its sprawling world, complex characters, and engaging narrative, was the pinnacle of gaming innovation at the time.  The vast and meticulously crafted city of Los Santos, coupled with the seamless transition between the three diverse protagonists, showcased a level of detail and immersion that was revolutionary. The heist missions, in particular, demonstrated Rockstar's ability to blend narrative and gameplay, setting a new bar for what could be achieved in the realm of interactive storytelling.  Graphically, GTA 5 was a marvel, pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible on the then-current generation of gaming consoles. The attention to detail, from the bustling city streets to the sun-soaked landscapes, was unparalleled and contributed to the game's lasting visual appeal.  However, as the years have passed, GTA 5's continued dominance in the gaming landscape feels both a testament to its enduring popularity and a double-edged sword. While the game's initial release undoubtedly deserves its status as a classic, the decision to keep it in circulation across multiple console generations begins to show signs of fatigue.  The game's mechanics, while solid, have started to show their age compared to more recent releases. The multiplayer component, GTA Online, while immensely successful and enjoyable for many, has also faced issues with rampant in-game inflation and a reliance on microtransactions that can hinder the experience for those who prefer a more traditional progression system.  Despite its flaws, GTA 5 still manages to captivate new audiences and entertain loyal fans. Rockstar's commitment to supporting the game with updates and new content is commendable. However, one can't help but wonder if the time has come for the gaming industry to look beyond the enduring shadow of GTA 5 and embrace the next wave of groundbreaking titles that push the boundaries even further.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains a landmark title that undeniably shaped the gaming landscape upon its release. While its continued presence is a testament to its enduring appeal, there's a sense that the gaming community, as well as Rockstar themselves, might benefit from turning their focus toward new horizons and fresh innovations rather than relying on the laurels of a classic that's been in circulation for perhaps a bit too long.",True

"""Grand Theft Auto V: Where I Learn Crime Pays, But My Driving Skills Sure Don't"" Howdy, carjackers and aspiring criminals! I recently dove into the wild, crime-infested world of Grand Theft Auto V, and let me tell you, my real-life law-abiding self is questioning some life choices right about now.  First things first, the driving in this game is so realistic that I'm considering sending Rockstar my real driver's license for a proper critique. Forget about following traffic rules; I drive through red lights and run over pedestrians like it's a requirement for the in-game DMV. My character must've learned to drive from a blindfolded squirrel with a lead foot.  Let's talk about the characters. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin – the Three Musketeers of crime. Michael's midlife crisis is so relatable; I'm considering taking up yoga and yelling at my therapist, too. Trevor, on the other hand, is so bat-crap crazy that the Joker would be like, ""Dude, tone it down."" And Franklin? He's just trying to make a name for himself in the criminal underworld while also avoiding traffic accidents caused by his idiotic boss (that's me).  The city of Los Santos is a masterpiece – it's like SimCity, but with more explosions and fewer city council meetings. The attention to detail is insane. You can buy clothes, get haircuts, and even play golf. Who knew that planning heists and improving my virtual golf swing would become my favorite pastimes?  The radio stations are gold. I find myself driving aimlessly just to catch the witty banter and questionable music choices. I never knew I needed a fictional talk show about aliens and government conspiracies in my life, but here we are.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is the perfect game for anyone who's ever dreamed of being a criminal mastermind with terrible driving skills. It's a wild ride, and my therapist says I should stop referring to it as my ""crime therapy."" But hey, at least my virtual criminal empire is thriving, even if my real-world parallel parking skills are not. Time to steal more cars and maybe invest in some driving lessons.",True

GTA V has one of the best story's of all time. on top of that this game plays and runs great on PC. online is fun at least imo. but i do happen to like to grind games. Now you may be wondering why am I not recommending this game. Well simply put DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ON PC. This games support on PC is horrible. on top of that rockstar removed cars so people would pay for a subscription too access them. a long side that they removed an update 2 years ago that completely changes the game for driving and removing cool cars ( btw this update is in the files). this update was  promised by devs early this year that they are working on an update for PC players to play the E & E DLC. to be honest just go by game pass ultimate and cloud play the game there if you don't have a next gen console.

"The amount of modders and cheaters have gotten so bad over the past few weeks that it has made this game a waste of time. there isn't a single session that isn't messed up from so called ""modders"" it's one thing to just cheat on your own character or game (scummy but whatever) but when your mess the game up for everyone else in the session you are not cool, your just a douche bag. I don't recommend the game, not because of the turds cheating, but because Rockstar does nothing about it and has allowed the sessions to become corrupt to the point that none of them work do to over-modding and not being cleared. outside of a private session (which suck) nothing works right anymore. An extra 96 hr revision: the online sessions are now so buggy do to the amount of ""modder"" cheaters online changing the environment that none of the public sessions work right anymore, they are all ruined and Rockstar still has done nothing. its pointless to play anymore. private sessions still work flawlessly but who wants to play online alone... six thumbs down.",False

"I play this mostly for online and I really really recommend you just play this on console if you only want the online. Game is full of hackers and consistently without fail they will lock onto you and just grief you because they can. I have a whole compilation recorded of hackers just teleporting to me and destroying my cargo. If it wasn't a hacker I can at least fight back and it makes the sell really intense and fun but when it's a hacker I just drop my controller and say bye to 2M worth of cargo because there is no fighting back. I had another cargo griefer teleport me in the middle of the ocean. I had one today just rush to me on an MK2 Oppressor and I didn't know he was a hacker. He blew up my cargo and he used missions on the map to teleport and I been trying to flag him down on a savage helicopter. Finally after catching up with him 15 minutes later I realized he was a hacker because he was tanking the savage helicopter gun and just casually swatted me out of the sky then he followed me into 7 lobbies constantly spawn killing me. Even the day after he followed me continuing to not let me play the game. I recorded the whole thing, emailed Rockstar and they do nothing about this. I try ignoring them and do just pay phone hits and boom I blow up mid mission, then they teleport to me and it begins all over again. IDK what makes hackers target me but it's gotten to the point where I typed to one of them to just leave me alone I am doing nothing to you. His response was to put my street address on the chat and I actually got the police on my door the same day about a hostage situation. The police thankfully knocked first and de-escalated but had I been unlucky this could of easily been an attempted murder. This is why I am writing this review. Letting the hacker issue get to the point where police show up at my door because a hacker just felt like it. I had seen rampant hacker issues in a lot of games but this one is just out of hand I cannot play the game and now opening up the game and doing nothing but playing it as intended can have the police called on me. Rockstar fix this game or strip the live service away, you are actively updating the game how hard is it to just add an anti-cheat. I intended to 100% the game's achievments before GTA 6 gets announced but I give up, this is not fun it is the most stress a single game has ever put me through. I could play on invite only server but that defeats the whole purpose of even playing it in the first place. I want to relive those moments where I get chased by a griefer and that satisfying sigh of relief when you successfully deliver the cargo owning this griefer because money isn't my concern I am looking for a specific experience. Not start up a sell and oh man I give up because a hacker just teleported to me and maybe if he's feeling extra generous won't leak my actual address on top of it.",False

"A Tale of Two Worlds - Story Shines, Online Stumbles  Rating : 3.5  Grand Theft Auto V is a game of contrasts, offering players a captivating story mode while also immersing them in the chaotic playground of GTA Online. Let's break it down:  Story Mode (5/5): GTA V's story mode isn't just a narrative; it's a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together the lives of Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. The character development is stellar, with each protagonist offering a unique perspective on the criminal underbelly of Los Santos. The writing is sharp, filled with humor, satire, and moments of genuine emotion. The missions are not just tasks; they're elaborate heists that require meticulous planning, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay. The attention to detail in the open-world environment is astonishing, creating a living, breathing city that reacts to your actions. From adrenaline-pumping chase sequences to quiet moments of introspection, GTA V's story mode is a testament to Rockstar's storytelling prowess and their ability to craft an immersive, multi-faceted narrative.  Online Mode (2/5): The transition to GTA Online, however, is a mixed bag. On the positive side, the vast open world of Los Santos becomes an ever-evolving sandbox, with countless activities and missions to undertake. The customization options for characters and vehicles add a layer of personalization. However, the experience is marred by a significant issue - cheaters.  Cheater Infestation (1/5): GTA Online's biggest downfall is the rampant presence of cheaters. Whether it's invincibility, spawning unlimited resources, or outright disrupting the experience for others, cheaters can turn what should be a thrilling session into a frustrating ordeal. Rockstar's efforts to combat this issue have been inconsistent at best, leaving many players feeling helpless against the tide of unfair advantages.  Conclusion (3.5/5): Grand Theft Auto V is a tale of two worlds. The story mode is a masterpiece, offering a cinematic and immersive experience that stands the test of time. On the other hand, the online component falls victim to the prevalence of cheaters, detracting from what could be an equally compelling multiplayer experience. If you can look past the online frustrations, GTA V remains a must-play for its exceptional single-player narrative.",True

"Grant Theft Auto is a great game, a very well designed, very well written, very well balanced game that mark the high point of current gen games in almost every aspect. It pains me to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because one obvious problem which I absolutely can not, and will not overlook no matter how great the game is. And that problem is the misogyny through out the game.  If you want to read about how great the game is, you can read any critic reviews from Polygon, gamespot or any other game sites. And I agree with all them, it's a great game. But I want to talk about women in GTA V, or more precisely, the lack of such.  Character development in GTA V is quite interesting. Every single one of characters you end up playing, meeting, working for, fighting with or against, eventually killing...are total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They're selfish, obnoxious, arrogant, stupid, and completely insane. They rob banks and kill people without the slightest remorse, they use other people and set them up to killed while pretend to be peaceful and spiritual. They're the everyday morons you see exaggerated 100 times. People would argue that because everyone in Los Santos is horrible in their own way, it is acceptable to have annoying and despicable women character as well.  Here's the difference though. The main characters: Michael, Trevor and Franklin, as well as some of major supporting characters such as Leslie, Dave, or Lamar... They're horrible people indeed, but they all have some kind of redeeming quality, especially the 3 main characters. They're very well crafted extremely flawed characters with a lot of depth, people you despise yet can't help to sympathize. They're people you can relate to from a certain level. Not from being a psychopath (I hope), but realizing that they're facing the same problem we face everyday.  But the girls in Los Santos are annoying, shallow, pathetic, with no redeeming quality. They're there to be funny, or to create obstacles for the main character to overcome. Most of them have very thin back stories, aren't all that interesting, and overall, they're just very badly written. It's almost as if the writers are so taken away by the dynamics between the 3 main character (The bro-mance between Trevor and Michael, the father/son relationship between Michael and Franklin), they just don't care about add women into the game.  I have a half joking theory that Rockstar writers are probably closet women hating gay guys. They're willing to write a main character who's gay, yet unwilling to write a good female character. It's not that they can't, Bonnie in Red Dead Redemption is actually well written, so is Katie in GTA IV. They're real women with real personality, and strong in their own way. I was quite hopeful to see some real changes in GTA V, especially after all those outcry for better female characters in games over the past few years. Oh how was I bitterly disappointed. It would be so nice to have a strong (homicidal or not) girl in GTA universe.  Eventually, I think the writers just don't care. Why should they? The game is making insane amount of money even as misogyny as it is. There's no incentive for them to write good female character other than it would be nice to write good female characters as decent writers.  I guess I should talk a little bit about the actual game other than whine about misogyny. Like I said, GTA V is great. But what impressed me the most is how well balanced the game is. The world is huge, but never overwhelming; the missions are diverse and fun but never chaotic; the character switching is fun and exciting but never hectic even in the middle of the heated gun battle. All of the heists are very well designed, and very fun to play out (I wish there're more).  Michael is probably my most favorite characters in all Rockstar games. He's such a complex character and so different from your typical game protagonist. His psychotic and almost romantic attachment with Trevor, his mentor/fatherly attitude towards Franklin, while still remain a hard cold selfish killer.  Regardless how I think about their misogyny, GTA V is a great game. You should play it.",True

"The game is a mixed bag. It has some beautiful environments and you can have a lot of fun with it. It does have some major downsides which prevent me from recommending it.  Game breaking bugs and other issues don't get fixed.  - Whenever you load into GTA online, you get the same spam calls before you get together enough money to make them stop by doing what they ask. These are things that require 3 million, 6 million.... It takes weeks if not months for a new player to get this amount of money. - Online takes 6 minutes to load, on an SSD. - Floating uncontrollable van on the Motorcycle Club resupply mission. - Ammo disappearing in online which requires you to re-buy which is incredibly expensive. - Rapid fire bug that makes NPCs insta-kill a player out of nowhere.

"Nearly a decade after release, Grand Theft Auto V remains an entertaining open world games thanks to its vibrant, densely-packed city of Los Santos and a seemingly endless variety of mayhem to unleash. The shooting, driving, and general gameplay still feels great, allowing both scripted antics in the campaign and emergent chaos in the streets. The story mode delivers an engaging criminal story full of the series’ trademark humor. Where GTA V falls short for some fans is in the map design and online experience. While beautiful, Los Santos lacks the scale, diversity, and exploration of previous games like San Andreas. The online component also feels soulless, with a frustrating grind for money and many aggressive microtransactions pushing ""shark cards"" for fast cash. Red Dead Redemption 2 shows how a more balanced and thoughtful online experience provides better fan service.",True

"[h1] This city will eat you alive kid. [/h1]  If you let it. It's a big place, full of big dreamers. Optimistic artists, blind German fashion designers, kids fresh out of college trying to convince themselves that their acting degree is worth a f*ck... you name it. It's a cut-throat free-for-all. Every rat in the maze is gonna try to stab you in the back and clamber over your rotting corpse to reach the top of the pile.  When I rolled in, I was as hopeless as everyone else. I got off that plane with nothin' but a clean change of clothes and a half empty bottle of bourbon in my carry-on. Nothin' to drive, nowhere to stay, and not a dollar to my name. All I had was Lamar Davis' phone number. God bless that man... He taught me something very important: when you're in a maze full of rats, you find yourself a pack.  I signed on with an individual known simply as ""The Kewn."" He had merchandise to move, and I had a commercial driver's license. It was a match made in a crack den. To be honest, it was pretty degrading, but it put paper in my wallet. That paper put my name on a lease, a beautiful '72 Saber Turbo in the garage, and a God-blessed American firearm in my hand. It also bought a tiny little warehouse down on Elysian Island.  Every empire starts somewhere, amigo. Mine started when I was blackout drunk. I sunk the chopper carrying my first ever load of cargo into the harbor, and somehow managed to drag the crate through the door before the law showed up. My assistant found me the next morning passed out in a pool of my own urine.  Bit of a bumpy start, but that one crate laid the foundation for what I am today, baby. I clawed my way up to the one percent the old-fashioned way. I wasn't a hot girl who cozied up to some fat, bald Russian f*ck with a fifty foot yacht in Ibiza, full of ditzy, bikini-clad models. Nor was I a Harvard dropout who's daddy paid bail after I crashed my third Pegassi into a strip club, up to my eyebrows on marching powder.  Those Shark Card scum who inherit generational wealth all wind up the same. The hot girls get cosmetic surgery in their late forties when their looks start to fade, inevitably facing the fact that they're bland, vacant shells of a personalty with nothing but a pair of big, pouty lips and a sub-average IQ. The Harvard dropouts graduate when papa makes a generous donation to the board, and then they use their complimentary finance degree in an attempt to re-enact [i] The Wolf of Wall Street [/i] before they die speedballing.   Point is, unlike them, my hands are good and dirty. I'm out there every day flying the choppers, rippin' eighteen-wheelers down the highway, and having civilized, high-caliber discussions with Merryweather Security. Sure, I could kick back on my Aquarius and pop champagne corks at passing jet-skis every time my account jumps up six figures, but I'd run out of bottles pretty quick. Gets boring after a while.  You see, I don't [i] need [/i] to be bustin' my ass this hard. Anything I could ever want is just a phone call away. At this point, the only reason to keep playin' is for the love of the game.  But hey, that's what works for me. You've got your whole life ahead of you kiddo, and you can waste it however you want. Get into professional street racing. Skydive off of Mount Chiliad. Hunt people for sport. F*ck it, play Arena War if you're some sort of psychopath!  Point is, you can do whatever. You. Want.  Just don't forget that there's a million other little rats like you.  [b] And they're [i] all [/i] hungry. [/b]",True

"After seeing this scene many times, I have realized that Lamar's roast is actually incredible. By acting as if he's in a hurry and talking quickly, he eliminates the opportunity for Franklin's counterargument, meaning that he can continue delivering his verbal critique.  The use of the phrase ""yee-yee"" is especially clever as it has very loose meanings and is utilized to further demean Franklin while not being necessarily rude, as well as fitting nicely into the rhythm of Lamar's ""smack-talk"" as the youth say. Since a person's hair is usually one of their most stand-out and noticeable features, by ridiculing his, Lamar makes Franklin's identity feel attacked and being shorter means that he's opened to the perspective of one taller than himself having to look down at it, making him especially self-conscious.  Furthermore, by berating Franklin's female partner, Lamar starts to get very personal with him which makes the insults even harsher, while also making Franklin feel inadequate in romantic relationships. As well as this, feigning uncertainty of her secret partner's occupation and referring to intelligent and respectable vocations such as ""lawyer"" and ""brain surgeon"" Lamar attacks Franklin's lack of a formal education.  Finally, the strange and belittling way that he calls him the funny n word further aims to make Franklin seems foolish and by slightly squatting to make eye contact, Lamar subtly roasts Franklin's stature again, as well as his status, making him feel like an insignificant child.  Truly, a genius in the art of ""roasting"" as the youth say.",True

"as someone who has played every single gta like every game from the gta franchise this game is good, the campaign is awesome online is good but the thing that really amazes me is the fact that u can change characters lol idk why this amazes me but its  really cool, graphics is also pretty good despite it being vanilla the physics is good but aint really as good as gta 4's  physics but its good enough and it wont really mark the game as down right unrealistic with the default physics so its decent. GTA 5 online is not really as good as the campaign for me becuz im not really interested in playing with other people but the missions and heists in online and the cars is awesome lol, and i dont really encounter that much modders anymore so i think rockstar is actually banning them now and actually doing something, if youre planning on modding the game please mod it on single player otherwise u will ruin other people's experience online.

"Interested in the story or modded multiplayer? Go for it!  If you're looking to get into GTA Online, save your sanity. Compared to a decade ago, it's in a horrid state. First off, you're no longer playing GTA when you're in multiplayer... you're playing a sci-fi version of Just Cause 3 on an unholy amount of steroids as you prevent World War 3 essentially. Additionally, everything's gotten far more expensive to encourage micro-transactions if you don't want to deal with the abysmal grind and there's even a subscription service now. The anti-cheat is utterly terrible... can't even join a single session without someone or several people using cheat scripts for the sole purpose of ruining everyone's day. No IP address protection, either. Only time the game gets a ""hotfix"" is to patch money exploits, anything else hardly ever gets touched.  TL;DR: Single-player is good, online is awful.",False

"""GTA V: The Loveable Old Grandpa Still Kickin' While We Wait for GTA 6""  Oh boy, where do I even start with this gem? GTA V is like that beloved old uncle who's been crashing on your couch for way too long—still stealing the spotlight, hogging the TV remote, and making you laugh despite overstaying its welcome.  Let's talk about the game. It's like the eternal loop of chaos and shenanigans. You've got Michael, Trevor, and Franklin—these dudes are like the dysfunctional family members you secretly wish were part of your squad in real life. Michael, the retired bank robber turned family man; Trevor, the dude you wouldn't want to be left alone with your snacks; and Franklin, the guy you'd trust to parallel park your car blindfolded.  The world of Los Santos is still more alive than my houseplants, and trust me, that says a lot. You can be a responsible citizen, driving obeying traffic lights... or you can hijack a blimp, fly over the city, and make a heartfelt speech to the seagulls. Your call.  But let's address the elephant in the room, or should I say the lack thereof? Hey, Rockstar, where's GTA 6? Did you misplace it under a pile of cash or something? We're here, twiddling our thumbs, waiting for the next big thing while you're probably brainstorming ways to make us rob casinos on Mars.  But back to GTA V—despite its age, it's holding up better than my attempts at adulting. The graphics might not be cutting edge anymore, but the storytelling? Still top-notch. The multiplayer? A haven for both chaos and camaraderie. And let's not forget the mods, because turning every car into a screaming flamingo or replacing the cops with angry chickens? Pure gold.  So, here we are, giving this game yet another thumbs-up while simultaneously side-eyeing Rockstar for keeping us in suspense about GTA 6. Come on, guys, spill the beans already! Until then, I'll be in Los Santos, probably doing yoga on top of a moving train or trying to make friends with a gang of wandering llamas.",True

Undoubtedly, it stands as the most prestigious game of the last decade, and I sincerely hope its successor will be at least half as impressive.

"I like how the other reviews sound like Wikipedia articles. Here's an actual review from an actual person. If you said that GTA V is the best game of all time, I wouldn't argue with you. What Rockstar did for gaming with this absolute masterpiece cannot be understated. We're still playing it religiously, 10 years after it came out. One decade. Let that sink in. The use of three protagonists was a great idea and really branched out this game in ways we've never seen before. Getting three different perspectives on the same story is extremely interesting. Each of the protagonists holds their own; Trevor is easily one of my favorite protagonists ever; I love the Al Pacino vibe that Michael gives off; and Franklin's journey is awesome to see. The gameplay is top-notch. I love the gunplay, and the driving is stellar; it's much better than the boat steering from GTA 4. The story is incredible; there isn't much of an emotional attachment, but it's still extremely compelling and can easily last for multiple playthroughs. I replay this game once a year because I love it so much. The map is one of the best out there, and there's a reason it's used when judging the maps of new games. Online is a completely different story; it's toxic and pay-to win. It's fun with friends, but random lobbies are awful. Overall, GTA V is a 5/5. There's really nothing that can bring down the score.",True

"""Grand Theft Auto V"" is the absolute kingpin of open-world gaming, and Rockstar Games has truly crafted a timeless epic that's still rocking it.  Los Santos is more than just a city; it's a sprawling playground where every neighborhood has its own story to tell. From the glitz of Vinewood to the streets of Grove, the attention to detail is mind-blowing, making every corner worth exploring.  The trio of main characters is a genius move. Michael, Franklin, and Trevor bring unique vibes to the story, and being able to switch between them seamlessly adds a layer of immersion that keeps things interesting.  The story itself is a wild ride of heists, twists, and Rockstar's trademark satire on society. The writing is sharp, the voice acting is spot-on, and the cinematic presentation gives the whole narrative a blockbuster feel.  And let's not forget GTA Online – it's a whole new world of criminal opportunities. Building your empire, pulling off heists with friends, or just causing chaos, there's always something to do. The regular updates keep the online experience feeling fresh and unpredictable.  The gameplay mechanics are top-notch. The driving feels responsive, the combat is satisfying, and the range of activities, from serious heists to absurd yoga sessions, adds that extra layer of GTA charm. The soundtrack is a mixtape of perfection that sets the mood just right.  Sure, the graphics show a bit of wear and tear considering the game's age, but the overall design and vibe of Los Santos still make it a visual treat.  In a nutshell, ""Grand Theft Auto V"" is a masterpiece of gaming. The massive world, memorable characters, and the freedom to dive into chaos or follow the story make it a must-play. Despite its years, the game's still got that magic touch, making it a timeless classic that stands tall in the gaming hall of fame.",True
its a good game to play with frinds but you cant play it  alone becuse it boring,True
"dis gem soo gud, yal mus try",True
"I really enjoyed Grand Theft Auto V on release, and I still really like the graphics, soundtrack, and the overall gameplay. I find that the driving in particular is very enjoyable, and I don't normally care about driving in games. The story is weak, and focuses heavily on a funding war between two government agencies despite it being obvious that the interactions between the three main characters are far more interesting.   However, over time, it has become harder to recommend. Rockstar is clearly making an absolute fortune from the online mode, and thus has focused all post-release development on this mode instead of doing any single-player DLCs. Unfortunately, the online mode is predatory in the same way that many mobile games are, and deliberately drags out the progression with long wait timers, big money grinds, and other artificial barriers designed to encourage players to buy in-game money with real currency to speed the process up.   Many features in the online game, such as the ability to insure custom cars and have them delivered to you, are exclusive to online play when they almost feel like basic features which should be present in single-player mode. A lot of content, including literally hundreds of cars and weapons, are exclusive to online play as well. Even worse - as this has gone on, the file size of the install has increased to match it (and you cannot install single player only) - it was around 50GB when I first got it, and now sits at 110GB. This game could be amazing to play offline, but Rockstar are fixated on herding players into their online mode in order to milk them for cash.",False

"The prices you've applied to Turkey seem like a joke. As a country, we didn't switch to the dollar; Steam switched to the dollar to keep prices stable in Turkey and prevent constant fluctuations. What you should have done was convert the price you applied to us into dollars. In other words, the price would have remained the same, and we would have purchased it in dollars. This was what Steam communicated to us. Despite knowing our low purchasing power, you would never make sales at these prices. You can't manipulate Turkish gamers in this way. Good luck.  Türkiye'ye uyguladığınız fiyatlar adeta bir şaka gibi. Ülke olarak, biz dolar sistemine geçmedik; Steam, Türkiye'de fiyatları sabit tutmak ve sürekli dalgalanmayı önlemek için dolara geçti. Yapmanız gereken şey, bize uyguladığınız fiyatı dolara çevirmekti. Yani fiyat aynı olacaktı, sadece dolar olarak satın alacaktık. Bu, Steam'in bize ilettiği bilgiydi. Düşük alım gücümüzü bilmenize rağmen, bu fiyatlarla asla satış yapmazsınız. Türk oyuncularını bu şekilde manipüle edemezsiniz. İyi şanslar.",False

"TLDR: Great game, worth it for $15.  -Graphics 8.2/10  -Story 8/10  -Freedom 9.6/10  -Capitalism 13/10  As always, it's GTA so of course it will be nearly perfect in the realm of RPG/Action/Adventure games. It's a huge AAA title, so it's going to have some bugs, even 10 years or more after release, but that doesn't detract from the perfection that is the GTA series. There's a reason it's one of the most well-known RPG games on the market.   I haven't experienced anything game breaking from playing it on Xbox 360, Xbox One, Series X and now PC. It's well worth it for $15 during the Autumn Steam Sale, but I don't see myself paying $30 or $50 for the game + DLC content/money shark cards. Just buy the ""premium"" edition for $15 and spend a day or two grinding in online mode if you want the $4m from the shark card, save that cash!",True

"Hello, viewers! This is my review of Rockstar Games' [i] Grand Theft Auto V [/i]!  [h1] Table of Contents [/h1] This is the order in which I will go over certain aspects of the game: [list] [*]Story [*]GTA Online [*]Modding Community [*]Final Thoughts [/list]  [h1] Story [/h1] The story of [i] GTA V [/i] is so masterfully crafted, I don't know where to start! The story from start to finish is AMAZING, much like [i] Grand Theft Auto 4's [/i] story. The only thing that makes [i] GTA V's [/i] story a tiny bit better is the fact that the story never really gets repetitive, which was my only gripe with [i] GTA 4's [/i] story. The fact that there's 3 main characters, all with different backstories and fully fleshed out is amazing as well!  [h3] Endings [/h3] In this sub-chapter, I'm going to discuss the endings of the games, so if you don't want spoilers, the rest will be blacked out using the spoilers feature. [spoiler] The 3 endings of the game are all meaningful in their own right. 2 of the 3 endings involving Franklin killing one of the 2 other main characters, Michael or Trevor. The third ending, being the Deathwish ending, sees Franklin save both Michael and Trevor from being killed. The Deathwish ending is personally my favorite ending, as it is the most action-packed ending of the entire game. [/spoiler]  [h1] GTA Online [/h1] [i] GTA Online [/i] on PC is very dangerous to play at the moment due to hackers and IP grabbers, however the console version (Xbox One, PS4, Xbox Series X|S and PS5) is really fun to play with friends. However public lobbies are not worth going into, because in my experience, getting griefed every 10 seconds by a level 1000 gets annoying after a while.  [h1] Modding Community [/h1] The modding community for PC is amazing. There's many fun mods out there to play, my favorite being [i] LSPDFR [/i] which is one of the most popular [i] Grand Theft Auto V [/i] mods of all time. There's another mod named [i] FiveM [/i] which is also popular amongst Twitch streamers. There's multiple ways to mod and manipulate the game and I suggest doing that once you've beat the story mode.  [h1] Final Thoughts [/h1] This game, in my humble and honest opinion, is the SECOND best [i] Grand Theft Auto [/i] game, the first being [i] Grand Theft Auto 4 [/i] (if that wasn't obvious already). However if I were to rate the game on a scale from 1/10, I'd give it a 8.5/10 (due to the Online mode being unplayable on PC and somewhat unpleasant on console). Anyways, if you enjoyed reading this lengthy review, please leave a like saying the review was helpful! Also I hope this review helped you make your decision on whether or not you wanted to buy this game!",True

"Rockstar likes to randomly disable accounts, accounts you may have spent actual money on, and then not respond to help queries. Literally CAN'T play this game now because it REQUIRES being logged in to their dumbass proprietary launcher (don't you LOVE those???) with an account connected to Steam. I can't log in, can't reset password, and if I try to just create a new account I am told there is already one associated with my Steam. Won't EVER buy a Rockstar game again. Fuck these devs.",False

"This is a little late but I can't believe how bad this game has become.   Everything's pay-to-play. Shark cards are expensive as hell despite the game originally costing like €50. Even if you have enough money to buy vehicles, you're not allowed to buy them until you fulfill some garbage prerequisite. This game is nothing but a money maker for Rockstar and it's just utter trash.   If you want to just have fun and not get killed by randos you have to play FiveM. Hackers are STILL a rampant issue but god forbid you get money from one cause you'll be punished for it. Trying to join up on friends online the game constantly errors out and kicks you back into single player or different server. While trying to run, if you happen to accidentally go too near to a mission or whatever, it'll take you into the mission without you wanting to and leaving it trying to get out of it kicks you out of the server sometimes.   Thanks for turning this game into absolute garbage, Rockstar. I've always loved the series but you have officially made this entirely unplayable.   GTA6 is going to look great and seem like a good idea but I know it's going to the same nonsense but more expensive. I hate this game with every fiber in my being.",False

"Story mode is great obviously, but online is a sh*t show. Cheaters in literally every single lobby, multiple cheaters, who will go out of their way to ruin your day, terrorize you until you're forced to leave. Cheaters will also disconnect you from online, crash your game, etc. There is almost no reason to grind for cash as you can just have some skank ass modder give you money, or you could just buy a mod menu. You literally cannot report people who are cheating, as the cheaters can intercept these reports and even see who filed a report and then subsequently crash your game. Screw R* for allowing this cheating epidemic to just run rampant. It just baffles me how R* can neglect such a large portion of their player base, what a sh*tty developer. Shame on you R*.",False

"Grand Theft Auto is a series of action-adventure games created by David Jones and Mike Dailly.[2] Later titles were developed under the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by British development house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by its American parent company, Rockstar Games. The name of the series is a term for motor vehicle theft in the United States.  Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can complete missions to progress an overall story, as well as engage in various side activities. Most of the gameplay revolves around driving and shooting, with occasional role-playing and stealth elements. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The games in the Grand Theft Auto series are set in fictional locales modelled after real-life cities, at various points in time from the early 1960s to the 2010s. The original game's map encompassed three cities—Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco),[a] and Vice City (based on Miami)—but later titles tend to focus on a single setting and expand upon the original three locales. Each game in the series centres on different respective protagonist who attempts to rise through the criminal underworld due to various motives, often accompanying themes of betrayal. Several film and music veterans have voiced characters in the games, including Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, William Fichtner, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda.[3]  DMA Design began the series in 1997, with the release of the Grand Theft Auto. As of 2020, the series consists of seven standalone titles and four expansion packs. The third main title, Grand Theft Auto III, released in 2001, is considered a landmark game, and brought the series into a three-dimensional environment for the first time. Subsequent titles have followed and built upon the format established by Grand Theft Auto III, receiving significant acclaim. The games influenced other open-world games, and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar titles.[4]  The series has been critically acclaimed, with all the main 3D entries in the franchise frequently ranked among the greatest and best-selling video games;[5] it has shipped more than 405 million units, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises. In 2006, Grand Theft Auto was featured in a list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum.[6] In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britain's most successful exports.[7] The series has also been controversial for its adult nature and violent themes, as well as for cut content.",True

"English:  Homemade Landjäger Sausage  Ingredients: - 500 g beef - 500 g pork - 20 g curing salt (nitrite curing salt) - 5 g coarse ground pepper - 5 g sweet paprika - 3 g garlic powder - 2 g ginger powder - 2 g dried marjoram - 1 g ground coriander - 1 g grated nutmeg - 1 g ground cardamom - Pork casings for stuffing - Kitchen twine  Instructions: 1. Cut the beef and pork into small pieces and pass them through a meat grinder with a coarse plate. 2. Place the ground meat in a large bowl and add all the spices (curing salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, ginger powder, marjoram, coriander, nutmeg, and cardamom). Mix well until the spices are evenly distributed. 3. Cover the meat mixture and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours to allow the flavors to develop. 4. Thoroughly clean the pork casings and soak them in cold water to soften. 5. Remove the meat mixture from the refrigerator and knead it again to ensure proper blending. 6. Stuff the meat mixture into the prepared pork casings, ensuring there are no air pockets and that the casings are evenly filled. 7. Cut the filled casings into approximately 10 cm long pieces and tie the ends with kitchen twine. 8. Hang the Landjäger sausages in a cool place to dry for about 2-3 weeks. The ideal temperature is around 15-18 degrees Celsius. 9. After the drying period, the Landjäger sausages are ready to be consumed. They can be enjoyed raw or lightly pan-fried.  Note: When making sausage, it is important to maintain proper hygiene. Ensure all utensils are thoroughly cleaned, and use fresh meat. It is also recommended to familiarize yourself with basic sausage-making principles and consider employing specific sausage-making techniques.    German:  Selbstgemachte Landjäger Wurst  Zutaten: - 500 g Rindfleisch - 500 g Schweinefleisch - 20 g Nitritpökelsalz - 5 g Pfeffer, grob gemahlen - 5 g Paprika, edelsüß - 3 g Knoblauchpulver - 2 g Ingwerpulver - 2 g Majoran, getrocknet - 1 g Koriander, gemahlen - 1 g Muskatnuss, gerieben - 1 g Kardamom, gemahlen - Schweinedärme zum Abfüllen - Küchengarn  Zubereitung: 1. Das Rind- und Schweinefleisch in kleine Stücke schneiden und anschließend durch den Fleischwolf mit grober Scheibe drehen. 2. Das gewolfte Fleisch in eine große Schüssel geben und alle Gewürze (Nitritpökelsalz, Pfeffer, Paprika, Knoblauchpulver, Ingwerpulver, Majoran, Koriander, Muskatnuss und Kardamom) hinzufügen. Gut vermengen, bis die Gewürze gleichmäßig verteilt sind. 3. Die Fleischmasse abgedeckt für mindestens 24 Stunden im Kühlschrank ruhen lassen, damit sich die Aromen entfalten können. 4. Die Schweinedärme gründlich reinigen und in kaltem Wasser einweichen, um sie geschmeidig zu machen. 5. Die Fleischmasse aus dem Kühlschrank nehmen und erneut gut durchkneten. 6. Nun den Fleischteig in die vorbereiteten Schweinedärme füllen. Dabei darauf achten, dass keine Luftblasen entstehen und der Darm gut gefüllt ist. 7. Die gefüllten Därme in etwa 10 cm lange Stücke schneiden und die Enden mit Küchengarn verschließen. 8. Die Landjäger für ca. 2-3 Wochen an einem kühlen Ort zum Trocknen aufhängen. Die ideale Temperatur liegt bei etwa 15-18 Grad Celsius. 9. Nach der Trocknungszeit sind die Landjäger bereit zum Verzehr. Sie können roh gegessen werden oder kurz in einer Pfanne gebraten werden.  Hinweis: Bei der Herstellung von Wurst ist es wichtig, auf hygienische Standards zu achten. Sämtliche Utensilien sollten gründlich gereinigt und das Fleisch frisch sein. Es empfiehlt sich außerdem, sich mit den Grundlagen der Wurstherstellung vertraut zu machen und gegebenenfalls auf spezielle Wurstherstellungstechniken zurückzugreifen.

"Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. Their appearance as a common plant was in the mid-Cretaceous period. There are 12,000 species now.[3]  A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. That is because they are wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, so they do not have to attract insects. Green is the best colour for photosynthesis.  Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant cover 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, except Greenland and Antarctica.[4]  Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants. They include the ""grass"" of the family Poaceae, which are called grass by ordinary people. This family is also called the Gramineae, and includes some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[5] These three families are not very closely related, though all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a similar life-style.  With about 780 genera and about 12,000 species,[3] the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family. Only the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae have more species.[6]  The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.  Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow tall, such as bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very arid or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such, but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.  Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[7] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion).",True

"Really disappointed with GTA V on PC in 2023. It started as a console port where all the design elements were still focused around controlling the game with a console controller. Eight years later, none of the problems caused by the console port have been fixed. There are also still extremely long loading times for every load screen no matter the PC's performance. On top of this, multiplayer is near impossible because of the number of people who are able to run scripts and cheats in multiplayer without penalty. As I said these have been issues since the game's release on PC but never fixed. Instead they keep pumping out more and more boring missions and game modes and ever more ridiculous vehicles and weapons to try sell the game to new players or so existing players will buy RP. It's evident this company is not interested in retaining players long-term, it's just a pump-and-dump strategy. I'm done.",False

"If you're thinking about picking this up to have some fun with GTA Online, DON'T. Get it for console, if you really have an itch to play. Online is currently next to unplayable for any normal gamer due to the rampant cheaters, which the community calls 'modders' for some stupid reason. What's worse is that Rockstar does next to nothing about it.   98% of the time you will run into a cheater in your server, or whatever game modes you like to play. The only question will be whether they just like to mess with server config stuff like making all NPC's aggressive, or making any nearby vehicles despawn, or more malicious stuff like insta killing you for no reason, teleporting you to an inescapable room, so they can kill you. One thing is for sure, even the good natured 'modders' will kill you if you try for an objective, or to do anything, really.  They use invincibility, fly around, can blow you up out of nowhere, pop the tires on your car repeatedly, spawn vehicles on top of you, bombard you with invisible semi trucks, send you to a menu that is only leavable by alt+f4'ing which tries to download god-knows-what.  I have not had a single session where I was able to just enjoy the game, get fair fights, or even have a chance to accomplish anything. If you do it is just by the good graces of the hackers that literally run the game, and most of the time they will ruin your experience just to be cancerous.   Also worth noting that almost all of my online achievements were forced on me by a hacker I upset, so he found all of the packages, movie probs, easter eggs etc on my account and instantly boosted me. Again... game ruined by hacking low-lifes that just want to ruin this game for people.   TLDR: Online is unplayable because Rockstar doesn't care about the PC community and let's cheaters run the game however they want. The cheaters main goal is to make the game entirely unplayable for any normal gamer (someone not using cheats).",False

"GTA 5 is an unparalleled open-world experience that has absorbed me for over 2000 hours. Rockstar Games has created a masterpiece that continues to captivate players with its expansive world, diverse gameplay, and engaging narrative.  The sheer scale of Los Santos is mind-boggling; every corner brims with life, from bustling city streets to the serene countryside. The attention to detail is impeccable, making exploration a constant delight. Whether engaging in high-speed chases, completing intricate heists, or simply soaking in the vibrant environment, there's always something new to discover.  The trio of protagonists adds depth and variety to the gameplay, each with their own distinct personality and storyline. The missions are diverse, offering a perfect balance of action, strategy, and adrenaline-pumping moments.  The multiplayer mode, GTA Online, is a world in itself. The ever-expanding content, ranging from heists to races and businesses, ensures that boredom is a foreign concept. The community aspect, coupled with the constant updates, makes for an evolving and dynamic online experience.  However, despite its brilliance, GTA 5 isn't without flaws. Occasionally, certain missions might feel repetitive, and the online experience can be affected by occasional glitches or connectivity issues. Yet, these minor setbacks are overshadowed by the game's overall brilliance.  After thousands of hours, GTA 5 remains a pinnacle of gaming excellence. Its immersive world, engaging gameplay, and limitless possibilities make it a timeless classic that continues to draw me back for more.",True

"In the grandiose tapestry of interactive entertainment, one gem gleams with a brilliance that transcends mere virtual escapades – Grand Theft Auto V, a magnum opus that encapsulates the epitome of digital storytelling and open-world immersion. This opulent masterpiece, birthed from the creative crucible of Rockstar Games, is nothing short of a symphony of pixels, orchestrating an exquisite ballet of chaos and consequence in the sprawling, sun-kissed canvas of Los Santos.  From the very moment one steps into the ethereal realm of GTA V, the senses are immediately ensnared by a sensory feast of visual grandeur. The opulent sunsets that bathe the cityscape in hues so vivid they seem painted by the celestial brushstrokes of a digital deity. The meticulous attention to detail, a testament to the virtuosity of the game's artisans, crafts a metropolis that breathes with a life uncannily mirroring reality.  Yet, it is not merely the aesthetic allure that propels GTA V into the echelons of gaming grandeur; it is the opulent tapestry of narrative finesse that truly sets it apart. The trio of protagonists, Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, form a trinity of diverse tales intricately interwoven, each narrative strand a sublime sonnet in the cacophonous ballad of crime and consequence. The dialogue, a linguistic ballet, is a marriage of wit and grit, a melange that elevates the narrative to operatic heights.  The open-world dynamism of GTA V is nothing short of a technological marvel, an expansive sandbox where every alley conceals a clandestine narrative and every street corner harbors the potential for mayhem. The vehicular symphony, a cacophony of roaring engines and screeching tires, becomes a visceral heartbeat pulsating through the veins of Los Santos.  Amidst this digitized ballet of chaos, the satirical genius of Rockstar Games unfurls like a velvet cloak of wit. The radio stations, an eclectic mosaic of musical genres and comedic satire, mirror the vibrant tapestry of Los Angeles, seamlessly blending the surreal with the uncomfortably familiar.  In the annals of gaming history, GTA V stands as an impenetrable colossus, a testament to the boundless potential of interactive storytelling. It is not merely a game; it is a transcendent experience, a symphony of chaos, consequence, and digital virtuosity that resonates with an indelible imprint upon the soul of the gaming connoisseur. Grand Theft Auto V is not just a title; it is a magnum opus, an opulent crown jewel in the diadem of interactive artistry.  Bad game.",True

"So, what to say? I LOVE THIS GAME, its like playing three games in one Game. First, there is GTA 5 online: You can chat with players and complete Heists, Missions and Robberies. You can play in an open World, big as two cities.  Then, there is Gta Story Mode. The varied Stories of the three different characters are breathtaking and adventurous. I have only got 38 hours in, but im excited to play more, as I am only at 19 percent. At last, there are different Events, like Haunted Halloween or In-Game-Events, like Junk-Energy Motorcycle Events. So you have like Racing, Shooting, Robbing, and multiplayer in just one game. I highly recommend this Game for people, who dont know where to spend their money next, and who cant decide on Ego-Shooter, Racing, and Action Heists or Robberies. So, feel free to buy it. THX",True

I have never played a game so completely infested with hackers as GTA. It is absolutely inexcusable for a game to be this popular and put such little effort into curbing the rampant hacking. I don't understand how they can continue to sell the product and shark cards while providing such a horrible user experience.  Do not play this game on PC unless you plan to play in a private lobby with just your friends. Do not listen to the people claiming you can just kill the hackers until they leave as they have multiple ways to hide who they are.   Play the game on console where they actually curb the cheating.,False

"I personally like the single player story, but online is just a wasteland. Everything takes 2000 years to grind for and it is just a time sink. And there are SO many microtransactions. Also RDR2 made me realized how overrated this game is. That game has a far better developed story imo and it does not get a fraction of the attention that GTA V does. GTA V is not bad by any means and this game was a milestone at the time it was made, but I still feel that this game gets far too much praise. I will likely finish the story campaign but that is about all I will likely do in this game. The reason I am giving this a negative review is because most of the content in this game is on GTA online and you already know my opinion on that. Feel free to disagree with me on all of this, but this game is just not for me. I am not saying the game is bad, but online needs to seriously be fixed with all of the hacking, excessive grinding, etc.",False

Review-wise, there's alotta cheaters/modders with mod menus but just go into passive mode or change server they won't bother you. Some modders will even help you out in heists or events so I can't complain. Dont take PVP seriously you won't gain anything from it. Take note, purchasing a car is GRINDY AF.   For reference.

"Absolutely abysmal/nonexistant customer service.   I cannot play my own, legally purchased game because I once was forced to sign up for the ""social club"" years ago on an email address that no longer exists. There is no customer service phone number (there is, but it's literally a recording to tell you to go through the website).   There is no live chat. You have to go through these categories to even let it let you contact customer support via email. They did finally respond to my request about a day and a half later, then asked me to confirm I wanted to proceed, and now it's been 2 more days and I still haven't heard back.   I just want to play a single player game. That I own. I don't want anything to do with any online anything with this game. I just wanted to run over some hookers in 4k on my day off.   This is the most cowardly customer service system I have ever seen.",False

"Honestly, it's a fun game. I find GTA Online enjoyable. I've spent enough time to rack up millions and still have fun without getting bored, friends are fun to have and coordinate heists with. don't want to deal with griefers? just go into invite-only, Do need money and a new car? complete Dax's story hell you even get a business that you can start with the money you make. I'm honestly skimming over so much but that's just because of how much content there is to do and see, it might get boring after being poor but do not for the love of god spend real money on this game besides buying it just watch Rags To Riches from TGG. I hope this helped you make an educated purchase on the GTA Online aspect.

"Love playing Grand Theft Auto games. especially Grand Theft Auto 5. This game is by far the best game I've actually played on PC yet. It runs on my ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 without any issues. The only problem I have with this game is that how overwhelmingly difficult the missions are. But overall, from a scale from 1/10.. I'll rate this game a 10/10.. This game has awesome graphics and is has very realistic game play than any other Grand Theft Auto game I played yet. This is such a improvement from Grand Theft Auto 4. Thank you Rockstar games for bring this game to the table and offering more fun ways to play. I recommend this game 100%.....",True

"this needs so much updating. needing more than two players for a heist or mission is ridiculous because it takes longer than 20 minutes to get random players to join which makes the game frustrating as fuck. when you do get matched, it's somebody hacking and killing teammates for no reason. thanks rockstar! you can suck my big fat hairy balls for that one. there's no option to choose a switch controller (really awesome when you can't figure out controls for flying), third person controls are beyond fucked up (trying to use a ladder? go fuck yourself), and taking away the cows was a massive punch in the dick.

Then the banned players can simply buy another account for like $10 US and do it all over again.

Like seriously they must share brain cells with a chimpanzee, the UX in this game is so ass. Why tf do I need to double-click every fucking button to confirm my selection? Are these devs retarded, like yes I clicked the fucking button just do the fucking thing... why tf do I need to use the arrow keys to select different options? why tf does it use a custom mouse pointer that's so fucking sluggish it's gay? WHY TF DID IT MAKE ME DO THE TRASH TUTORIAL BEFORE I COULD PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS AND IT DOESN'T LET YOU QUIT THE TUTORIAL AFTER STARTING IT?? REALLY??? And fuck me every time I want to quit a mission I have to go through 3 layers of dialog boxes... like nigga... just let me quit the fucking mission already... Controls are wack af, like really?... 'Q' is the default for hiding behind cover? what kind of retarded shit is that? Scroll opens up a goddamn wheel menu? what the cock?!? Walking/Sprinting feels weird, I don't know why, but somehow they managed to fuck that up. Driving is retarded, I briefly hit the spacebar and my car goes flying off like some turd in the wind. I could go on and on with all the retardisms in this game. I ended up uninstalling it after an hour and a half before I could discover any more. I just can't deal with its stupidity. If I knew they would set the bar as low as hiring complete RETARDS for the UX design I would've taken the job myself and done a better job goddamn. Hope whoever was UX lead for this game chokes on a walnut, and the hats off to the product owner for allowing this shit to go through. Enjoy my fucking $20 wasted you dumb hoes.",False

"Gta V is an amazing game. Excellent game to play with friends or family  However !!! -> Since day one peoples are cheating and still do on every online server there are alot of those players that use scripts & hacking tools and they don't get banned ( They use god mode, They can spawn random explosions around the map, teleporting into your car and out or teleporting you to places, they never get banned or kicked off the game, you can see them on every online session or a mission. they will ruin your missions and fun and cause you to get banned like they did to me and if ""you"" interrupt them in their stuff they just hack/mod your character to get banned.  So you can actually only play online in a closed session limited to so little content you can do but missions require most of the time 4 peoples so get your friends or don't enjoy any of that content or risk on getting banned.  It's not that the game is stable, it crashes every now and then to desktop when you try to do a mission or other activity than just roaming around doing the same things in the world.  So while going to lobby it pop you out of online mode sometimes you end in desktop for no reason, so let's accuse the lobbies :D but nope this is rockstar to be blamed for bad servicing...  Well logging in and out of sessions is taking like 2-4 min on a high speed broadband without using a proxy to improve connection issues... like what the hell this is not a dial up service ??? and eventualy you sometimes get an error message that you cannot join your friend or the session cannot be found. if you are lucky it just load forever - look at your screen for minutes and nothing happens. okey let's try again lol.  Well i'm not sad Rockstar is banning legit players, they already lost most of their playerbase. So i'm happy because they just save us a lot of time trying to play a broken game... It's hard to change bad habits of players and us the casual gamers - we are sick and tired of it.  Let's least hope GTA 6 does it different (Trailer in December)...  Rockstar i'm not blaming you but seriously after 10 years you could have made a change and done ""us"" players a better service and not this horrible mess!  It's a fact that there's hardly any mission running open on online sessions + all the spam messages coming in your ""HOME"" online service menu proves that YOU are the one that should be Frustrated and not US. So goodluck working on that and thanks for saving me time o/ see ya, probably not because All Decisions and Reviews are Final.",False

"A True Masterpiece, but Player Behavior Can Be a Challenge  Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  Grand Theft Auto V is nothing short of a gaming masterpiece. Rockstar has crafted an open-world experience like no other, with a sprawling, vibrant city to explore, an engaging story to follow, and endless opportunities for mayhem and adventure. The attention to detail and the sheer scale of the game world are truly remarkable.  However, the only downside I've encountered in my time with GTA V is the behavior of some players in the online mode. While the game itself is a work of art, the online community can sometimes be a bit challenging. You might encounter griefers, trolls, or hackers from time to time, which can be frustrating when you're trying to enjoy the game.  That being said, I don't think this issue should detract from the game's overall rating. It's more a reflection of the online gaming environment in general, rather than a fault of GTA V itself. Rockstar has implemented various measures to combat these issues, and there are many fantastic players and communities within the game as well.  If you can look past the occasional troublesome player and focus on the incredible content and experiences GTA V offers, you're in for an unforgettable gaming journey. Whether you're into the story mode or the vast online world, GTA V has something for everyone. It's a game that continues to stand the test of time, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an immersive, action-packed adventure.",True

"Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is nothing short of a modern gaming masterpiece. Released in 2013, it has continued to captivate players with its vast open world, immersive storyline, and an unprecedented level of detail that has set a benchmark for the industry.  The most striking aspect of GTA V is its sprawling, fictional city of Los Santos, a stunning and meticulously crafted representation of a modern metropolis. It's teeming with life, from the busy streets to the serene countryside, and you'll find yourself getting lost in the sheer size and detail of the game world. Whether it's a leisurely drive along the scenic coast, an adrenaline-pumping chase through downtown, or an unexpected encounter with the local wildlife in the wilderness, every moment in Los Santos feels like an adventure.  The game's narrative is equally compelling, with three distinct protagonists, Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, each offering a unique perspective and personality. The storytelling is top-notch, weaving a tale of crime, betrayal, and redemption, and it keeps you engaged from start to finish. The characters are well-developed, and the voice acting is superb, enhancing the overall experience.  GTA V's gameplay is a testament to Rockstar's commitment to excellence. It seamlessly blends action, exploration, and driving mechanics, offering a wide variety of activities, from heists to tennis matches, ensuring there's always something to do. The game's gunplay and driving mechanics are polished and satisfying, providing an enjoyable experience for both casual and hardcore gamers.  Moreover, GTA Online, the multiplayer component of the game, extends the fun beyond the single-player campaign. It allows you to explore Los Santos with friends, engage in various missions, or simply create chaos in the sandbox environment. The constant updates and additions have kept the online community engaged for years.  Graphically, GTA V was groundbreaking when it first came out, and it still holds up well today. The attention to detail in the world design, character models, and vehicle physics is outstanding. With the option to play in first-person view, you can immerse yourself even further into the world of Los Santos.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a timeless classic in the world of gaming. It's a game that's not just about entertainment; it's an experience. Even years after its release, it continues to attract new players and retains a dedicated fan base. If you haven't experienced the magic of Los Santos and the engaging narrative of GTA V, you're missing out on one of the most iconic and enjoyable gaming experiences of this generation. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the franchise, GTA V is a must-play title that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on you.",True
"""Grand Theft Auto: Where Mayhem Meets Satirical Brilliance""  Introduction: Ah, Grand Theft Auto (GTA), the virtual playground where chaos and satire hold hands, skip down the street, and then promptly steal a car. This iconic video game series has been a source of endless entertainment and controversy, offering players a morally questionable, yet undeniably captivating sandbox to explore. So, let's take a joyride through the twisted streets of GTA and examine what makes it a modern gaming legend.  Graphics: The graphics in GTA are so realistic that if you stare at the screen long enough, you'll start to wonder if you should pay rent for your in-game apartment. From the meticulously detailed urban landscapes to the awe-inspiring sunsets, GTA's graphics are so beautiful that even Mother Nature would be a little envious. Just don't be surprised if you end up admiring the virtual world more than your actual surroundings.  Gameplay: GTA's gameplay is like a bizarre mix of a circus act and a Choose Your Own Adventure novel. You can drive a tank through a shopping mall, steal a jet, or just cruise around listening to some funky radio tunes while evading the police. The game's open-world environment is a never-ending amusement park, where you're free to choose your own wild ride. It's like Disney World, except with more guns and fewer mouse ears.  Storyline: While GTA's narrative isn't exactly Shakespearean in its depth, it's like a cheesy B-movie script that you can't help but love. You play as a character who is almost always morally ambiguous, and you'll find yourself embroiled in various criminal activities that would make even Tony Montana blush. The plot twists are often about as subtle as a sledgehammer, but they are so over-the-top that you can't help but be entertained. It's a bit like watching a soap opera, but with more explosions and fewer evil twins.  Characters: GTA has given us some of the most memorable characters in the gaming world. From the lovable psychopath Trevor Phillips to the suave and stylish Nico Bellic, you'll encounter a cast of characters who are as diverse as they are entertaining. The game excels at creating antiheroes you can't help but root for, despite their many, many flaws. It's like a gathering of your weirdest, wildest, and most unhinged friends at a never-ending house party.  Satire: One of the defining features of GTA is its biting social commentary and satirical humor. The in-game radio stations and commercials offer a hilarious, exaggerated take on American culture, politics, and consumerism. It's like a Saturday Night Live skit on steroids, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all. GTA's satire doesn't just poke fun at society; it skewers it, roasts it, and serves it with a side of chaos.  Conclusion: Grand Theft Auto is not just a game; it's a cultural phenomenon. It's a virtual playground where you can unleash your inner anarchist, all while poking fun at the absurdities of the real world. Sure, it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're looking for an irreverent, action-packed, and often hilarious gaming experience, GTA is the ride you've been waiting for. Just remember to leave your moral compass at the door and your inhibitions in the real world. In GTA, anything goes, and that's precisely what makes it so outrageously, addictively fun.",True

"The cheating problem is completely out of hand to the point where I want a console just so I can play without someone ruining my game. It's obvious Rockstar doesn't care about PC GTA at all because any amount of effort would be an improvement over the current state of this game. Today I played for about 4 hours and got crashed or kicked on 14 different occasions, including 2 different times when I was selling special cargo, which resulted in almost 2 million GTA$ lost. I won't bother contacting Rockstar support again for reimbursement or reporting as they are completely clueless as to what their job is and copy-paste generic answers for every inquiry I've had with them over the past 8 or so years of playing GTA. The in-game report and vote-to-kick system is completely useless because the troublemakers are ALWAYS cheating, and they can just block reports and vote-kicks (not that they work in the first place.) The ratio of cheaters to normal players has to be somewhere around 1 in 4. On top of all this, the game very frequently refuses to load into Online the first, second, or maybe even third time, and I get infinite black screens or loading screens so often that even if I wasn't getting messed with constantly, I'd still have to reload the entire game about once an hour.  Now, onto the (intended) gameplay experience.  Earlier this year, Rockstar removed almost 200 vehicles from the in-game catalogue, under the guise of ""streamlining the shopping experience"" or some bullshit like that. On next-gen console, they added some sort of car club that you have to pay a monthly subscription for (yes, monthly) to get ONE free car a month and the mere opportunity to purchase some of those vehicles they took away for so-called simplicity. Of course, that hasn't been added to PC (because, again, Rockstar doesn't give a fuck about PC players) so our only option is to either cheat, which kind of ruins the game, or pray that in the next few years the car we want will finally pop up on the podium of the Diamond Casino AND we can somehow win it, or Simeon's dealership will at some point have it in stock.  Vehicle prices have also become outrageous. After modifications, I ended up paying almost 2 million dollars for some dogshit hatchback that doesn't even go fast in a straight line and doesn't turn without losing control. Most of the good affordable cars in the game of course got removed with Rockstar's cleansing efforts so unless you're willing to grind for hours upon hours for a single good car or cheat, you need to pay real money.  Shark cards are also priced the same as when they were released, and still give you the same amount of GTA$ as when they were released, which was way back in 2013. To put that in perspective, if you want the Oppressor Mk2, you'll need to shell out $100 for the bike alone. This doesn't include the price of the Nightclub AND Terrorbyte truck, the Terrorbyte vehicle workshop addon, and the price of all the modifications to the bike that make it worth using.  Solo grinding has become slightly easier over the past year or 2, especially with the addition to warehouse assistants that you pay to source things like cargo, but it's still a nightmare to make money solo, especially when you're first starting out. For things like special cargo and MC businesses, if you don't sell your stock while you have less, you'll be forced to make multiple trips in different delivery vehicles while the other ones play sitting duck and ping themselves on the map for everyone to destroy. Alternatively, you can hire associates or MC members, which sucks because as I said before, a majority of players cheat, and cheaters tend to entertain themselves with griefing. Or you'll hire someone that either leaves the session, destroys your cargo on purpose, or just doesn't help.  In short, my favorite game to absolutely fucking hate.",False

Rockstar is a laughably bad publisher. They have for some reason decided that PC isn't worth supporting and have made features that are only available to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Mainly the 4 million they give you at the start of the game and an explanation of all the newer content. Don't play this on PC if you have a console. It is far better there and isn't overrun with mod menus and DOSsing,False

"A great single player story.  I prefer GTA4's story, but not for lack of quality on GTA5.  Three protagonists were a pretty risky gamble on Rockstar's part, but it has a distinct immersion advantage over previous entries.  Trevor is right at home being the agent of chaos; feels great to rack up the wanted level as him.  Franklin embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of your typical early game and Michael acts as the unfulfilled have-it-all where all GTA protagonists end up (it's a lot like a player picking up an old save with a bunch of money, but no direction because most of the missions are done).  I had never really noticed how disjointed the main char of a GTA game was depending on my mood.  The heist structure took the best of the story missions of 4 and created fun variations of heists throughout.  Also, following a crew was a breath of fresh air in the franchise, even if in-crew relationships were not always golden throughout the story.  Weapons feel good and differentiate themselves from each other well.  Gunplay is the best it's been in the series.  Driving has the needle ever-so-slightly dialed back towards arcade-y from the weighty driving of GTA4; a good change, IMO.  Visuals have aged well.  The layout, size and diversity of San Andreas hasn't been matched in a game of this type since.  Tone is well-balanced between classic GTA absurdity, while not taking you out of the story at hand.  Money-making side content is ho-hum; par for the course.  I did enjoy the golf and tennis, which was a pleasant surprise.  I would not advise engaging meaningfully in online, even if you typically enjoy multiplayer.  It feels like it started as one big joke at the expense of pay-to-win ""modern gaming"" that became the most successful example of the same ever.  Convenient outcome for Rockstar stockholders, I'm sure.   It's a huge money sink and a quintessential griefer's paradise.  Don't pay for the privilege of being a puffer to some whale. </sermon>",True

"I tried to come back to GTA again in November 2023. Fresh character level 1. I played for a few hours. At some point I'm sitting in my car waiting for this magnificent game to put me in any job available. Hacker spawns beside me. Fools around for a mintue and then smashes a huge pile of action figures boosting my level from 5 -> 70.  Absoultely disgusting. I dont even blame him because he is obviously a special ed kid who thinks he is giving a charity by dropping 200k and 70 levels in the process.  Anyways, I will just calmly say the same thing I said to Poopstar in my RDR2 review. DIE YOU DISGUSTING INCAPABLE THIEVEING GOBLINS!

"Game wants to crash any chance it wants to especially on GTA online. if you want to do heist with friends then you'll probably have 6 out of 10 times of the game not loading the heist on all accounts, some accounts will load in but the host won't so instant reset or the assets on one account will not load and the heist will not be completed. A lot of the updates the game has mostly limit the amount of money a player can acquire in regards with the Cayo Perico heist. No bug fixes or adjustment with other heist to make players want to play everything else instead of doing the Cayo Perico heist which to date is the most efficient way to money in the game. everything else like business and bunker assignments has to be build up months in advance make a fraction of what you make in this heist. so  long story short i wouldn't,t want to recommend a game focused on making every update become more tedium then fun like it was years ago. but then again its a ten year old game and it seems all games are going this cringe direction of making more money instead of delivering a genuine fun experience to the consumer.",False

Kind of fun playing single player but online is run by cheaters who teleport onto you with godmode and just 1 shot you.   This game is like 10 years old so at this point its a game feature not a bug.  Unfortunately all DLC is for gta online only and not usable in story mode.  This optimizes the amount of money they can milk off you.  The story mode is easily worth the 20$ it cost but I wouldn't pay much more than that.,False

Hackers and MTX abound, the game doesn't respect your time, and the networking is god-awful. I mean, you want to fire it up and play a bit and it will make you wait. for. five. entire. minutes. just to load into a server. Once you're on it's mostly serviceable.

"Great concept terrible execution and exploitation of consumer. I've had the game for I don't know, a year or so. I've only been able to play it 50% of the time due to bugs and really long load times. Support really evasive. One-sided value system that benefits the company at the expense of consumer. For example, whatever the in-game currency is, people pay real money for that so in situations where a bug or crashed server cost you in-game money, one just loses that unless they're willing to submit to the evasive support program each time. However they are suspending, banning and etc,,, to yes customers for exploiting the third party mod-menus that may reward in-game money.  Let's just look at the subject of modders. I think it's safe to say all modders aren't alike. On one hand you have the griever who goes around heckling any and everybody. On the other hand you have the modder who became a modder to defend against the griever. lastly , the modder who only wants to experience his purchase in a re-imagined way that's not dictated by the game's producer. At any rate the producer should be concerned with what the consumer demand is not with a strict dictatorship of what they wanted the experience to be like. Let's keep it real. Software companies think total emersion is key, when in fact it isn't. All that is needed is just enough realism to fool the surface senses and then the fantasy. For example: Most people lives suck. They don't play video games to remind them how much their lives suck they play to escape. Each time Rockstar releases a version of GTA the public responds with they think the product should be instead of what is presented (mod-menus). Instead of Rockstar taking it as constructive criticism they look at it almost as if you stole or destroyed something. Remember modders are consumers too, and might arguably constitute the majority of Rockstar's clientele base. At the end of the day, it's not what you do but how you do it. Recently, my GTA V account was suspended and online character reset with no explanation. To treat a customer in such a way was shocking, so me knowing such companies live and die off the constant reinvestment of consumers I'm just bidding my time waiting for the release of CTA 6 and I'll pass. I'll pass on anything Rockstar. One for their hubris. Two for the disrespect of the money I invested into the company in comparison to what was gain in actual game play and time. And I'm sure I'm not the only one. I know this was written very poorly but it's early, I'm annoyed and really didn't want to have to write this in the first place, so please forgive my poor grammar.",False

Can't that be separated into a different install?   Rockstar, you've been milking this old game for over a decade now. Give it a rest, and give us a classic GTAV install to use if we just want to play single player. Make GTAO it's own thing. And where is GTA6 already.",False

"Don't get me wrong, the game itself can be fun. I have a good number of hours into it over the years. The single player was also quite good. Truthfully there are quite a few reasons to recommend or buy this game if you never have, but given the company behind it and the way they treat their patrons and players, handle their business, communicate things, etc I just can't recommend anyone support this. I firmly believe that we vote with our wallets, and the only way to really impact the bottom line of these greedy corporations is to not buy the shit they are selling if we don't like it. That's how we make them wake up, and that's how we get the changes we want. At the time of release, we didn't know what we know now. The game is what, nearly a decade old at this point? No new game, no real new content, just rehashed things for online. Egregious actions such as removing items from the game that people paid for, and removing the anti-cheat system to prevent it from being a cesspool in public online lobbies. These are just core things that you should not do, and yet, they do them. The price of things use to be somewhat reasonable, it was a nice balance of grind vs reward upon launch. Now, everything is so overpriced its not worth it to grind for, and this was done solely with the malicious intentions to force players to buy shark cards for real money to acquire in game items. The only thing we are missing at this point is a battle pass, then we really will be at the peak of modern games. Anyway, if you already own this game, by all means enjoy it. I implore you not to buy their shark cards, and if you don't already own this game, just pass on this. Save your money or take it elsewhere, preferably to a company/developer that doesn't choose to do the most despicable things at every turn.",False

I like how they handle the 3 protagonist swapping and their uses on the Story Missions.

Unfortunately, due to the fact that its developers FORCE you to use their garbage piece of crap launcher, I cannot recommend this game to anyone unless I tell them to just crack it. Buy it on steam for all I care and then crack it... but for your own sanity PLEASE DO NOT USE ROCKSTAR GAMES SOCIAL CLUB!!!! My account on the social club has been hacked 3 times and I'm not the only one. Many people have had this same issue and it seems that Rockstar could not be bothered about it. They take 3 weeks minimum to fix the issue (I have heard of people waiting months without a solution) and then you just have to hope that nobody targets your account to hack into it. Rockstar just sends you an email that says ""Your account email address has been updated. Emails will now be sent to h38es@fivesense.site instead.

"Grand Theft Auto 5, one of my favourite games ever. The best Grand Theft Auto game in my opinion. Overall great game, massive open world,  fun and great multiplayer and an amazing experience. Next-gen versions with first person mode switching and first person mode is so good, if you prefer that way of playing and so many options and settings to change to give you the ultimate GTA V experience in first or third person. This is just an absolute masterpiece the heists in online mode and story mode are so good. Very highly recommend buying this game the best GTA in the series it will never get old.

"if you like playing against others, then online is worth  myself? I don't like online and I do 100% games.... except this game is an absolute joke. Online, everything is extremely expensive so you will waste a lot of real life, just to afford things, after all, this is how they want to manipulate and make you ""out of your free will"" use the codes called bank details and purchases the shark rip off add ons, oh sorry, since it's legal rip off, it's called: Marketing  so anyway, because of the legal rip-off, called marketing, you will waste a lot of real-life hours playing this. After all, they did not introduce a lot of stuff in story mode, and you can only ever play with many such vehicles in story mode if you use 3rd party programs... of course, this means a risk of ban on your account.  so again, if you want 100%, avoid this game. And if you want to play with some of the vehicles, that are online exclusive, well, you sadly will not be able, to unless of course, you use 3rd party which is not allowed, after all, they are allowed to legally rip you off, make you spend hours and hours and hours, ""play"" this game, to encourage you to use real money to access stuff, but you using a 3rd party program is not allowed. oh and did I already mention? whoever makes the requirements for the achievements are trolls. That person/s most likely never did the achievements themself or have a gruge against people who love doing 100%. Just look at the requirements. including maps that show you collectables on a map, just for an idea.",False

"I dont know why I keep coming back to GTA every once in a while, I think its the updates thinking maybe the game is better.  Every time I play for multiple hours I just feel dead after playing.  I think it all starts from wanting to go to the strip club, have sex in a car, and it turns into doing random things and shooting.    Some of the multiplayer stunt missions have been absolutely hilarious fun, but GTA does have a terrible way of setting up or gathering players for a game, that ends up having everyone leaving.  Remember when the game first came out and there is absolute huge hype.  I've already heard rumors of GTA 6 coming and literally youtube videos saying the rapture is going to happen when the game is out, that its going to be super photo realistic and everyone is going to be playing the game.  Jesus coming back to take us, really all we want is peace and love.  I need a relationship with Jesus and to go be with him in heaven one day, I need to pray and read the bible.  I just feel dead after playing and time wasted.  At least after 8 hours constantly playing all day, you can get closer to the end point of quitting than if you played casually for years.",False

"The game itself? Great, it's GTA, what did you expect. However... I can't even play it anymore.  I bought this game waaay back, but never had the time to complete it. Now that I finally could, I installed it and tried to log back into my old Rockstar account... only to discover that it got broken into and even email changed without any notification on my old email address... Now I can't log in, can't play and can't even register a new account as this email address which I've never seen is now locked onto my steam account. Great job Rockstar... make your own, useless launcher and than don't protect it properly from hackers. It's a joke... you're a joke.  I opened a customer support ticket, but I'll be sure not to buy anything from Rockstar ever again. Great job protecting our accounts and data!",False

"GTA Online is very fun if you have friends. The grinding in this game is on one hand very satisfying because you see some progress made if you choose the right businesses. But on the other hand it can be very boring and frustrating if you get the same missions on a row or do the same business multiple times.  The missions and rewards overall became better from update to update. New content is being released regularly. While some of these updates are quite horrible (why tf do you remove most of the cars from the sites where you can buy them?), most of them give you a few hours of fun. Replayability is not guaranteed though.  Thumbs up, because its fun.",True

"This game, really cannot be well described in a review, but i'll try my best.   The Single-Player and Story are very good, lots of activities, quite a sizeable amount of overall variety interms of vehicles, weapons, businesses. However, for those coming from GTA IV, this is a more ""light"" sided story, rather than the grim from the GTA IV, so don't expect another emotional ride about how war is horrible and it screws people over.  This is more of a cynical reality of what USA is, and wants to be, dumb fun simply said.   Now, the Online section(which is controversial for many).  The Online pretty much is a whole seperate game, and i'd treat it as a MMORPG Sandbox than a open world, this is one of it's biggest flaws and upsides. For those that like to grind their games, this is one of the best mixed genres if you ask me, there is content suited for most likely anyone.   Concluding this whole jumbo-mumbo, buy it, you will definitely get your value from this game(especially on sale, 14 euros?!)",True

Overall a good game but i am really pissed of right know and i can fuck anyone from rockstar. They are a million dollar game maker and they don't even care about players. The game take to long to open and in the game it has to connect with the rockstar server for online playing.. And the launcher fail most of the time. In the game when i am in a friend's session it automatically kick all players and i had to complete my fucking mission again. And i am not even talking about those fucking mission icons in online map.. They sucks everytime.. And the game is full with hackers and when my teammate drive in missions it seems the car is teleporting because of lag issues..

"Mostly Positive. I didn't like the main story because I don't relate with psychopaths so I didn't finish it. But, there is enough to do in the online game for PVE with some friends in a closed session. I generally avoided PVP since there are too many hackers that have ruined open sessions. You can solo play most of the online game in a closed session and I tried that for a while but ultimately got bored quickly. If you buy a military vehicle, you generally can't use it in the heists (except the setup missions), but you can use them for cargo, nightclub and moto-club. The humor in newer updates (such as drug wars) has become more crass/annoying and less tongue-in-cheek. They still haven't fixed the slow player controls after all these years. The only reason I have so many hours in the game is because there was a time when I could go AFK while the nightclub accumulated, but they changed that. I recommend buying this on sale if you're looking for something different to play, but don't expect too much. Once you get to the endgame, there's nothing to do other than collect expensive useless vehicles. Don't hesitate to move on to a different game at that point.",True

"Ah, Grand Theft Auto V, the game that proves crime can be a family affair! From the moment I first stepped into Los Santos, I knew I was in for one wild ride. You see, this game has it all - action, mayhem, and a touch of good ol' family drama.  The city itself is stunning, and it's like a virtual playground for chaos. I mean, I've stolen planes, jumped out of helicopters, and even robbed a few stores with my pals Franklin and Trevor. It's like a never-ending vacation, except with more gunfights and fewer piña coladas.  Franklin is the man when it comes to driving. He's got a need for speed that's just as crazy as mine, but with fewer traffic accidents. Trevor, on the other hand, is well... let's just say he's a unique character. He's the kind of guy you don't want to cross, but he's also the kind of guy you can't help but laugh at. His explosive personality matches the explosive action in the game.  And don't get me started on the missions! From heists to drug deals gone wrong, it's like a never-ending rollercoaster of adrenaline. There's something truly satisfying about pulling off a perfectly executed heist, and then escaping from the cops like a bunch of pros.  But it's not all about crime. You can play tennis, go for a round of golf, or just chill out by the beach. Los Santos is the perfect place for a getaway, as long as you don't mind the occasional gang shootout or police chase.  In a nutshell, GTA V is like a Hollywood blockbuster that you get to star in. So grab your virtual sunglasses, hop in a stolen car, and get ready for a wild ride. Just remember, crime doesn't pay...unless you're playing this game!",True

"Its a thumbs up...  NB. I don't touch online, never will.  Characters are great, the story is nice enough, the heists make the missions a bit more meaningful and connected, the radio is interesting/funny and has some good atmospheric tracks, the open world is really nicely done.  I bought this game twice on Xbox but never finished it because first one disc got trashed, then when I got a second my xbox was trashed. So I picked this up in a sale on pc to finally finish it.  The bad points: - The open world is great, but,.... often meaningless. This was a criticism of mine for San Andreas (albeit one of the greatest games of all time). You can go somewhere and it looks nice, but is there any purpose, or meaning? If you want to shoot beachgoers yes but not a lot else. It reminded me of Fallout IV, where you can build a base with a pool table, but why, when no one interact with you? - They really need to put manual gearchanges in to their next GTA. I know lots of US vehicles are auto but the driving is boring, in that there is no satisfaction of dropping a gear to get up a hill or overtake. - the speed is restricted/unrealistic: watching the speedometer I think it goes up to 100mph for pretty much all cars,.. really, a Ferrari or whatever doing 100mph max? You should be able to push it to 155,... and be punished for doing so by wrapping yourself around a tree. It makes driving (half the game really) quite timid) - Most missions are still just drive,... bang,...shoot,...drive..... crash,... drive,... finish. Look I know it is 'GTA', but still, the missions are quite repetitive and feel quite dumb in the great environment that there is - Controls when walking are awkward. I think this is much better in RDR2, hopefully it will be for any future GTA because the number of missions I messed up because the controls are clanky is huge. I never finished GTA IV because the controls were clanky (and I got sick of being called for dates to go bowling etc.) - all the money houses, businesses, side games don't seem to matter as you can finish tthe story quite early. After the first couple of missions I never went to an Ammunation again... I tried to use the stock market but didn't have enough to invest, then when I did, it was pretty much the end of the game. The golf and tennis is nice, but after a while you think what is the point, might as well get a golf or tennis game! And I totally forgot until now there was hunting. - They spent WAY too much time on doing the whole strip club thing, - Collectables were a bit meh, the whole underwater thing, way too time consuming compared to tagging in San Andreas which was fun.  So many criticisms yet still a thumbs up?  Because if you play through the story, just have a laugh, it is great fun and recommended and ultimately I am glad I played it. I think years ago the side elements of GTA were as good as even full games, but now GTA feels a bit of a jack of all trades, master of none; refining the driving and nicely fluid foot/combat controls in future might help.  Love the characters though just wish there had been twice the story.",True

"Online is dead.  Speaking from a strictly online perspective there is no reason to play the game.

GTA online is clearly set in a free-for-all war-torn version of the US where nobody cares about anything other then money (A bit like Rockstar themselves). This is possibly where the inspiration came from as the game developers don't seem to care about anything as long as the game continues to make them money. Who cares if people mod, scam or cheat, it doesn't matter, its profitable.  If all that sounds like a good time, then this is the game for you!",False

"A heavily pregnant Rarity modeling some maternity outfits for Older!Spike in a private little fashion show. Rarity is pregnant with septuplets, and she’s showing off her ten-month-pregnant body for Spike, who is the father. Spike is looking on with great interest, leaning back and leisurely jerking off while he enjoys the show. Before he can cum, Rarity climbs down and mounts him cowgirl, letting him orgasm inside her. Spike has a ridged dick with a tapered point, along with a thick, bulbous knot at the end. Rarity is modeling a navy and violet dress with a silver hem.Rarity is pregnant again, this time with twelve foals. The compatibility and fertility of dragons and ponies is no longer in question, and the effects of which have been having an interesting effect on Rarity’s body. Dragon magic has started to intermingle with her own, bonding her to Spike and allowing him to be of equal size to mate with him no matter how big he grows. Which is good, because Spike has started growing more and more as days past, the power of the Elements starting to affect him as well. Now with both of them growing larger by the day with no sign of stopping, they have one last romp on their old bed before they both outgrow it.A few years have passed. Rarity and Spike have continued to grow bigger and stronger, continuing to have more children as the Elements of Harmony infuse them with divine power. Here, Rarity is once more ten months pregnant with more foals than ever, but even as a giant in a state of advanced hyper pregnancy, she still like to go hunting for gems. Spike still helps with her gem hunting endeavors, mostly to make sure she’s safe, but also as a bonding activity.   However, being alone in such a beautiful and nostalgic place often leads to them feeling frisky… although considering their sex drives these days, they’re pretty much always frisky.It was now clear destiny had something in mind for Spike and Rarity. The combination of the Elements and ancient dragon magic couldn’t be ‘blamed’ for their continually growing magic, size, and fecundity. Even their consciousnesses had begun to expand to new and greater heights, leaving many to speculate they were ascending into gods. Spike and Rarity didn’t know themselves, but the new abilities they discovered and demonstrated allowed them to not only provide for their growing family, but expand it even more.   Here, Rarity is implementing a new form of magic allowing her to be impregnated while already pregnant. In moments, her packed-full womb will be swelling even bigger with freshly-conceived lives; all rapidly gestating to catch up with their ‘older’ siblings. Spike’s orgasms are copious, but she won’t be wasting a drop of his thick, virile seed–it’s all going inside for maximum results.   Spike, who’d intended to watch the process, can hardly contain himself. He can sense the spell working, and is now about two seconds from plunging back inside Rarity and knocking her up even more. His massive nuts are filled to the brim and aching, his cock is harder than ever, and he fully intends to knot her and pump her full; first doubling the baby count… then quadrupling… then octupling…Spike and Rarity, now ascended into gods, are in the midst of creating new planets to raise their ever-growing family. Spike does the “heavy lifting” of the process, meaning the creation of the planet core and mantle, the planet’s crust and mountain ranges, the oceans, etc. Dragon magic is primal and more closely attuned to the building blocks of reality, so this task is easier for him. Once he’s done, Rarity comes in and does the “finer details” such as the atmosphere and weather, the flora and ecosystems, and more. Rarity can’t help but admire Spike as he works. He certainly does make for an impressive and powerful figure, and he only becomes more so with time. Perhaps Spike doesn’t realize he’s accidentally putting on a show for her, but then again, perhaps he does. It certainly wouldn’t be the first time they’d shown off to each other… like when Rarity had shown him a new maternity dress, oh so very long ago. As a dragon god, Spike is rather proud of his achievements and knows Rarity loves him with all her heart. He definitely intends to keep her close to his side for the rest of eternity, immortalizing her within his very domain… because of the children they created.  About ten years have passed since they’ve created the universe. Both Spike and Rarity have had their fair share of friskiness, impregnating more magical beings while their magic ages them even more. Spike is usually impregnated while wearing a more elaborate outfit, such as his extremely long leather skirt and hot pink pussycat sweater combo. Rarity still enjoys using sex as a way to infuse more magical life into her body, which is clearly evident when Spike’s enormous, thick, giant cock thrusts inside her while she wears her light brown, frilly robe. For these ten years, Spike’s sex life has been non-stop, with his lust for Rarity never having been quenched…or at least the lust was somewhat used up, until now.  It’s been months since Spike’s semen made its way into Rarity’s womb, but the magic is still able to grow new baby flesh in both of their wombs. The two of them are still quite young, only three or four years on the grand scale, so the magic of children is not necessary. But the magical still allows Spike’s enormous cock to expand and grow more fully, and once again Spike’s teeth and beard are not long enough to enclose his mouth and give him full control of his breathing. Rarity, though, has grown into an even more beautiful and charming woman. Her hair is more lustrous than ever, and has been magically tamed so it follows her, dancing on top of her head in an endlessly fascinating pattern, each lock shimmering like diamond dust. Rarity’s eyes are still silver and sharp, although they’re a little more round than they used to be. She’s gained a few less pigtails over the years, as well.  Spike is still in a lustful, permanent “man-lust” state, since Rarity’s womb produces impregnable offspring.        i saw this from someone else so i copy their homework and made this using ai",True

(talking about online) played 144 hours and its a really fun game but the only thing to do when you have everything is just to get mods or grief so i recommend it for your spare time as its a pretty long game and story mode is good too but online is just better in my opinion but overall loved it,True
i would differently recommend this game its awesome.,True
All time best game for me,True
"So, the story mode in this game? It's a real joy. You can just cruise around, have fun, and get lost in the game world. But let's talk about the online mode, where things take a frustrating turn due to those pesky modders.  Trying to get a simple Heist prep done becomes an ordeal when modders are lurking around. They can blow you up or take you out as soon as you're about to reach your destination. It feels like they're everywhere, on almost every server. Even if you try to report them, it's often futile because they can crash your game and erase any trace of your report from Rockstar's system, leaving them scot-free.  These modders aren't just satisfied with ruining gameplay; they also spam the in-game chat with ads, making it beyond annoying. What's worse, their activities can make the servers lag due to the sheer volume of their antics. Today, I ran into a modder who, at first, seemed like a savior by freeing me from a submarine another modder had trapped me in. But then, they turned the tables by making my character no-clip, sending me soaring into the sky, and then plummeting me to my death. They also teleported me away from my destination just when I was about to reach it. All in all, the online experience on these servers is nothing short of a disaster.  To sum it up, while the story mode is all fun and games, the online mode is marred by these modders who take the fun out of it and create a pretty frustrating environment for players.",False

And though i still have an unexplainable fondness of the game. I seriously cant stomach how unplayable every session has become. Plagued with the same issues repeating themselves, everytime you load up the game. From the horribly laced servers, terrible game stability/crashes, Horrible framerate/peformance drops, Graphical Glitches, and last but not least, getting stuck in a fucking loading screen. And even if you manage to fight through all that, with you sanity left. Then comes the Recycled content/Removal Of Beloved Content, Uninspiring Updates, Constant Phone Calls, and last but not least, modders.  I really love this game. But it definetly has much to come back for, and so much enjoyability. But with all the issues stated above, its simply impossibly for me to have fun playing this game. I just feel iritated.

"HEY! I KNOW YOUR KINDA HUNGRY BUT DO I GOT A GOOD TAMALES GUIDE FOR YOU!  step by step so you cant miss it  INGREDIENTS FOR THE FILLING: 1 pound boneless pork shoulder 1/2 large white onion 2 cloves garlic, divided 1 bay leaf 1 pound tomatillos 4 serrano peppers 1 tablespoon canola oil 1 tablespoon kosher salt, plus more for seasoning 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more for seasoning  FOR THE DOUGH: 1 large package dried corn husks (about 1 pound) 2 pounds fresh masa for tamales (purchased from a tortillería; not masa preparada), or 3 cups masa harina for tamales 1/2 to 3 cups salted chicken broth (not low-sodium) 1 1/4 cups canola oil 2 teaspoons kosher salt 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder  EQUIPMENT: Steamer pot Large pot or bowl Medium saucepan Stand mixer or electric hand mixer Tongs Blender Strainer Slotted spoon Chef’s knife or paring knife, and cutting board Measuring cups and spoons  INSTRUCTIONS STEP 1: Soak the corn husks. Place 1 package corn husks in a large pot or bowl and add enough hot tap water to cover. Make sure the husks are submerged by weighing them down with a few coffee mugs.  STEP 2: Cook the pork. Cut 1 pound pork shoulder into 2-inch chunks. Season with kosher salt and black pepper. Place in a large saucepan. Cut 1/2 large white onion into 2 pieces, and add 1 piece to the pan. Add 1 of the garlic cloves, 1 bay leaf, and 2 1/2 cups water. Bring to a simmer over high heat, about 7 minutes. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until the pork is fork tender and falling apart, stirring every 20 minutes to prevent the bottom of the pot from burning, 1 to 1 1/2 hours total. Meanwhile, start the chile sauce.  STEP 3: Cook the chile sauce ingredients. Husk and rinse 1 pound tomatillos. Place in a medium saucepan. Add the remaining onion piece, remaining garlic clove, and 4 serrano peppers, and cover with 1 inch of cold water. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to medium. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the items have softened, about 8 minutes for the tomatillos and peppers, and 12 minutes for the onion and garlic. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the items to a bowl as they are ready. Let cool slightly, then coarsely chop the peppers (discarding any tough stems), onion, and garlic.  STEP 4: Cool the meat. When the pork is ready, use a slotted spoon and transfer it to a bowl. Remove 1/4 cup of the broth for the sauce. Let the pork cool slightly, then shred with your fingers or two forks.  STEP 5: Blend the sauce. Place the tomatillos, chopped chiles, onion, garlic, and 1/4 cup broth in a blender and blend until smooth.  STEP 6: Combine the sauce and meat. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a medium saucepan over high heat until shimmering. Add the sauce in one quick pour. Stir in the shredded pork. Add 1 tablespoon kosher salt, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a boil and cook for 3 to 4 minutes to let the flavors meld. The filling should taste salty—it needs to be saltier than you’d think, to stand out inside the tamales. Remove from the heat and set aside.  STEP 7: Knead the dough. If using masa harina for your dough, place 3 cups masa harina in a deep mixing bowl and pour in 2 1/4 cups chicken broth. Mix with your hands until the dough is moist and soft. If using fresh masa, knead 1/2 cup chicken broth into 2 pounds masa with your hands until a firm dough forms.  STEP 8: Mix the dough. Pour 1 1/4 cups canola oil into a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Alternatively, use an electric hand mixer and large bowl.) With the mixer on low speed — and don’t wear your best clothing, because it will splatter — add the masa in golf-ball-sized pieces one at a time. The dough may look rather lumpy and unattractive here, but it will eventually transform. Stop the mixer and sprinkle in 2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder. If using masa harina, stir in an extra 1/2 cup chicken broth. Mix on high speed until the dough is very light and fluffy, about 10 minutes more.  STEP 9: Spread the dough inside the husks. Remove 1 corn husk from the water and wipe off any extra water with a towel. Use a rubber spatula to spread about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of dough (the amount depends on the size of the corn husk) in a large rectangle. Leave a few inches of space at the top so the dough doesn’t burst out once it’s cooking, and leave about 3 inches of space at the narrower end of the leaf so you have room to fold it.  STEP 10: Add the homemade filling. Add a small amount of the pork filling (about 2 tablespoons) in a line down the center of the tamal. Don’t add too much, or else it will spill out of the husk when you’re folding it.  STEP 11: Fold the tamales closed. To close the tamale, bring one side of the tamal toward the other, like an empanada or a taco, and press lightly to seal. Then tuck the leaves of the husk over each other into a tube-shape. Press down on the narrower end to seal, then fold up toward the wider end. Set aside folded side down and repeat with the remaining tamales.  STEP 12: Steam the tamales for 35 minutes. Add water to a steamer pot and line the insert with a layer of corn husks. (This helps keep the steam trapped inside and adds a bit of flavor.) Bring the water to a light boil. Place the tamales vertically, open-side up in the steamer, but don’t pack them too tightly or they won’t have room to expand. Cover with some extra corn husks. Cover and steam until the corn husk easily pulls away from the tamal, about 35 minutes.  STEP 13: Let the tamales cool 10 to 15 minutes. Don’t eat the tamales immediately after you remove them from the pot, as they’ll be too soft still. Let the tamales cool for 10 to 15 minutes — they’ll firm up quite a bit and be ready to eat.  AND THERE YOU GO ENJOY!",True

"GTA 5 is brilliant, i love it too bits and everything about the game is perfect... almost. you see even though i am leaving a positive review on this game due to how great it actually is, there is an issue. One single issue that makes the game a little worse than it can be. The cop system in this game isn't great. There is no real way of putting it but it really does kinda suck just a little bit in my opinion. At the time of writing this i have roughly around 20 hours of game play and i think i can say with all honesty that the cops in this game are not the best. it makes a game about committing crimes no longer really feel like it as you constantly have  to worry about the whole system. I think the star system is great, it makes sense and it's easy to understand but just because of how the cops are in this game, it makes it feel more like just an annoyance. please don't take this as a `don't buy this game` kind of review. the game is terrific and i really mean that, it's nearly perfect. i just think the cops could be worked on a little bit and thinking about how a game based around crime can be so easily shadowed upon by the police system within the game. Really do buy the game anyway. It is outstanding, just good it really is but be warned about how the police works in this game, Its very... different to say it lightly.",True
"Great game. Been years of unyielding fun. not recommended for anyone under 25 but definitely no one under 18 should be playing this. very violent, a ton of sex and drug references, characters break pretty much every law you can think of short of hurting children, as well as the most foul language in any game. If you're looking for a way to live a virtual criminal double life free of any consequences, this is the game for you.",True

It's GTA V... This game speaks for itself. Online is a love hate thing. It's 2023 and they have made changes that really amplify money making and you can eliminate any and all threats from the toxic community by just having your own friend sessions where you can manage your businesses without issues. To me that's been the biggest and best change made to this decade old masterpiece. All I've ever wanted was piece and quiet when doing my business missions. Thanks to that change my empire cranks out money left and right.,True

"A wonderful game, full of endless things to do and it's really hard to get bored if you keep an open mind. I personally love the game modes, Arena was one of the best updates to ever come out for a video game, even if it was a massive investment with little return.   Unfortunately, no amount of role playing or amazing updates could ever rid the modders, no amount of vast cash cards could save us. For modders, they always win, children can mod, they don't die, they have infinite money. I don't see how they can play longer than 5 minutes and get bored, but, every lobby has at least one, usually 5.  The only saving hope is that the first 6 months of GTA6 will be clear of modders, maybe it can feel like a real game again without being bombed into San Andres just for saying a modder had a flare up of tiny pp syndrome.",False

"I had a lot of fun initially until I realized that the only thing worth doing are the main missions. The driving and combat feel great.  The game is full of side activities that I didn't find worth doing after a while. I miss the gang wars and dynamism that older games like GTA San Andreas had. It kind of feels like there's nothing to do outside of the main story which is a shame considering the size and scope of the game. Even when I bought new properties, it kind of felt pointless and underwhelming. They also seem to tease a heist system that I never could engage with outside of the main missions.

"The base game it's alright, the story will take you around 20 hours to complete including all the side missions, after that all you have left to do is busy work, collect 50 of those collect 50 of that, find 100 of these, the game itself is replayable to a certain exten but the outcomes are not that different from each other.  What gains it the negative review for me is the online part of the game, every single little thing is designed to make you want to buy shark cards, every part of the gameplay is walled behind millions of ""dollars"" that you'll have to spend hundreds of hours gathering by playing the same mission 100 times or buying a shark card, the public lobbies are a s***show, the game has been abbandoned in that aspect, the publisher and developers gave up on that a long time ago, modders and account sellers rule the online aspect of the game, the things that you can do by yourself are very limited and if you want to do all of it it's virtually impossible because everyone is either out there godmode griefing low levels or running the same 2 missions over and over to save enough money to buy a specific car or whatever else.",False

There's so many options to pick from. It's also great with friends! But the only downside is the hackers. I logged in one day and this guy had put a boat, a plane and a lot of random crap in my home garage. I was annoyed at first. But looking back on it, it was pretty funny.",True

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is the quintessential open-world game, and even years after its initial release, it stands as a testament to the sheer brilliance of Rockstar Games. The game's arrival on Steam marks an opportunity for gamers old and new to immerse themselves in the sprawling, chaotic, and endlessly captivating world of Los Santos.  Set in the fictional state of San Andreas, GTA V tells the intertwining tales of three complex characters: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking a life of luxury; Franklin, a skilled repo man eager to escape the streets; and Trevor, a maniacal force of nature with an insatiable appetite for chaos. The storytelling is nothing short of cinematic, drawing players into a world of high-stakes heists, betrayals, and a satirical take on modern American culture.  The first thing that hits you when you enter Los Santos is the sheer scope of the world. The city is a living, breathing entity, with its inhabitants going about their daily lives, contributing to the feeling that you're part of something much larger. The attention to detail is staggering, from the sparkling skyscrapers to the gritty, crime-infested neighborhoods. The game world is a playground that oozes authenticity.  GTA V is not just about the story; it's about the freedom it offers. You can jump into countless side activities, from racing and sports to skydiving and base-jumping. The world is your oyster, and the depth of content is astounding. The heists, in particular, are standout moments that showcase the game's strategic depth and cinematic flair.  Gameplay is a perfect blend of shooting, driving, and general mayhem. The controls are tight, and the variety of vehicles at your disposal makes exploration enjoyable. The shooting mechanics are top-notch, and the cover system is a godsend during intense gunfights. Whether you're evading the police, chasing down criminals, or just cruising through the city, the gameplay is endlessly engaging.  Online multiplayer is where GTA V truly shines. GTA Online takes everything great about the single-player experience and lets you share it with friends or compete against other players in a massive, ever-evolving world. From heists to races, free roam activities, and ambitious player-created content, GTA Online provides a seemingly limitless array of experiences, all while allowing you to build your criminal empire.  Visually, GTA V still impresses, even years after its release. The PC version on Steam offers the best graphics, with support for high resolutions, detailed textures, and customizable settings that make the game look even more breathtaking. The attention to detail extends to the dynamic weather and day-night cycle, which contribute to the immersive experience.  While GTA V is a masterpiece, it's not without its controversy, particularly due to its mature themes, violence, and satirical commentary. However, for those who can appreciate the game for what it is—an open-world work of art—it offers a thrilling and unforgettable experience.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V on Steam is a must-have for any gaming enthusiast. It's a testament to the boundless creativity and ambition of Rockstar Games, offering a world that's a playground for chaos, storytelling, and exploration. If you haven't yet experienced the brilliance of Los Santos, there's never been a better time to dive in and see what all the hype is about.",True

"The single player is legendary of course.  But online? this game is literally nothing but hackers/ griefers. It is actually astounding how many of them there are. Not even worth it unless you too are cheating I guess. Hackers are in random missions, death matches, races you name it. none of them are playable.   You cant even roam around in a free roam lobby without some toxic clown emptying your inventory of all weapons, changing your car, making your car fly across the map, or blow up 1000 times in a second to crash your game. For that I honestly can not recommend this game to anyone. Watching paint dry is more fun than this game is online.",False

Once I even tried running down a hill after checking it was clear and got headshot from a helicopter that literally spawned right in front of me. Don't get me wrong I love challenging gun fights but when it takes me half an hour to finish one part of not even a proper mission it's just taking the piss",False

"GTA V was apart of many childhoods including mine. Before it got butchered with online updates.  Pros:  - Graphics, especially it being first released on Old Gen consoles, that have less then a GB of RAM by the way. (The PS3 had 512MB and The Xbox 360 also had 512 MB)  - Physics, despite it being a downgrade compared to GTA IV, its still very great and way ahead of its time.  - Open World, to this day, GTA V is probably the greatest free roam of all time in an open world. The cars, movies, buying clothing, robberies, really anything you can think of honestly.  - Story, its just iconic. Three main characters, living the American Dream.  - RAGE Engine, now this is somewhat apart of the Graphics section I mentioned, but I have to talk about the fact that this Engine got made 10+ years ago. And still holds up to this particular day and age. Absolutely amazing.  - Map Design, Los Santos is a really great map, just a very well made replica of LA.  - The Modding capabilites, I to this day. Play this game Modded, FiveM, the VR Mod, Steering wheel support, Trainers, it really blows out the competition in different games that dont come with modding support.  - AtD (Attention to Detail) R* has added alot of AtD to GTA V, like the flip flops that Michael can wear, literally flip flop!  - The Radio, the music catalogue in GTA V is very fitting and well thought of R* to increase the immersion and make it really feel like a Radio Station, the announcers, the music, the licenses, its pretty great honestly.  Cons:  - Alot parts of the map, are ""Wasteland"" what do I mean by saying this? well... despite the map being pretty large. Theres alot of spots that are just hills, sand, and it just gets repititive like ""Oh hey, I have been here before?""  - All side-characters are in my opinion, very irritating. Despite for example people like ""Debra"" while Trevor lived at Vespucci. Even though we only get to really see her once in a cutscene before she got killed by Trevor, you really could tell how much of an annoyance she would have been if she didnt die.  - GTAO, back then it was more about being a criminal in online and really playing like it was meant to be. Nowadays its filled with Jets, MK2, and shark cards that get bought with moms credit cards... lovely.  Overall:  If your looking for a great SP game, good Graphics even nowadays, and modding capabilites. Then you should definetly buy this! However, the online is at an all time low. Its not necessarily great and as mentioned, its filled with people who just blow you up, so if you really want to play online. Just go into Passive Mode.",True

"I am a 35 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 16 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",True

"This is one of the funniest outrageous games ever.  Humor in most everything.  A parody of life in Los Angeles. The story is great fun. You can play any one of the three main characters at any time (after you play through some of the story), and for a short time, a dog.  Listen to the many funny non-playable characters voices. The missions are challenging. And even when you don't feel like following the story, you can experiment as much as you want, explore the sandbox that is its open world.  I have played numerous hours every so often since  the game was released. I find it a good stress relief from a tough day at work, forget about things for a while.  If you have never played this masterpiece, I highly recommend you try it!",True

"No overarching plot leads to events feeling very disconnected. It's got a very inconsistent tone, it both doesn't take itself seriously and takes itself too seriously.   Let's compare this to GTA IV. GTA IV had a dark, gritty tone and serious story. Despite this, it was still able to crack jokes at times and be lighthearted. Most of all, the jokes didn't suck and weren't dropped every 5 minutes. GTA IV's missions also all connected together and interwove a tight plot that was entertaining.  I suppose it plays fine, but it's just really meh otherwise.",False

"It's GTAV. I don't care for the online aspect of it, but the Single Player offerings have been more than enough to   to bring me back to Los Santos time and again through the years. Some missions are a slog, specially the ones where you need to cross the map on a truck or some other slow vehicle, but there are widely available quality of life mods that make these kinds of activities much more bearable, such as the autodrive options in something like ENT — a must have for me personally.",True
"When I first payed it I was not impressed. But ten years later, after a decade going backward in terms of games quality, I can say this game is a masterpiece.   Still worth it in 2023, the graphics are still surprisingly good, the scenario is all you can expect from this type of game, and the city is just amazing.   Also, if you like this game, please try ""Sleeping Dogs"", still also worth it in 2023, with better hand to hand combats and amazing car chases.",True

"Rockstar has somehow kept this alive for 50,000 years. GTA VI will have an extremely high standard to live up to. Is mostly fun with friends to do missions or heists. The grind to get money is crazy hard but once you have stuff the game gets kind of boring. Servers are riddled with hackers and Oppressor Mk II's that make anyone who isn't a participant miserable. Occasionally you will come across lobbies where everyone is wholesome and those moments make it so worth it.  Car meets, chases, just messing around having fun with strangers and good vibes. 8/10 overall. Curious for GTA6.",True
"its kind of hard say no to all of this content, i got this on sale for roughly 35 dollars AUD with the criminal starter pack version.  this is the 3rd time ive purchased gta 5 over several consoles and it never fails to disappoint. most content in game can be purchased through playing the game or you can purchase shark cards to speed things up a little.  honestly, if you want gta 5 go get it. you wont regret it.",True

Having played on each variation of Xbox console since Day one of the game and logging thousand plus hours of playtime. To recently buying the PC version only to discover progress is non transferable and I have to start from scratch again which is annoying enough but to also find I cannot replace my vehicles because Rockstar has seen fit to remove them from the game is the final insult. I will not be buying anymore Rockstar games. As they are now no more than A blatant cash grab,False

I purchased this game to play with my sons.  Unfortunately it is impossible to play online with more than one computer in the same household.  We each have our own licensed copy but only one of us can connect to an online game with friends.  This issue has been posted all over the internet and the publisher has not done a thing to address it.  Do a google search before wasting your money.  I am not likely to purchase anything associated with Rockstar Games after this.,False

The average joe police/gangster/mercenary helicopter gunman are way overpowered in terms of accuracy. A lazer-guided robot wouldn't be that accurate. The player character is supposed to be one of the most talented characters in the game, whilst riding with other players or computers and with aim assist I find it very difficult to hit targets, therefore it should be at least that hard for the average chopper gunman, now I would understand a boss or even several stronger chopper characters, but these every day chopper gunman have curving bullets and x-ray vision, hell they hit you before your can apply armor after re-spawns. cant believe its gone 10 years like this. That is all. Also, I have a great RDR/GTA idea, but I think its worth far too much money to share on here.",True

CHEATERS CAN DO ANYTHING IN EACH SESSION, GIVE YOU MONEY, PLAY YOU THE INTRODUCTORY FILM OF GTA ONLINE, TELEPORT YOU ANYWHERE, ETC.

"I've owned this game a long time and now I can't play it. When I bought it my teenage daughter was sharing my account and the game is tied to one of her old rockstar accounts apparently. She's now an adult and not living with us but before she moved out we created her own steam account and I bought her her own copy of this game. Up until now, none of this was a problem. It was just logged in.  But I made this simple mistake of upgrading one of my hard drives. I cloned it to a larger, faster SSD but in the process Windwows gave it a different letter. It suddenly was looking for the launcher/social club on a drive letter that didn't exist and it said I didn't have space to install it. A little googling shows a consensus that this is a know issue and the only way to solve it is to use a 3rd party uninstaller to remove every trace of the old program.   I did that and it let me reinstall it. Finally. But now it wants me to log in with an account that was set up with my daughter close to a decade ago. There's no way around it. I can't log in with a new account, or with my own rockstar account that is tied to other games I own on this same steam account. I would buy another copy just to not have to deal with this BS but I can't do that in Steam with my existing account, and even my daughter isn't able to help me. So do I have to create a new steam account to play this game? Rockstar sucks.",False

"Everyone on PC should be voting this as a NEGATIVE review or change their reviews to Negative after Rockstar took away about 180 available cars to buy, from us PC users, & to top it off, you need GTA+ paid subscription to buy those cars that were taken away but to make things even worse, Rockstar Games GTA+ paid subscription isn't available on PC, only next-gen.

"Ok saya merubah review saya menjadi positif lagi pada GTA V onlline karena ada 'solo private session' yg membuat saya senang. Tetap harus selalu waspada ketika anda main GTA V online pada 'public session' ! setiap uang yg anda dapat secepat mungkin langsung deposit ke bank sebelum para modder dan cheater merampok anda, dan secepatnya pindah 'session' baru ketika situasi mulai rusuh oleh para modders dan cheaters.  Untuk Rockstar : Tolong rubah aturan 'penggantian nickname' dari setahun sekali menjadi sebulan atau seminggu sekali, agar kami bisa terhindar dari 'Bully' para modder dan cheater yg sudah hapal nickname kami.",True

"GTA V : Online is a load of fun, if you have friends that will play in a private session with you. I cannot attest to the public sessions, as I avoid them actively. But, if you don't have friends, you can still solo, it will just take you longer to achieve the same ends. Example: Caya Pericho has a 2.5 hour cooldown solo, and ~45 min cooldown with a partner or group.   With that said, I keep coming back for more, as I am a social gamer.  Highly recommend for other social gamers!",True

"Has become pay to cheat in so many levels. Delivery Missions are so repetitive, it gets old really quick. Rockstar decreased rewards from Missions, maybe to incentive Hacks - more likely. There are a lot of bugs, I can't even number them all. But for instance, you spend a lot of money to get a fully upgraded Nightclub, then it just stops working properly and you have to buy another one because that one bugged your products productions. You ask for a vehicle and it spawn miles away for no apparent reason. Something you wont get the rewards after spending 30 minutes of a pointless mission because of Transaction Bug. Enemies will spawn on weird places killing you after you made sure the coast was clear. Enemies wont stop spawning until you follow the script - which most of the time is annoying. If you go into a business, you have a 2% chance of blackscreen. Endless miles on slow trucks delivering stuff that could easily placed on top of a V8 Truck and speed the crap out of the sale, instead of wasting time driving 10mph. Everything is expensive and mission rewards are low. That's why there's so many cheaters, hacks and modders online. Rockstar bans people for cheating at the Casino, but keeps GodMode morons teleporting about ruining Open Activities.  Overall, better downloading a F2P wannabe GTA than paying and paying for cards to be outclassed by any random guy with access to a hacks forum.",False

"This game commits the unforgivable sin in all of gaming; selling the game on steam but then having a separate launcher. I didn't pay $80 of my hard earned money to jump through more hoops and then get soft locked out of my game because it didn't remember my sign in information. Emails to get my password changed go nowhere, and every action requires a tedious captcha that a robot could very easily fool.  It sucks being locked out of what could be a very good game, through a garbage third party launcher and vague, unhelpful support FAQ's from an enormous, faceless organisation. Least of all when I paid my money for it.",False

"I don't know we're to far down this games life to know what to say really.   It's awesome to finally have friend only lobbies with no punishment for not being public.  But the game is so full of hackers and so full of bot accounts now that it's hard to say public lobbies are good for anything anyway.   There's the RP world servers and mods I guess. but most of them are run by hypocrites or have long since been abandon by the people who used them,   GTA 4 & 5 have just come and gone the same way , it had its time in the sun , but now its a modders hellscape and you can't 'play' the game anymore.   Also rockstar is a bunch of irredeemable money grubbing A5@H0l#$  who made the game unplayable without hacking in money. prices on everything are to high now.

"Introduction: Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is not just a video game; it's an interactive crime saga that continues to captivate players across multiple platforms. Developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, GTA V has become a cultural phenomenon since its initial release in 2013. With a vast open-world setting, compelling characters, and a narrative that weaves together crime, humor, and drama, the game has earned its place as one of the most iconic titles in the gaming industry.  Graphics and Presentation (5/5): GTA V's sprawling landscape of Los Santos and Blaine County is a visual marvel. The attention to detail is staggering, with realistic character models, dynamic weather systems, and a day-night cycle that adds depth to the immersive environment. The game seamlessly transitions between the urban chaos of the city to the serene beauty of the countryside, creating a living, breathing world that feels authentic and alive.  Character Development and Narrative (4.5/5): The heart of GTA V lies in its three protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—each with their own distinct personalities, motivations, and story arcs. The narrative weaves their tales together in a way that keeps players invested in the lives of these morally ambiguous characters. The writing is sharp, and the dialogue is filled with humor and social commentary, creating a narrative that feels both entertaining and thought-provoking.  Gameplay and Open World (5/5): GTA V's open-world design is a testament to Rockstar's mastery of game development. The map is vast and diverse, offering a mix of urban landscapes, suburban neighborhoods, and expansive countryside. The ability to seamlessly switch between the three protagonists adds a unique layer to the gameplay, allowing players to experience different perspectives and playstyles.  The game's missions are varied and offer a mix of action-packed heists, intense shootouts, and entertaining side activities. From high-speed chases to leisurely rounds of golf, the open-world freedom is one of GTA V's greatest strengths. The addition of GTA Online further extends the gameplay, providing a massive multiplayer sandbox for players to explore and engage in criminal enterprises with friends.  Soundtrack and Sound Design (5/5): GTA V boasts a soundtrack that complements the game's atmosphere perfectly. The radio stations feature a diverse range of music genres, providing a dynamic and immersive audio experience. The voice acting is top-notch, with memorable performances that bring the characters to life. The ambient sounds of the city, from the bustling streets to the distant sounds of police sirens, contribute to the game's overall realism.  Conclusion: Grand Theft Auto V stands as a landmark achievement in the gaming industry. Its combination of stunning graphics, engaging narrative, diverse gameplay, and a meticulously crafted open world sets a standard that few games can match. Despite its age, GTA V continues to draw players into its criminal underworld, proving that it's not just a game; it's an enduring masterpiece that transcends generations. Whether you're a newcomer or a returning player, GTA V remains a must-play title that showcases the immense potential of interactive storytelling in gaming.  Rating 10/10",True

"This game is perfectly balanced for cheaters and temporary account buyers. A 5$ account can permit you to record youTube nonsense about laughing of poor player who don't have billions of GTA cash, and allowed you to feel like a MAN riding your flying motorcycle with invincibility cheat mode, even before you get your first facial hairs for the low low price of messing and discouraging others fair players who only wants to wine down after a tough day at school or work, depending if you live in an occidental country or where the minimum age for legal work is as soon as you can hold the required tool. Years ago that was a great game i had more then my share of that game nearly a thousand hours but since Crooked Star inc. cancelled the dunce’s cap (I supposed) nobody know but there are only cheaters cheating cheaters, and that is a mouth full only saying it so, imagine playing it! The thing i never understood is those games with the most annoying and unnecessary proprietary launcher, are the games with the most cheaters. I guess 7.7 billions is not enough to pay for game admin or research in new anti cheat tech.  Croocked Star: Yes but we have the ban player option and that work perfectly. Players: But it take many days, so our game session is ruined. Imagine a FIFA world event where no soccer ball would keep is inflation on the event day, and the soccer ball companies would answer come back in 2 days our balloon will be ok then, just rent few more night a the hotel and don't worry the air plane companies will be OK with that Pinky swear wink wink!

"Grand Theft Auto as of making this review, is almost 10 years old. Sure, this game is 10 years old, but I think it sure as hell still holds up. The community is pretty good, of course there are lots of trolls and modders, but putting that out of the way, you have a really fun game. Story mode is good, but if you want a revolutionary story, go get RDR2, if you just want a fun time, Get GTA, especially on sale. Cannot wait for GTA 6",True

Nevertheless, it's a game that never loses its charm, and you'll find yourself saying, ""You Forget A Thousand Things Every Day, Pal. Make Sure This Is One Of 'Em."" just for fun. [h2] Additional comments [/h2] Having played GTA V since 2013, I can confidently say it's a game that never gets old. The transition to PC was smooth, and even though hackers can occasionally disrupt the experience, playing with friends makes up for it. The storyline remains a standout, and while a powerful PC isn't required, a mid-range modern PC handles the game well. Keep in mind that the online mode can be grindy, but there's no shortage of activities to keep you entertained in Los Santos. With the possibility of GTA 6 on the horizon, it's an exciting time to be a GTA fan.  [hr][/hr]  [h1] Overall Summary [/h1] Grand Theft Auto V continues to shine in 2023 as a tactical masterpiece with an engaging storyline and a vibrant online community. While newcomers may find the game's complexity challenging, playing with friends enhances the experience. However, it's important to note that there are no more DLC updates planned for GTA Online, and the possible release of GTA 6 in the coming years could change the landscape of the series. Despite these considerations, GTA V remains a timeless classic that offers countless hours of enjoyment in the sprawling world of Los Santos, where even iconic lines like ""You Forget A Thousand Things Every Day, Pal. Make Sure This Is One Of 'Em."" have become legendary memes in the gaming community.",True

"It's an addicting game, but still super buggy. It's even worse if you want to actually play online with other players, as the load times are horrendous, and they get even worse when there is an inevitable modder in the server. If you haven't started playing GTA online, dont bother, unless you want to spend half of your session on your phone during the loading screens.  And don't even get me started on Rockstar's greedy practices. Removing around 200 vehicles that can be bought back easier with GTA plus, nerfing Cayo Perico heist again and again, holding some ten year anniversary items behind a paywall (GTA plus).... that's just what's on the tip of my tongue.   I kinda wish I never started playing, because now I can't stop, which subjects me to hours of frustration when I want to play with other players. I strongly suggest finding another game to get addicted to.  EDIT: I somehow failed to mention that if the load times in public lobbies weren't bad enough, the modders will make things worse. You are GUARANTEED to run into a modder who will do anything they can to ruin your experience, from constantly blowing you up, to destroying your product, and sometimes spawning you elsewhere out of the blue. It's an absolute s h i t show.",False

"Incredibly, astoundingly, amazing, remarkably HORRIBLE online play experience because the utterly rampant cheating.  The single-player (for some reason called ""Story Mode"") is actually pretty fun. But when that's over, since there isn't really a difficulty rating you can adjust, the only thing left is the online multiplayer mode.  Presumably if you have a good group of friends who will NOT be cheating, then this is probably also pretty fun.  Unfortunately, the public online experience is really just a gigantic, systemically empowered griefer utopia.  So yeah, parts of this are very fun, it's certainly visually gorgeous. But replayability and longevity are extremely limited.  Don't fool yourself into ""It can't be that bad!"" because it's utterly, insanely filthy with cheats that have bizarre superpowers and will make you regret wasting the time trying.",False

I WAS PLANNING TO PLAY SOLO CHEAT MODE WITH WEMOD INFINITE MONEY SO I CAN BUY FOOD AND JUST WALK AROUND AND EAT AND ENJOY THE CITY VIEW AND GO TO THE PARK OR PLAY WITH ANIMALS OR SOMETHING. BUT I DID NOT KNOW YOU HAD TO START THE GAME BY COMMITTING A CRIME. I LIKE PLAYING GUYS WITH GOOD KARMA AND THIS GAME IS A PIECE OF SH!T. THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE REASONS SO MANY AMERICANS ARE GETTING KILLED. AS AN EDUCATOR, I KNOW THIS GAME IS EVIL ENOUGH TO DRIVE MANY YOUNG PEOPLE TOWARDS LITERAL DAMNATION BY ATTACKING POLICE OFFICERS. WHOEVER MADE THIS GAME IS LITERALLY SATAN OR WORKING FOR SATAN. I HAVE TO SAY I AM VERY ANGRY WITH THIS GAME AND BROTHER YEHOWAH WILL DAMN THIS GAME TO THE GROUND. WHOEVER PLAYS THIS GAME AND MASSACRES POLICE ETC MUST REPENT OF THEIR SINS. I GIVE THIS GAME A MINUS INFINITY. THIS GAME IS CURSED. THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT ME WASTING 30 USD BUYING THIS S@@T GAME IS THAT I GET TO POST THIS MESSAGE AND HOPEFULLY SOMEONE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS EVIL SICK TWISTED F@@KING GAME THAT PROBABLY INLFUENCED SOMEONE TO DO ACTCS OF GUN VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHER PEOPLE. MAY BROTHER YEHOWAH (OR WHATEVER GOD YOU WORSHIP) DAMN THIS GAME.",False

"Hello, I just wanted to say that I am having this issue similar to many others. and after looking at some of the reviews on the game that I have enjoyed ever since i got it back in like 2017. I am going to tell my story about Rockstar Games. and how they barley do anything regarding people's accounts getting compromised without them knowing. My Rockstar Social Club Account has since got hijacked without me knowing. and I cannot play both GTA IV, GTA V, and RDR 2 anymore due to the Rockstar Social Club Account that is linked to my Steam Account being hijacked. I have since lost the Original Email to the Rockstar Social Club Account and I probably need to buy another copy of GTA V, GTA IV, and RDR 2 somewhere else, so thanks to Rockstar with their unacceptable actions, and barley helping me with anything regarding this issue. I have no way to play the games made by them anymore. I have since lost all of my respect as a company and a corporation. Rockstar has further damaged their reputation as a company to myself, and many others. and I sense that there is gonna probably be a lawsuit about this whole thing soon. and I'll be waiting for some kind of thing that will fix all of this.  Thank you for taking your time to read all of this.  From,  Seth The Incubus",False

"The only thing Rockstar cares about is selling shark cards. they are constantly taking things away to bring them back either time gated, or hidden behind GTA plus. it's nothing more than a money grab at this point. they keep making it worse to try and push people to buy more shark cards and GTA plus. Rockstar is a Hollow shell of it's former self and care for nothing but how much they can take from you. Story, gameplay and fun take a backseat to the money grab. it's just gross.",False
"This game has story mode (offline, by yourself)  and online mode (you, and your friends, enemies, strangers, griefers, everyone else)  This review is mostly for the online portion of the game. First, it's a great game.  They do weekly updates, so every week new stuff is on sale, different cars, different businesses (usually), and they'll change some of the payouts on different tasks, heists and businesses.  There's daily tasks you can do that respawn every day in different places as well.  It can be a car game, a fighting game, a shooting game, a heist game  The empire building part is what I like,  start a business, and set it up, most of them can make passive money whenever you're online.   Arcade, Agency, Night Club, Drug labs, Bunker, Aircraft Hangar, tons of heists, arena racing, auto shop, bike shop, warehouses, private military stuff, whatever you want. And you can run everything all at once.  Or you can just run around killing strangers for no reason. (you will get killed right back though).  Game has lots of flaws, character mechanics are weird, but it's a 10 year old game. It's alos really frustrating sometimes, either because of some other weird game mechanic, or because some rando on the internet decides to give you grief for no reason (""it's part of the game"").  You can set up private, friend only, or crew only lobbies now, and still do all the missions so I run my nightclub like that, do the daily stuff, and buy the things I want when they go on sale.  I bought this game lots of times on lots of different systems (PS3, PS4, PS5 and lots of PC guys),  PC is the best because you don't need to subscribe to PS-Plus, or X-box Live to play online,  but there are advantages to playing on a ""current gen"" Xbox/PS console (more content). I mostly stick to PC now, though I do play on PS sometimes.  It goes on sale for around $15 all the time, buy it.",True

"i only play gta online: there are to many hackers, its like an pest. and rockstard dont give a shit either.... the lobby's needs 2-4 players for the heists, witch is fine until the some one leaves a prep or in the heist, and everyone get boted, and you have to manually drive back (most of the time) to restart the heist again, and again, and again. but if you can find proper people that know what to do and stays and dont leave you right befour the end check. well then you might kicked buy a hacker at the end of the heist, oh and not to forget to get agent or prisoner to actually move and follow you, cause agent ulp mission, that is 70/30 chance he moves or not. the loading screen is allso a lucky wheel to spin. either it works fine, or you have a black screen for 2 min, or you have to restart the game. however i find alot of aspects of the game interessting, but the game gets old fast, doing the same heist over and over again will get old, and with people leaving the game etch, + the hackers it gets even more Old faster. id even say that you could try wow befour this game anestly, but if you decide to try. well, the best of luck to you",False

"Positive Comment:  Grand Theft Auto V on PC is an absolute masterpiece when it comes to gaming. The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking; the level of detail in Los Santos and Blaine County is simply mind-blowing. From the bustling city streets to the serene countryside, every inch of this virtual world is a visual treat.  The gameplay is equally exceptional, offering a seamless blend of action, driving, and exploration. The controls are smooth and responsive, ensuring an immersive experience whether you're cruising in a luxury car or engaging in high-octane shootouts.  But what truly sets GTA V apart is its gripping story mode. The characters are well-developed, and the narrative is both thrilling and thought-provoking. The game's multiple protagonists add depth and variety to the storytelling, making it an unforgettable journey through the criminal underbelly of Los Santos.  Moreover, the online mode provides endless hours of fun. The variety of activities, from heists to races to free-roam shenanigans, keeps players engaged for years. The regular updates and new content additions by Rockstar Games ensure that the online world of GTA V remains fresh and exciting.  Negative Comment:  However, there's one glaring issue that continues to plague GTA V on PC, and that's the rampant presence of modders in the online community. While modding can enhance the single-player experience and lead to some creative and fun gameplay additions, it's become a double-edged sword in the online realm.  The presence of malicious modders who disrupt the game, spawn impossible-to-defeat enemies, or harass honest players is a significant drawback. It creates a hostile environment that can make online play frustrating and unpleasant for many players. The lack of effective anti-cheat measures has allowed this problem to persist, and it's disheartening to see that Rockstar hasn't addressed it adequately.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V on PC is an incredible game that excels in graphics, gameplay, and story mode. However, the persistent issue with modders in the online community casts a shadow over an otherwise fantastic gaming experience, making it challenging for honest players to enjoy the game to its fullest. Rockstar Games should take stronger measures to curb this problem and ensure a more enjoyable online experience for all players.",True

"Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is a true masterpiece of gaming, an extraordinary experience that sets the bar high for open-world action-adventure games. Developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, this title has earned its place in the annals of gaming history for its remarkable storytelling, vast and immersive world, and an unparalleled level of detail.  A Thrilling Tale of Crime and Intrigue: At the heart of GTA V is its engrossing narrative. The game effortlessly weaves together the stories of three complex protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber trying to escape his past; Franklin, a street-smart hustler looking for a way out of the gang life; and Trevor, a volatile and unhinged ex-military pilot. Their paths intersect in a gripping tale of crime, ambition, and betrayal that keeps players hooked from start to finish.  A Living, Breathing World: Los Santos, the fictional recreation of Los Angeles in GTA V, is a marvel in itself. It's a sprawling, dynamic city filled with bustling streets, diverse neighborhoods, and an array of activities. The attention to detail is astonishing, from the realistic traffic patterns to the vibrant ecosystems found in the countryside. The world feels alive, with pedestrians going about their business, radio stations playing music and talk shows, and a day-night cycle that adds to the immersion.  Endless Activities and Diversions: GTA V offers an abundance of activities beyond the main storyline. Whether you want to explore the underwater depths, embark on a hunting expedition in the wilderness, or engage in a thrilling race, there's always something to do. The variety of side missions, challenges, and hobbies ensure that boredom is a concept that doesn't exist in this open-world gem.  Unparalleled Attention to Detail: Rockstar's dedication to detail is evident in every nook and cranny of the game. The characters' facial expressions, the meticulously designed vehicles, the witty in-game radio commentary, and the intricate interiors of buildings all contribute to an unparalleled level of immersion. It's a testament to the developer's commitment to creating a world that feels authentic and lived-in.  Online Multiplayer: Grand Theft Auto Online adds a whole new dimension to the GTA V experience. It allows players to explore Los Santos with friends, engage in heists, participate in races, and create their own criminal empires. The constantly evolving online world ensures that there's always something fresh to experience, fostering a sense of community and camaraderie among players.  Continued Support and Updates: Rockstar's commitment to GTA V doesn't end with its initial release. The game has received numerous updates, expansions, and content drops, ensuring that it remains relevant and exciting years after its launch. This ongoing support speaks to the developer's dedication to the GTA V community.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a tour de force in the world of gaming, a title that effortlessly combines a gripping narrative, a living, breathing open world, and an abundance of activities to create an experience like no other. Its attention to detail, commitment to storytelling, and ongoing support make it an enduring classic that will continue to captivate players for years to come.

It plays smooth as silk.  GTA Online is great, but not without huge flaws. A majority of my time played was in GTA online. It's a great sandbox with a lot of worth-while content to play, especially with friends. But holy hell, it lost its soul over the years. There's a lot of tedium, a lot of paywalls, and little to no balancing in the PvP or in-game economy, not to mention the modding problem on PC. There's still a lot to enjoy, but your experience may vary depending on what you value, and your patience.",True
Buy it for the Single Player.  Do not touch the Multiplayer.  I would give it a thumbs up BUT modders can kill you even if you mind your own business in Single Player.  I HATE Rockstar for how easily they let modding scum run rampant. GTA 6 wont be different form this.,False
"If you're getting GTA 5 for the love of god, get it for the story mode, enjoy that and then ignore online unless you're playing via something like FiveM. Base GTA Online is one of the worst experiences that forces you to either pay or grind for hours to get one car that looks kinda cool. Developers upping the Cayo Perico heist cooldown when done solo really did online in for me, personally. Raising cooldowns on solo, efficient grinding methods while showing ads for the micro transactions in the hour long loading screen is a complete joke. I have more fun in Red Dead Online and Rockstar does not care about RDO at all.   GTA Online is infected with so many levels of irony poisoning that Rockstar isn't even sure if they're parodying themselves or not anymore.  Besides that, fantastic story mode with admittedly repetitive gameplay in most missions. Heists, Three's Company and the missions like those are a nice break from the formula of ""Drive here, kill a bunch of guys, drive again, kill again, done."" that the series has faced criticism for. The real focal point is the story but I'm sure you knew that already.  Story mode 9/10  GTA Online 2/10",True

"Even 8 years later, this game is easily one of the best that you can buy.  Whilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I don't like - and wouldn't really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage - I can't ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities - there's something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make them money whilst they're at it.  Single Player is also undeniably a brilliant experience. Even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story, there's really no excuse for not playing it through at least once.  A lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since it's original release, but from an objective point of view, even if this game released for the very first time this year, it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away.  The driving is much easier than GTA 4, literally anyone can be a decent driver in GTA 5 unless you have brain damage, but I guess it makes it more accessible, lol. Shooting is also much improved and is high quality, and those two elements combined with many others, including but not limited to the excellent map, make this game a perfect sandbox",True

"First off the game is great, in fact it's amazing. Everyone knows that.    I can't recommend this game though because of the awful Social Club and equally awful Rockstar Games Services DRM B.S. you have to deal with.    Played this game fine a few years ago.  I go back to play it and it turns out the email I used to set up Social Club is one I no longer have access to.  Therefore I can't login and can't play the game. Period.   I've been in contact with Rockstar support for a week and still haven't resolved the issue.  I've gone back and forth with them five or six times and every time they want some other proof I bought the damn game. I've sent them four or five screenshots of receipts, Steam ID bla bla bla and it's never enough.  It's ridiculous.  Now even though I have a current Social Club account with an email I can actually access they need a THIRD email to use to ""update my account""?  WTF?  Forget it I'm sick of it.  I even bought a physical copy off of Ebay to try and get around this issue.  No go, Physical copy makes no difference.  Unless I continue to jump through their hoops I will never be able to play GTAV again on PC.  Seriously you guys made tons of money off this game what's the deal with the draconian DRM?  I'm old enough to remember when you bought a game on PC it came in a nice box with a nice manual and maybe even some bonus items with an actual CD or (GASP) floppy disk that contained the entire game and it was yours to keep and play forever.  Now for your money you get a digital copy that's DRM protected to a ridiculous degree that you can't play if you want to try and change something as simple as your email.  Crap like this is why gaming just isn't as fun as it used to be.  Those days are gone, greed has completely taken over the industry when it comes to AAA games such as this.  Loved the GTA series up until this point but this is so stupid guys, I'm out on GTA6 not that it makes any damn difference.",False
this thing is way too good,True
"I've been playing GTA V since it's initial release on the Xbox 360 back in 2013. Obviously it wasn't a consistent play time, it was off and on. Today, I received an email stating my account has been suspended for 30 days an my character reset. I figured it was a bad attempt at a phishing email, so I brushed it off. As the day progressed, I thought about that email more and more, and gave in. I loaded up GTA and got into story without any issues(as it should), then proceeded to try to join online. Right then, it hit me. Suspended for 30 days and character reset.  Since cheating had come to online play, I have exclusively played in invite only sessions to avoid the chance of running into someone who would throw money at me. Did this make the game slightly more difficult? Yes, but was worth not having to worry about cheaters.  I went to open a ticket to just try to find out what would justify the suspension/reset, but I am unable to even do that since you can't dispute the issue. GTA, you were once a game that I loved and enjoyed playing, but this is the end for me. I'll patiently wait for GTA VI to release. It was a good run.",False

"Welcome to Los Santos, the city where every traffic jam is an opportunity and every pedestrian is a potential punchline. ""Grand Theft Auto V"" is not just a game; it's a chaotic carnival of crime where the rules are made to be broken, and the laughs come faster than you can steal a sports car.  Let's talk about the main characters: Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. These guys are like the Three Stooges of the criminal underworld, with a little less slapstick and a lot more firepower. Michael's midlife crisis is a comedy goldmine, Trevor is a walking, talking wrecking ball of insanity, and Franklin is the guy trying to keep it all together while wondering how he ended up in this circus.  Now, the city itself is your playground, and the possibilities are endless. You can rob a bank, fly a plane, drive a tank, or just play a round of golf with the same enthusiasm and incompetence as a toddler in a candy store. And if you're feeling particularly artistic, you can create your own chaos masterpiece, starring you as the criminal Picasso of Los Santos.  The radio stations are pure gold, with DJs and talk show hosts that are funnier than most stand-up comedians. You'll find yourself driving aimlessly, just to hear the next ridiculous radio skit or catchy tune. And don't even get me started on the in-game internet. It's like a parody of the real thing, complete with hilarious ads and social media that makes you question the sanity of the virtual world.  But it's not all fun and games in Los Santos. The police are like an overzealous neighborhood watch on steroids. One minor fender bender, and suddenly you've got a 5-star wanted level, and half the city's police force chasing you down. It's like the world's worst game of tag, and you're ""it"" for life.  And let's not forget the pedestrians. They're like a walking, talking sitcom cast. They'll insult you, make inappropriate comments, and sometimes even try to fight you. It's like being in a never-ending episode of a reality TV show where everyone's competing for the title of ""Most Outrageous Citizen of Los Santos.""  In conclusion, ""GTA 5"" is a wild, open-world sandbox where crime and comedy collide in a spectacularly entertaining fashion. It's a game that lets you live out your wildest criminal fantasies while laughing at the sheer absurdity of it all. So, grab your controller, steal a car, and get ready for a rollercoaster ride through the hilarious and chaotic world of ""Grand Theft Auto V""!",True

"Продолжим нашу экзикуцию Я ставлю игре средний бал еслиб стим позволял поставил бы и визуально Начнем с минусов, в сравнении с прошлой игрой серии гта 4 многое поменялось, поехали. Зачем нам рпг за пазухой в которой соседствует ещё 3 волыны карабины и 3 пулемета и попутно 9 пистолетов? хрен его знает. Физика машин, о да в гта 4 было приятно мять машины но машины просто могли взорватся и все, в гта 5 немного порадовало что можно пробить бензобак или начнет капать масло и движок заглохнет, но как можно было так ухудшить управление машин и повреждения?! Карта игры, в гта 4 явно видны черты треугольника из гта 3 к примеру аэропорт хоть и переехал немного но все же +- города похожи с той разницей что в игре прошло 7 лет от гта 3 до гта 4 но тоже странно но ладно. Гта са события идут в 1992 году в гта 5 2013, 21 год разницы событий у игры как за 21 год у Лос Сантоса появилось +- 10 высоток в центре города, город стал как лабиринт выросла огромная хер знает откуда загорадная местность которая даже в Гта Сан не было и самое главное куда пропали соседние города Сан-Фиерро и Лас-Вентурас?! Онлайн режим это вообще что-то с чем-то как можно было сделать так что 90% игроков в МУЛЬТИПЛЕЕРНОЙ ИГРЕ РАЗБЕГАЮТСЯ ПО ОДНОМУ В ЗАКРЫТЫЕ СЕССИИ В МУЛЬТИПЛЕЕРЕ, а я скажу почему, слишком много читеров был бы у рокстар нормальные сервера и бан по железу может их бы и не было но все же, роки делают миссии которые были только кооператив уже в соло гениально же да? Или вот идешь ты продавать там товар какой-то игра тебе говорит получишь по 5к за каждого человека в сессии дополнительно за продажу, а в сессии толкучка из 30+- человек. Последние обновления сделаны из готовых ассетов игры потому-что добавлять что-то новое игра уже не вывозит и они успешно вырезали из игры про автоугон 1/7 машин и мотоциклов из списков на сайтах, за то яхту которая никому не всралась и чисто понтанутся они оставили Достижение вообще не о чем, умудрились сделать их вообще не интересными в получении, а наоборот жопоразрывающим и скучным занятием по поиску 30 кусков подлодки, ядерки и тд,  Мой вердикт таков что я не рекомендую покупать гта 5 в 2023 году, купите лучше что-то другое например рдр2 или там Atomic Heart, Sabnautica: Below Zero. Я бы не покупал игру но мне её подарили. Кто думает что я забыл про графу ""Плюсы игры"" мой вам ответ, а в чем радость игра в заезжаное говно 2013 года которое как лагало на дате выхода так до сих пор и лагает но чуточку меньше, в чем радость хавать говно под видом что тебе это нравится? Мне это все не сильно нравится.  Я закончу пожалуй на этом свой трактат.",False

"It's unfortunate there is yet to be another game as ambitious as this one. A game that could rival the decade old GTA V in scope, a game that could be owned and operated by a competent company that actually cares about the state of their project and the satisfaction of the community.   It's a travesty that GTA V is the only game in its class, because Rockstar sucks. I'll never understand how I've amassed over a thousand hours on this shit-show of a game that progressively gets worse in an infinite loop of one step forward, two steps back. It's clear that Rockstar wants to push the game in a FOMO direction, and they're not subtle about it in any way. They removed the ability to purchase hundreds of vehicles that had been added over time, and they now drip-feed a handful of them every week. The ""GTA+"" battlepass shlock they're pushing on consoles is only further indicative of this direction. They want to incentivize players to pay exuberant prices for in-game content instead of providing more viable means of earning currency in-game. As I write this, Rockstar is allegedly planning to nerf the BEST way to make money in the game, on the basis of wanting to, ""provide players with greater incentives to experience the full range of content available."" Why not just make EVERYTHING to be a viable source of income? Why not increase the payouts of adversary modes and content missions, why not make outdated businesses with poor payouts like Import/Export actually viable? Because at the end of the day, Rockstar's main goal is to make money. They don't care about encouraging variety in their gameplay: They want players to give up the grind and give in to micro-transactions. It's too bad that the GTA community doesn't have the same solidarity and willpower as other communities—I'm looking at you, War Thunder. Perhaps if the community created enough of an uproar, things would change for the better.   But even if we ignore the blatant greed of Rockstar and the way they have gradually fucked over the economy of the game, the state of GTA Online on PC is sad. Rockstar has almost entirely neglected the game. Everyone knows about the modders. They're not that big a deal, apart from the ones who have the ability to crash the game for YOU specifically (among other malicious exploits I've yet to encounter), but they are still a nuisance.   On top of the godmode abusers present in every lobby, there's a whole set of content that PC players have been refused access to—content entirely exclusive to current gen consoles. Why? No one fucking knows! Rockstar is anything BUT transparent: It has been over a year since the ""Expanded and Enhanced"" edition of GTA released for those platforms, yet Rockstar has never once broken silence about the delayed released of the content on PC. The entire lack of communication between the community and the developers is inexcusable.  I've put a lot of time into this game, and I still continue to despite my grievances, but it's not worth it. If you've yet to play GTA Online, or you're considering returning, heed my words: Do not waste your time with this game. At least not in the way I have. Have fun blowing your friends up with bazookas. Just try not to get caught up in the intoxicating pursuit of wealth.  That said, GTA V's story isn't bad. A bit dated, sure, but I'd reckon it's still worth playing.",False

"From start to finish the ""story"" really tells you a decent story. I've personally never seen anything special in grand theft auto.

"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",True

"There are 2 sides to GTA V, there is the story mode and there is the... online, or I guess you could call it hack-fest. My review isn't on the online portion of the game though. I would have to say the game of GTA V is probably one of the most nostalgic and well crafted game mechanics out there! If I were to recommend this game to anyone I would recommend to play the story! This game has an amazing story to it, well put together and just an all around well told story all the way up to the final missions of the game. The voice acting is top tier! The cast did an amazing job getting you immersed into the story, you can genuinely feel the characters and their emotions I would almost say its kind of like a movie almost. The game works well not very many bugs maybe a few here and there but what game doesn't. This story is one to definitely remember, one of the best stories to a modern day game based in todays society portrayed in a really well put way! There isn't very many games based in our time-frame or our modern life mostly they are based in the future or way in the past or they are horror games. For a game to feel as real as GTA V with top tier voice acting and a well put together story I would have to recommend this game for that reason alone... don't play online.",True

"[h1] My GTA V Review [/h1] [h3] Rating: 4 out of 10 stolen cars [/h3] [hr][/hr]  [h2] Graphics [/h2] The graphics of the game are good, and even though the game was released over 10 years ago, you can still enjoy them. However, graphics are not the most important aspect, as we all know.  [h2] User Interface [/h2] The user interface is simple yet clear; I have absolutely nothing to complain about in this regard.  [h2] Performance [/h2] With my PC, I've never had any issues with the game and could always play it at maximum settings. However, this also depends on the type of PC you have.  [h2] Controls [/h2] The controls are simple and fully customizable, but they could offer more (I personally miss functions like being able to lie down in combat, and sometimes, the weapon wheel behaves a bit strangely).  [h2] Story in Singleplayer & Characters [/h2] The story mode is decent. The narrative isn't outstanding but is still interesting. The three main characters are well-written, although they can sometimes come across as cliché. Nonetheless, each of them has a (limited) background story, and you understand their motivations for their individual actions. Unfortunately, I personally miss the ability to influence the story or at least individual missions and the option of three different endings doesn't make it any better when the path to them is absolutely linear, and as a player, you have no influence on the game world or anything else. I'll give half a point for the singleplayer heists, which offer at least two different approaches for most heists, providing some variety.  [h2] Character, Weapon, and Car Customization & Modifications [/h2] I think it's cool that you can customize, tune, and paint your weapons and cars as you wish, both in singleplayer and multiplayer. There are more options available for cars, which makes sense. When it comes to clothing, it's a bit different. While you can customize your character in multiplayer and distribute outfits accordingly, you can't do the same in singleplayer. The outfits of the playable characters always reset (unfortunately, you also can't change the main vehicle of the three main characters in singleplayer).  [h2] Immersion [/h2] While the game world of GTA V initially looks lively because it's filled with NPCs going about their activities, it becomes clear that it's not quite as dynamic as it appears. NPCs sometimes behave strangely, repeat the same animations when certain events occur, and sometimes, they don't even have a sense of orientation. For instance, I observed a police car ramming into my car repeatedly for about 3 minutes instead of simply going around it. It's also bizarre how quickly you can accumulate wanted stars from the police and how fast they arrive, respawn, and seem to always know your exact location. Another annoying feature in multiplayer is the calls you receive every time you enter the game. These are usually 2 to 4 calls from NPCs telling you the same things. You have to answer these calls each time before you can hang up.  [h2] City & Game World Exploration [/h2] The game world is large, offering a variety of different areas, making it feel like a realistic city and its surroundings. There's a large urban area representing a typical US city, areas with a lot of nature, and smaller, more remote towns.  [h2] Music [/h2] The music in the missions is okay but nothing special. What I find fantastic, however, is the selection of radio stations; there's something for every musical taste, and if someone can't find anything they like, there's the feature to add your own music. Simply fantastic!  [h2] Gameplay & Missions in Online Mode [/h2] After about 10 years, the online mode is a joke. Initially, when I bought the game, I liked it because of the many options for character customization, apartments, garages, and the open world to explore and complete missions. Unfortunately, the game, at least for me, quickly became boring because the missions are often the same or similar, making it less enjoyable.  [h2] New Content & Updates? [/h2] Over the years, some content has been added to the multiplayer (not always good content), while the singleplayer was left empty. New cars and weapons were never implemented in the singleplayer, probably because they couldn't make additional money from it.  [h2] Online Balancing & Pay to Win [/h2] In multiplayer, there are sometimes ridiculously overpowered weapons and cars that throw the game's balance out the window. These items, as well as some clothing and cars, are so expensive that it's tedious to earn them in-game. But luckily, you have the option to buy Shark Cards (in-game currency) with real money! (Sarcasm) This way, you can have the perfect combination of overpriced in-game items that pay-to-win players can easily acquire (if they're willing to invest their hard-earned money into an online game)...  [h2] Apartments & Garages [/h2] When I saw that it was possible to buy apartments and garages at the beginning, I was excited and saved up until I could afford one. Unfortunately, the disappointment was greater than I expected: from the cheapest to the most expensive, they have very few functions (except for being chosen as spawn points and some having a garage for cars). You can interact with some things, like drinking smoothies, watching TV, or getting your character so drunk that they pass out. While garages still serve a purpose, apartments are pretty much useless (unless you want to plan heists). You're better off investing your extra money in a good armored car or weapons.  [h2] Cheaters & Modding [/h2] I could maybe overlook these other issues if GTA Online could finally deal with the wave of cheaters. The problem existed years ago, and it still exists today. Players who play normally get banned, partly because of cheaters (who might shower you with a ton of money in a short time, resulting in an automatic ban), while players who obviously cheat, using explosive ammunition, becoming invincible, teleporting, or blatantly spawning cars, whales, or Ferris wheels, don't get banned, or it takes forever. Today was the first time in a while that I played GTA V, and when I entered multiplayer, it was hard to find a lobby without at least one cheater unless you're in a private session.  [h2] Replayability [/h2] I would play the game again for the story mode, as I currently do. While other games have captivated me more, it always depends on personal preference and the type of games one prefers. To experience different endings or have an alternative to multiplayer, it's worth it.  [h2] Summary [/h2] If you're interested in the story mode, I can still recommend it, but the multiplayer is absolutely not worth it (anymore).

"Buyer beware- Do not purchase this game with the expectation that you'll actually be able to play this game in public lobbies. Every. Single. Lobby is filled with kids using Mod Menus. I won't list all the stuff that they do but it's constant kicking from lobby, crashing your game, forcing animations on your character, teleporting you to random missions in the game, dropping weapons on your character that are a major pain to get rid of, taking control of your character when driving or doing anything, removing all cars from lobby.   These mods make all the load times longer. & guess what happens to the poor kids that report these blatant cheaters? The mod menu notifies the mod user that a report has been sent, tells them who sent the report, and blocks the report from ever making it to the server. So guess who starts getting harassed? A young unsuspecting kid.   Online is unplayable, it's a horrible experience. Rockstar promoting the PC version of this game as ""Online"" is nothing short of fraud. There is no online, there are public lobbies filled with modders. Absolute dumpster fire.  If you purchase this game with the intention of playing it online, I assure you, you will be very disappointed.",False

"Better off playing the story and role playing servers than the pure garbage of a cash grab online mode which you seriously need great internet protection from modders/hackers in the online game if you don't want to end up having your internet destroyed. So yeah don't play online, Rockstar Games doesn't care for your opinions and your safety.",True
"While there are Loads of great reasons to play, the few that make it VERY hard to play could have been mostly fixed over the years. i.e. The incredibly poor match making system; while the game is cross platform finding a group (and almost ALL missions REQUIRE 4 people) the only people it will match you with are existing people in the CURRENT instance you are in, mixed with a few ""quick job"" joiners. Another example would be the very long load times, I mean VERY long, and on top of that there are a lot of times the game ""Fails to load session"" so after spending 2-3 hours getting a squad that is not just people trying to ruin the run (Who are in no way punished for Griefing a squad even if reported nothing will get done) your game will get stuck loading or give a ""Failed to join session"" error pretty frequently thus undoing your hours of work.  In short, Rockstar games Could have taken the loads of money and fixed some stuff but have never done so. these basic game functions failing along with other players regularly (Very common) using cheat codes /trainers to teleport to you take your money, kill you with a rocket at point blank range and teleport to the next player in the session (Never being punished even when reported you will see the same people still doing the same thing. Unless this is just for single player story, I would never recommend this game as anything other than a waste of time...",False

"""Grand Theft Auto V: My Second Life as a Digital Daredevil""  Rating: ★★★★★  Grand Theft Auto V, the game where I've discovered my alter ego as a digital daredevil. Move over, Evel Knievel, I've got a rocket-propelled motorcycle and a thirst for mayhem!  Pros:  - I've learned that in Los Santos, the traffic lights are mere suggestions. Green, red, or blue, I'll drive through them all - and sometimes even the buildings! - The game's pedestrians have a unique way of coping with chaos. They'll scream, curse, and sometimes even join me in my criminal escapades, like they've been waiting for a chance to break bad. - I've become a fashion icon. Whether I'm sporting a tuxedo while robbing a bank or a Hawaiian shirt while parachuting from a helicopter, I'm always dressed for success. - GTA V has taught me that versatility is key. One minute, I'm a mastermind heist planner, the next, I'm a stuntman extraordinaire, and then I'm just a guy trying to play golf in the middle of a gang war.  Cons:  - My sense of traffic rules is a bit skewed in the real world now. My passengers aren't thrilled when I try to reenact my highway adventures. - My friends and I have turned every online session into a chaotic competition. Who can survive the longest with a 5-star wanted level? Who can jump a motorcycle over the most rooftops? The winner gets bragging rights, but everyone else ends up in the hospital. - I've developed a habit of looking for hidden packages in real life, hoping to stumble upon a stash of cash or a shiny weapon upgrade. So far, no luck. - GTA V has ruined my ability to watch a movie without considering how much chaos I can cause with a helicopter in that same scenario.  Grand Theft Auto V is a digital playground where you can embrace your inner outlaw, explore a sprawling virtual city, and create the most insane stories with friends. It's the kind of game where you'll start a mission but end up in a completely unrelated adventure, like skydiving into a military base just for kicks.  To those considering a visit to this virtual world: Buckle up, enjoy the madness, and remember that in GTA V, the only limit is your imagination, and the occasional rocket launcher.  In conclusion, GTA V is where I've learned that sometimes, life's best moments happen when you drive off the beaten path... literally.  Overall rating: ★★★★★",True
Its aged horrifically,False
"Don't fund Rockstar.  I love the GTA series, but I hate Rockstar. Rockstar ain't what it used to be, all the good people left and now it is one big corporate scam. Like you can see online, all multiplayer services are terrible and compromised too. In such manner that people, like me, and millions of others, can see where you life with a single click. You don't have to be an expert, with 30$ and one google search you too can be a scummy ""hacker""  Rockstar always cuts down on their spending, keeping only the worst possible solutions (anti cheat, if you can call it that..) while they knowingly scam a majority of minors with their shark cards, crappy dlc's and casino tricks which get people (mainly minors as the demographic show, which they also have btw) to return for their scummy digital currency which is absolutely worthless.  Trainers are cheap and widely available, don't waste your time grinding a game that is held in low to no regard by it's developers.  My main problem is that I can no longer play and Rockstar ""support"" which are a bunch of nobodies stuck in a office, no braining responses, decided that they can't solve the problem they caused but also refuse to properly read or trace back conversations that took place within 12 hours of time.  The launcher was once again ""updated"" and I am now locked out ""Can you please login manually"" to an email that has ""@1*3.com"" in it, like I know a mail provider or service which provides such a strange string as email address. Clearly this is generated, they linked it, it is their fault, their responsibility and they give f*ck all.  1. I don't know this email 2. I have not been hacked, social club and steam are linked by rockstar, that is the only thing that happened. 3. If I can't access a rockstar generated email and they refuse to provide support, which they have then I am locked out of my game, which I payed for and legally should have access too.  The repercussions taken here should be: 1. Steam should monitor unfair and illegal actions from companies towards their client base 2. Rockstar should treat their costumers like people and not like trash or robots   Rockstar, Sam Houser, Take-Two Interactive, Strauss Zelnick, from the deepest point in my heart, f*ck you and everything you think you stand for. I will never buy GTA 6 which was rightfully leaked because you have a team of evil d*pshit devs.",False

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) stands as a true masterpiece of open-world gaming, and it's not hard to see why. Rockstar Games has crafted an experience that delivers on every front, from its expansive open world to its captivating characters and engaging gameplay.  One of GTA V's most striking features is the sprawling, beautifully detailed city of Los Santos. The level of realism and attention to detail is nothing short of astonishing. Whether you're cruising down the busy streets, exploring the gritty neighborhoods, or soaring over the stunning landscape in an aircraft, the world feels alive and dynamic. The diversity of environments, from the urban jungle to the tranquil countryside, adds to the game's immersive quality.  But it's not just about the world; it's the people who inhabit it that make GTA V shine. The game's three protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—are incredibly well-developed and offer distinct personalities and backgrounds. Their intertwining stories create a narrative that's engaging and full of memorable moments. The voice acting is top-notch, making these characters feel like real people with their quirks and flaws.  The sheer variety of activities and missions is staggering. From high-octane heists that require meticulous planning to offbeat side missions that can range from absurd to touching, GTA V keeps you constantly entertained. The game never forces you down a linear path, allowing you to explore at your own pace and choose how you want to tackle missions.",True
Has anyone encountered this issue? plz help!  So whenever i start my gta 5 i come in to the loading screen and as soon its loaded i come in a public session my game shuts off and i come back to steam.  Please help Gta is one of my favorite games to play Plz help...,True
"This game fucking sucks lol.  Between a billion game breaking bugs, everything constantly crashing, horrendous enemy balancing, and some absolutely dogshit players, I should not like GTA V.  But good lord is it fun.   Playing this game (with friends) is an absolutely ridiculous, stupid, and fun experience. In between productive segments, things almost always break down into inter-group mayhem and it's the funniest thing every single time. No other game allows me to finish a mission with friends and then immediately send them flying cross-map with the ass end of my car.   Also just, really good for putting on a podcast and keeping your hands busy for a few hours. Hell, that makes up about half of the hours I do have.   overall, this game is not good, but it's fun, and I can absolutely recommend it for its now miniscule price.",True

"I just wanted to share with you all my experience playing GTA V. It's one of the most immersive and entertaining games I've ever played! The attention to detail in the open world is incredible, and the story is both compelling and engaging.  I love how much freedom there is in the game - I can choose how to complete missions and what activities to engage in, and there's always something new to discover. The game's graphics and animations are top-notch, and the driving and shooting mechanics feel very smooth and satisfying.  I've also spent a ton of time exploring the vast multiplayer mode with my friends, which has been an absolute blast. We've tried out all the different game modes available and have had so much fun messing around in the open world with our custom characters.  As a gamer, I can confidently say that GTA V is one of the best games out there right now, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone reading this.

"I've played GTA5 a LOT.  It's fun.  Story is great and challenging. Online play can be a lot of fun with friends, but there are a LOT of other players that just ruin it.  Hacking is a major problem that rockstar won't do anything about.  Nothin is more frustrating than trying to do an open session story mission then having some invincible prick teleport next to you and blow up you and your objective, just for you to have to start it all over again.  There is a work around that get you into and empty session, which is great if you are going about it all solo, but it's not a great work around if you are trying to play with friends.  I think only the delivery missions can't be done in a private (crew, friends, or invite only) session, so that helps a little.",False

"This port of the game really has trouble on PC especially with newer hardware (like RTX 3060 and I7-10) I have gone through a bunch of videos and websites explaining how to prevent the countless crashing I experienced, which unfortunately seems pretty common. I changed & updated everything that was talked about on the computer and in game. I even downloaded FPS optimization packs that are reported to help with the initialization error crashes. There were two types of crashes. Initialization errors that are tied to the graphics cards (reportedly) and full crashes without error that just sent me back to steam.   I powered my way through the campaign and lost track of the ""fixes"" that I had to do that were overall unsuccessful. I am now uninstalling the game and not touching it again. I find it frustrating and disappointing that such a popular game has such a bad PC port and that it is up to the community to try and fix and optimize the game. I mean Rockstar are the same people that charge $50 for a red dead 1 port when recent full remakes of games have been an average of $40. Why should I expect for them to manage one of their biggest sources of profit when the fans are doing it for them...",False

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is nothing short of a gaming phenomenon, and it's easy to see why. Rockstar Games has crafted an open-world masterpiece that continues to captivate players worldwide. Here's why I can't stop praising this game:  First and foremost, the open-world of Los Santos is an absolute marvel. It's vast, diverse, and teeming with life. From the bustling streets of downtown to the serene beauty of Blaine County's wilderness, every inch of this world feels meticulously designed and alive. Whether you're driving like a maniac, flying high above the city, or exploring off the beaten path, there's always something exciting to discover.  The story is another highlight. With three playable protagonists, each with their own unique personality and motivations, GTA V offers a narrative experience unlike any other in the series. The characters are brilliantly written, and the voice acting is top-notch, bringing them to life in a way that makes you genuinely care about their fates. The heists, in particular, are thrilling and masterfully executed, providing some of the most memorable moments in gaming.  The freedom GTA V offers is staggering. You can choose to follow the main story, embark on countless side missions, or simply wreak havoc in the city. The variety of activities is mind-boggling, from adrenaline-pumping car chases to leisurely rounds of golf. The sense of immersion is unparalleled, thanks to the attention to detail in every aspect of the game.  Speaking of detail, the graphics are a testament to Rockstar's dedication to creating a visually stunning experience. Even years after its initial release, GTA V continues to impress with its realistic lighting, weather effects, and meticulously crafted environments. It's a game that looks and feels ahead of its time.  GTA Online adds even more longevity to this already massive game. The multiplayer mode allows you to create your own criminal empire, participate in heists with friends, and engage in a wide range of activities in the ever-expanding online world of Los Santos. The constant updates and additions from Rockstar keep the online experience fresh and exciting.  The soundtrack is legendary, featuring a diverse range of music across various radio stations. Whether you're into classic rock, hip-hop, or electronic beats, you'll find something that suits your taste, enhancing the atmosphere of the game.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a triumph of open-world game design, storytelling, and sheer fun. It's a game that continues to evolve and impress, even years after its release. If you haven't experienced the chaos, thrills, and adventure of Los Santos, there's no better time than now. Jump into this virtual playground, and get ready for a wild, unforgettable ride!",True

"Grand Theft Auto V? More like Grind Fest Auto V.  Okay, I'd be lying if I said I haven't been enjoying the new content that's been added since the last time I played GTA Online 5 years ago, but the sheer amount of grinding you have to do to buy anything due to everything being priced ridiculously high now is insane. Like, you need to have a ton of money before you can a buy a business so can make enough money to be able to afford to buy stuff. Also, no fun to be had in public lobbies as they're still plagued by griefers, so I've only been playing in invite only lobbies, essentially playing GTA Online as a single player game. If you're thinking about buying the game in 2023 and starting from rank 1 in Online, don't bother.   Obviously this is a review of GTA Online. I don't think anyone is buying GTA V for the single player story anymore.",False

GOD TEIR GAME,True
"REASONS WHY GTA V IS NOT FUN  NO 1: MANGOTHEORY Mangotheory is a bot that happens to join the lobby and ruin the experience for everyone. When it joins, the avatar stand still as if AFK with godmode (allowing it to be uninterrupted with re-spawning) and starts to promote their MONEY/XP and Unlock glitches in the public chat. they then promote their discord channel for you to join to acquire cheats. This has been confirmed to be a bot by many players I've spoken to in the chat.   NO 2: Real Cheaters Unlike Mangotheory (a bot), you can encounter many real people who have found a way to bring a cheat engine into the public lobbies. These players have many abilities to screw over the players in the game. Ability 1: Godmode  Godmode make the player impossible to kill, giving them the advantage to follow you around and kill your avatar anytime they feel like it, making it impossible to have fun with others who a trying to enjoy the game. Ability 2: Teleportation  Teleportation remove the need to chase down another player when trolling. Everytime I've tried to escape a cheater would just teleport right next to me and kill me. This Teleportation cheats is so bad that it even allows cheaters to enter a your apartment (in-game), meaning that even the safe zones aren't protected. Ability 3: Messing with your Avatar  I've only played this game for a short time but have already lost count of the amount of times my character has been killed out of the blue without any warning. Cheaters can essentially nuke a public lobby, killing all present players simultaneously, which would just lead to an argument in the chat. one time i ran into a cheater that made everyone in the lobby slowly levitate into the sky and then dropping us to our deaths and even after re-spawning you would go back to levitating forcing everyone to leave and join another lobby. Ability 4: Server Wide Kicking  When a cheater happen to get in an argument with an actual player, it always ends with the cheater kicking everyone from the public lobby and sending us to a solo lobby, which makes the player having to go through the hassle of joining another public lobby to interact with players again. Ability 5: Messing with level and money Within my first 10 minutes of playing GTA V Online i was learning all the basics of what i can do and how to do it (Tutorial). When i was given the chance to finally free roam the GTA V world and do as i please, my screen was filled with notifications saying I've collected 10/10 collectable/secrat cash. This gave my player $1M of in-game currency and my level jumped from 1-30 in an instant allowing me to unlock the achievement  ""reach rank 25"". When i had a look at the chat it was one cheater saying your welcome and then leaving the game after promoting where and how to get the hacks. This took away the fun for grinding for money and items if they were this easy to obtain with cheats.   NO 3: Public Lobbies When i bought GTA V i was expecting to run into a couple of bad apples or sweats who player the game seriously, mixed in with a couple of nice players who would make it fun. but in order to have any fun with the online aspect of GTA V you would have to either play with friends on in a crew only session or find any discord servers which promotes a private server to join without cheaters.  NO 4. Anti-Cheat This is my first time playing GTA V online and I've never experienced a game with a terrible anti-cheat system. Until  I see that Rockstar has introduced and implemented a functional anti-cheat system.  Thanks for your co-operation  Sab",False

"Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V is a massive open-world action game that offers an incredible amount of freedom to explore the vast city of Los Santos and surrounding countryside. After its initial release in 2013, it still holds up well nearly a decade later as one of the most ambitious and entertaining open world games ever created.  GTA V allows you to play as three different protagonists - Michael, Franklin and Trevor. Each character has their own skillsets and special abilities, and you can switch between them at will. This gives you a lot of strategic options during missions and allows you to see the story from different perspectives.  The sprawling open world is packed with details that make Los Santos feel like a living, breathing city. There are countless vehicles to drive, stunt jumps to make, random events to discover and side activities like tennis, golf and scuba diving. The amount of content is almost overwhelming.  Missions provide plenty of over-the-top action, from large scale heists to street races and shootouts. Gunplay feels impactful and driving mechanics are smooth. Even mundane activities like customizing cars is enjoyable thanks to the level of depth and options.  With amazing writing, voice acting and character development, GTA V's story and satire of Southern California life is entertaining from start to finish. Though some themes and humor haven't aged perfectly, it's an engaging crime story fueled by greed and a memorable cast of characters.  GTA Online has kept the experience feeling fresh for years with new modes and content updates. It does have some repetitive grind, but playing and wreaking havoc with friends is a total blast.  Some gameplay and graphics elements feel a bit dated now, but GTA V remains one of the most impressive open world experiences out there. The incredible attention to detail paired with exciting action and dark humor makes this a crime saga not to be missed.",True

"Well, as a fan of GTA games, I can say that GTA V is a good game. But the game has four cons for me.    Firstly, I don't like the story of the game. The story of the game is so boring, unlike other GTA games.       Second con is about online. There are many toxic players. Of course many online games have some toxic players. If you want to earn some cash, to play normal, I recommend you to play in private session. And if you want to enjoy online, you need to have friends to play online with them. GTA Online missions are good, can say that better than the story missions.   Third con is about chatting system in online. Sometimes you can see your friend's chat, sometimes can't.    Fourth con is about online again. Well, there were some guns, cars in the game, but then Rockstar removed them from the game, that's why I think that older players have more advantage about that things which I mentioned.  Edit: Rockstar fixed third and fourth problems. Well done",True

"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",True

"Bro Stop Already. I got the pre-order edition in 2013 and this game died at the introduction of flying vehicles. With over 8000 hours across 3 platforms I can confidently say this game is dead. Any online lobby is god mode hackers while innocent people get banned for in game currency. Sam & Dan Houser were the soul of this company and shortly after they left we all saw in front of our eyes their transformation into Rockisoft. We can all agree how underwhelming and outright lazy the RDR1 port was. Any good titles like RDR2 Online get shut down to focus on a 1/2 decade old dying game all in the name of $, good old R* milking their fans relentlessly. Hello Games & Facepunch are the some of the only major devs rn that actually care about their game and treat their players like playerss instead of money bags. Buying everyting in GTA Online costs about 900 Million ingame $ which is roughly $9000 USD or 2 YEARS of playtime.    TLDR:  * DEAD GAME * Rockisoft is not the same after losing Sam & Dan Houser. * Absolutely despise their fanbase and transformed into sellouts.

"Since Rockstar has made it impossible for me to get in touch with them privately. I'll post this on every public forum until they respond.  In regard to your previous e-mail  Dearest Rockstar Games,  I hope this email finds you well. This is a response to the pleasant email you sent me 2 days ago in regards to my suspension. Now this is not an appeal, this is not me begging to lift my suspension. This is going to be a me, an innocent bystander, flipping your entire organization from CEO Strauss Zelnick to the janitor whose name I hope is Joey, the biggest of middle fingers. I have not played GTA V since June 22nd, 2023, or the day they discovered the OceanGate Titan wreckage. Now I know the suspension is not from the sub-nautical nonsense I may have or may have not partaken in the day the wreckage was discovered, because that would just be silly now would it. I do not know the details as to why I have been suspended and my progress reset, for at this portion of our debacle is an unknown allegation. During a brief investigation into what could possibly warrant my suspension, unless my account was hacked, there is no need for the suspension. I do not believe my suspension is just and warranted for outside tomfoolery. This may come as a shock to you, but as I investigate these bold allegations, I will be placing you on an unpaid indefinite suspension from my valuable time. I also regret to inform you that this a final decision and cannot be appealed. I will also tell 2 friends of how poorly you handled this situation. They will in turn tell 2 friend who each will tell 2 friends. If that chain continues, it will be a very bad and sad look for Rockstar games.

An event for the 10th annivers- wait, 10th?! 10 years this game has been milked, now, I'll say they did make Red Dead Redemption 2 (an absolute masterpiece in my opinion), but weapon skins for 2 guns people never use and the rpg, plus 3 outfits and at most like $30k in ammo, armor, and snacks.  Recently I've been playing GTA IV, and while it feels slightly dated with some mission designs, it just feels built to last better than this multi-billion dollar buncha garbage. If I were to give my suggestion? Don't get this game again, even if you want to play it.

"GTA V Review  Review is after completing the main story missions, all side missions, finding all collectibles, clearing the entire map and achieving 100% completion on single player mode. As a side note: never cared for multiplayer. [hr][/hr]   [b]Story[/b] My favorite GTA game was San Andreas. After playing this game, my favorite GTA game is San Andreas. Yes, that didn’t change. It’s hard to compete against Carl Johnson’s version of the hero's journey. Having said that GTA V is an absolute gem in a caliber of its own. A diamond of a game. I highly encourage gamers to 100% the single player aspect of the game. As you explore the game to find all collectibles you will see just how much detail developers integrated into this world. Also Space Docker is the ultimate vehicle in the game!   [b]Gameplay[/b] Took me a while to figure out how to do the knife flights correctly for the achievement. Other than that, the remainder of the gameplay was superb. I was; however, jealous of all the cool vehicles and weapons the developer implemented in GTA Online.   [b]Graphics[/b] On a league of their own considering how detailed the world is. The only benchmark they need to surpass for the next game is their own.   [b]Controls[/b] Played on PC with mouse and keyboard. Gameplay and gunplay was smooth and responsive.    [b]Side Missions[/b] Completed all of them. I had to, you see, because they were all so good.   [b]Music/Soundtrack/Voice[/b] Excellent curated selection of songs as usual. Voice acting from all 3 main characters was at peak quality.   [b]Performance[/b] Experienced no crashes and the game ran smoothly on my PC (which is a mid-range PC). It did not cause undue heating of the CPU and GPU.

"Been playing GTA V pretty much since it came out on the 360. i literally just started over on PC with all new Online character and everything. Unfortunately it didn't take me very long to discover that hackers are still around and worse than ever. About 15 minutes ago (before writing this) someone decided to hack my online character and forced my progress up for rank 9 to rank 30, gave me a boat load of money, and then forced all the unlocks for me. now i am afraid i cant play AT ALL without being banned, i didn't consent to any of that and now my game is ruined. I didn't do anything wrong and yet now I'm the one that gets screwed. I managed to contact support but all they gave me was some bs about ""routine sweeps"" for hackers and suspicious game play. I have no idea how long that is going to take, or if their ""sweep"" is actually gonna fix my character or just take the false money.",False

"Rating: ★★★★★  I've had the immense pleasure of diving into the world of Grand Theft Auto V for the past five months, and I can confidently say that this game is nothing short of a modern gaming masterpiece. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this open-world epic, delivering an experience that sets the bar for open-world action-adventure games.  Graphics and Visuals (★★★★★): From the moment I stepped into the fictional city of Los Santos, I was awestruck by its breathtaking visuals. The attention to detail is astonishing, with stunningly realistic character models, lifelike environments, and a day-night cycle that adds depth and immersion to the world. Even after months of gameplay, I still find myself stopping to admire the sunrise over the city or the reflections in the rain-soaked streets.  Gameplay and Mechanics (★★★★★): GTA V seamlessly blends a gripping narrative with an open-world playground that encourages exploration and experimentation. The three playable protagonists, Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, each bring their unique personalities and skills to the table, making for a diverse and dynamic gameplay experience. The controls are intuitive, and the variety of vehicles, weapons, and activities at your disposal ensures that boredom is a foreign concept in this game.  Storyline and Characters (★★★★★): The narrative in GTA V is an absolute triumph. It's not just a crime caper; it's a thought-provoking exploration of the American Dream, ambition, and morality. The three protagonists' intertwined stories provide a refreshing perspective on the criminal underworld, and the supporting cast of characters is as memorable as they are unpredictable. The sharp writing and superb voice acting elevate the storytelling to new heights.  Multiplayer (★★★★★): Grand Theft Auto Online adds another layer of enjoyment to the game. Whether you're racing with friends, tackling heists, or simply causing mayhem in the vast open world, the multiplayer mode extends the game's longevity indefinitely. Frequent updates and a thriving online community ensure that there's always something new to discover.  Conclusion: Grand Theft Auto V is an enduring gem in the world of video games. Five months into my journey, I'm still finding new things to do, new secrets to uncover, and new ways to be amazed by the sheer scale and detail of Los Santos. This game represents a high watermark for the industry and is a must-play for any gamer. Rockstar Games' commitment to quality is evident in every pixel, and the result is nothing short of breathtaking. Five months in, and I can confidently say that GTA V is the best game I've ever played. If you haven't experienced it yet, do yourself a favor and dive into this open-world masterpiece. You won't be disappointed.",True

"side note : i've played this game since launch, on & off on PS, always been a fan. i recently built a new pc and wanted to see how GTA 5 was on M & K.. game is just as great as it is/was compared to my play time on console, although it is quite easy to get burned out on quickly, due to game-play, missions or otherwise... it'll always be a good addition to your library, especially if you have some time to kill and just wanna bs.  RECOMMENDATION : in my 10 hours of play time on PC I've noticed that pretty much every session is filled with someone modding... as well as for EVERY single free-mode session I've joined, there WILL always be a modder  that joins session and spams the super loud explosion BS, for which someone kicks them, only for them to re-join and do the same repetitive BS time and time again or; another will join under a diff name and so same thing.  most amount of koins and kicks ive seen in my 10 hours, was 13 joiners in 30 mins (causing loud jump scares) and getting kicked within 10-20 secs   it almost seems like you need to run a mod menu just to deter the BS other people with the menus pull, which is obnoxiously ignorant. which honestly just adds to the burnout factor.. so far I've just stuck to playing missions once the super loud jump scares start or playing something else entirely..  great job, R*",True

"Grand Theft Auto V is the most realistic life simulator I've ever played. Forget about those boring ""sims"" games where you make friends, build houses, and go to work. In GTA V, you can do it all – and then some!  Pros:  Excellent traffic AI: NPCs drive as if they're on a mission to reenact every action movie car chase. Realistic economics: Who knew a life of crime could be so profitable? Just don't ask me how I got that yacht. Endless entertainment: From playing golf to parachuting off Mount Chiliad, there's something for everyone. ""Trevor Philips Industries"" – the only workplace that never gets old. Cons:  Terrible road rage: It's hard to maintain my zen-like calm when my fellow motorists are trying to recreate the next Fast & Furious movie on the freeway. Clothes shopping addiction: My character spends more on clothes than I do in real life, and I'm not even mad about it. Overall, if you've ever wondered what it's like to be a stunt driver, a skydiving pro, a billionaire playboy, or a criminal mastermind, this game has got you covered. Just be prepared to lose track of time and your moral compass. I've been a criminal, but I've never been so law-abiding in my life – in a video game, of course!  Remember, it's all in good fun, and the virtual world of GTA V is a riot. Just try not to get too carried away, or you might find yourself on the wrong side of the law in real life too!",True

bro i have spent 1.5 hours just trying to get in the game but it says my code is already being used,True
game is good but the one flaw i have is that when i got the premium version of gtav i also got the Criminal Enterprise pack DLC where i should have gotten a lot of stuff but i didnt it doesnt say that i own it in game and when i go to it in game it says buy but if i go to the steam store page it says that i have it in my library. So in other words rockstar scamed me out of my starter pack and i dont know how to fix the issue/problem. If anyone knows a solution lmk in the reply's.  Have a Great day  -GhostWo1f,True

"I'm an Italian gamer and this review was written entirely with Google Translate. I would like to start this review by saying that despite the one star review I love Rockstar products and above all I love GTA V, I have all of Benny's custom cars and 40 other vehicles, I have never had any problems and in fact I have also made purchases to go forward and I don't want to cheat, but I have to say I feel cheated about something that happened. I switch from PS4 to PC and buy GTA, I try to recover the account but I can't and after two days I search on Google and find it written that it cannot be done, which I find absurd given the possibility of cross play. I don't demand a refund but I do demand that a game like GTA V has the ability to transfer accounts from PS4 to PC. I know maybe my review won't mean much to you but I hope you will read it and give a fan the chance to play their favorite game on PC",True

"RockStar Social Club is criminal.  Stop doing this for the single player experience.  I get it for multiplayer and the like.  But your spyware programs are annoying.  Coming back to play after years of inactivity to have a little fun and the game is unplayable until solving riddles of password protections and linking accounts to play a little quiet game.  After years of online and connective play this billion dollar industry have not figured a better system for ad revenues and generating commercial aspects in a user friendly way. Gamers could never come up with boycott big enough to trash these companies because the game design is excellent and the gameplay is fun, but I certainly wish there would be a proactive effort by these AAA studios in delivering a solution to these grand marketing schemes. So I will instead, waste my efforts in this ridiculous post as if screaming at a hurricane.  Time that I could have been playing your most excellent game is now put off for the several days that I must wait for a little email so I can attempt a password reset for something I set years ago.  For those people currently promoting your damn Social Club I hope your life allows that you feel sorry for your actions and the shame of this might drive you towards a change in behavior.    For those still reading this stupid post I hope you find some purpose in life that avoids these machinations that pound us slowly into the deep void of reality.",True

"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.",True

"Not able to log into the spyware that is Rockstar Social using my credentials, so I'm prevented from even starting the game. Adding insult to injury, when trying to log into Rockstar's web to see what's going on... to change my password or anything, I'm required to solve... Extremely!!! irritating and time consuming verification puzzles in which I'm required to sum in my head several (hard to see) dice up to 14, mixing both dots and numerals, and choose the correct picture among many others which total 13 or 15 each. Just imagine yourself counting six groups of dice succesfully, like this... not once or twice, but ten times, spending minutes and minutes on the task, only to either find out you made a mistake so you have to start all over, or see that nothing happens and you still can't restore the account or access the game.

"This has got to be the most sucked off game ever. There is no reason this game should be as popular as it is. Almost everything about this game is bad. The controls are so confusing is makes you feel like a toddler who has just been told to pilot an F22 raptor. Like why the fuck would middle mouse button open the menu. The loading time is so unreasonably long is makes you wonder if they just make it load for that long to mess with their players. The game play is mid at best, like there are so many other options for games you could play with the same if not better features. And one of the main selling points of the game, the heists, are utter filth found from the deepest depths of the filthiest dump. You spend 45 minutes setting it up just only for one civilian to catch a stray and make you lose all your progress and end up making $20. The game also takes up a whopping 100 gigabytes and, as expected for the size, takes forever yo re install. It is also so poorly optimized on steam, you have to make a social club account and if you forget that password then it's just over for you I guess because the password resetting website crashed every time you enter a new password. Only after you do some stupid extra thing you shouldn't have to do you can then reset your password. And don't even get me started on how hard it is to make money. you feel like you are making good progress and then you realize that the cheapest non shit car is over 1 million dollars. plus, for some vehicles, you need special garages to even buy some of the better things. Ever wonder why this game goes on sale for so cheap. The only reason I play this game is because my dumb ass friends keep asking me to play it. I would much rather do unpaid work than play this game. For anyone who is considering buying this game who hasn't gotten it yet and for those who are considering re installing it, don't.",False

"So I waited for almost ten years, never played or watched, denying this part of grand theft auto, thinking that it’s worse than IV, just to come to this very moment and say it was right thing to do, it’s that poor. In every aspect perhaps except satire. I quickly got tired of constant raised voice shoutings, this mid-life crisis drama sucked out of thumb, idiotic unstable characters, total cringe, annoying npcs and cops, pseudo gangsta shi*t, lame choice of music, boring ? sign missions, limit of actions in the world, clumsiness of character and vehicles, zero guns feeling, lame sound design, money grinding, narco missions - ahahah look he’s high, we should get high too and play G T A yeaaaaah, and i’m not saying anything about online mode. Fu*k that sh*t. Fourth part is much better than this LA blunt disaster. Also it was absolutely brain dead decision to put Johnny from the Lost and Damned on the sacrifice altar in order to show me truly emotional and troubled side of proto hipster.",False
"The game is perfect! It is a masterpiece of a open world design. The only problem is the time you have to wait to play the game. Sometimes I spend 15min just sitting and waiting while the game loaded. Each time when I want to play I think twice if I have enough time to wait. I read topics on forum and revealed that it is a common problem, and Rockstar don't want to fix it. Today I waited again for 15 mins looking at a rolling wheel, and just closed the game without playing it. It is sad.",True

"The game suffered from a real stagnation over all those pvp horrible mechanics, futuristic vehicles being added and much much more. Now it got way better on grinding and it would be great if it wasn't for the cheaters and modders. Not that I'm against on adding money to your account or messing around with friends or even randoms but we all know that most of modders only grief and destroy other people's cargo. Imagine grinding or waiting for a full bunker and watching it all being destroyed by a modder who just orb'd everyone in the lobby. If you bought the supplies you just lost $300k but if you grinded for supply missions you just lost 3 hours of your time playing the game. I'm not saying that you couldn't have known the risk of selling in public lobbies but at this point you are always griefed by modders and if you don't sell in public not only you are losing profit that allows you to buy more stuff and enjoy the game but also you'll find yourself playing all alone as if it was singleplayer with more content.   This game ask players to cheat because no one will grind all their lifes to get an Opel Corsa or even spend 1500€ just to buy everything they want and not worry about grinding. I would grind if it wasn't for modders and I prefere the pc version just for the option of playing with more than 60 fps and with mouse and keyboard.  If you will ban players at least ban the ones messing up with your game everyday just griefing and killing everyone. It's not even a legitimate tactic to grief it's against the rules!   Part 2:  The latest DLC is the worst so far. Took out more content that it added.  The missions are basic except for ""On Parade"" which gave me a cool challenge actually. There's no story at all, we don't have any cutscenes and the side characters only speak to us on the missions, we never see Charlie at all.  I would actually pay at least 5€ just to play a good DLC or 15€ for all the things half priced. Instead you just make players to pay 6-8 Million dollars to buy an avenger or 1.5M just for the upgrade and what do you get? 350k. Come on.",False

"Title: Grand Theft Auto V - An Epic Experience Marred by Load Times, Cheaters, and Glitches  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is undoubtedly a modern gaming masterpiece that delivers an exhilarating open-world experience like no other. From the sprawling city of Los Santos to the captivating narratives of its three protagonists, this game is an action-packed adventure that has set a new standard in the gaming industry. However, amidst the praise, there are some significant drawbacks that need addressing.  First and foremost, GTA V's open-world is an absolute triumph. The attention to detail in recreating Los Angeles is awe-inspiring, and the sheer size of the map is mind-boggling. Exploring this virtual world is a true joy, with an abundance of side activities, missions, and random encounters that keep players engaged for hours on end.  The characters are brilliantly written and performed, with Michael, Franklin, and Trevor each bringing their unique charm and complexity to the story. The narrative is a rollercoaster ride filled with memorable moments and unexpected twists, making it one of the best in the series.  The game's visuals are stunning, especially on more powerful hardware. The attention to detail in the environment, character models, and vehicle designs is nothing short of remarkable. The soundtrack perfectly complements the atmosphere, featuring an eclectic mix of music that suits every mood.  However, the experience takes a hit when it comes to load times. It's baffling that even on high-end systems, players often find themselves staring at loading screens for what feels like an eternity. This issue disrupts the otherwise immersive experience and can be incredibly frustrating, especially when transitioning between story missions and online play.  Speaking of online play, GTA Online has its share of problems. The presence of cheaters and hackers in online lobbies has plagued the game since its inception. It's disheartening to see players exploit the game's mechanics to gain an unfair advantage, ruining the experience for others. Rockstar's efforts to combat these issues have been inconsistent at best, leaving legitimate players to suffer the consequences.  Furthermore, frequent glitches and bugs continue to mar the GTA V experience. These can range from minor inconveniences like mission markers disappearing to game-breaking issues that force players to restart missions or even the entire game. It's frustrating to encounter these problems in a game that has been on the market for years and has received numerous updates.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains a gaming masterpiece that deserves praise for its open-world design, storytelling, and attention to detail. However, the long load times, persistent issues with cheaters in online lobbies, and frequent glitches detract from what could be a flawless experience. While it's certainly worth playing for its strengths, it's disheartening to see these issues persist in a game of such high caliber. Rockstar Games should prioritize addressing these concerns to ensure that GTA V continues to shine as one of the greatest open-world games of all time.",True

I put up with it before, for both GTAV and RDR2, but I'm done dealing with it for both.  I realize I ""only have to provide it once"" (unless *their* shit fucks up, of course), but I *shouldn't* have to provide it fucking ever.

"I wish there was a way to review the single player and multiplayer separately. The single player is missing lots of things that you expect from a modern title, mostly because the single player is about 10 years old at this point (literally 9 days away from a 10 year anniversary as I write this). But otherwise, the single player game is about everything you've come to expect from a great developer like Rockstar. The multiplayer game is about everything you expect from an absolutely scumbag horrible publisher like TakeTwo Interactive. The multiplayer is bugged as shit, has almost no incentive to play, filled with griefers and hackers (oh sorry, 'modders'), is 10 years old and TakeTwo have literally said they don't want you playing their game if you don't buy shark cards. I'm just going to go ahead and say: don't buy this game. Even for the single player, its a bit old and there are better single player games out these days (i.e. Witcher 3, Fallout, etc). The multiplayer is a horrendous piece of dog shit that is so obviously tacked on by TakeTwo as a way to try to milk this game for all the money they can get so they don't have to fund a new GTA game for as long as possible.  The real takeaway from GTA5 should really be that you should be extremely wary of GTA6. I'm sure Rockstar will do an absolutely amazing job on developing the game and the single player campaign, but TakeTwo is going to ruin it like they do everything else. Hell, look at the state of KSP2 - that is TakeTwo really pushing that game into early access before it's ready.  And remember TakeTwo wanted to shut down ALL mods for KSP1. TakeTwo is a horrendous piece of shit publisher right up there with the likes of Electronic Arts, but doesn't get quite the flak that Electronic Arts gets because TakeTwo mostly works on things that aren't quite as mainstream for PC, or for things that are mostly console titles like GTA.  Avoid GTA5, and I'd avoid buying GTA6 until well after release when it starts going on sale (maybe not even then - let's see the reviews first...)",False

"This game is a great game that is ruined by a useless and greedy dev. My friend recently had his social club account hacked and his information changed. Despite many attempts to prove his identity to Rockstar including receipts, screenshots and video evidence they have refused to validate his identity. He has 1000 hours in this game and they are willing to treat him this way. I can safely say I will not be buying GTA 6 if you know what I mean 🏴‍☠️ Fuck Rockstar.  I know this won't do anything but I am pissed at Rockstar and want to warn others to ensure their accounts are extremely secured lest it happen to you.   ***UPDATE***  After 2 weeks and 6 support tickets he finally got them to realise he was him, so I guess good job Rockstar? 6/10",False

Unplayable garbage without downloading 3rd party software and joining a specific community to play with. All online lobbies are plagued with hackers and modders that exist only to advertise services for sale or grief everyone.

They simply don't even try.,False

Just leaving my 420 hour review.,True
Rockstar has done nothing to address the modder problems that are well known on PC (Almost every GTAO lobby).   - You can have your account banned remotely by a modder - You can have funds removed from your account by a modder - Invite only lobbies / closed lobbies don't help you as they are even able to kill you in SINGLEPLAYER! - They can teleport you / everyone around the map at will and kill you at will - They can make you stumble in an endless loop so that you aren't able to move - The mods that they are using potentially go further than GTA and can be used to penetrate your PC  A firewall is a potential way to protect yourself but it doesn't make you invulnerable to these exploits This game has been out for 10 years and these problems still persist if you choose to play GTAV you're doing so at your own risk as this has spawn an environment for people to exploit without consequences.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXuLZ5tvQlY&ab_channel=TheProfessional,False

best realistic game ever,True
Online has a lot of cheaters on PC and connection issues severs can be shaky at times and the load times increase do to this but if you can learn to deal with it i do recommend this game Rockstar honestly gave it their all and the game can be fun and entertaining . i guess if you play the campaign only you don't have to worry about these issues the story mode is job well done. Every game has its issues i try to think of it that way.,True
Game has a crazy amount of options of things to do...but it is rather buggy and many aspects are terrible like flying on PC is god awful. So i find it odd the game is highly against mods when so many mods can fix a lot of quality of life changes. I would love to play online with my friends with some of the quality changes but I worry about getting banned. Unless i am terrorizing a lobby Idk why I cant fast travel across the map instead of waiting 30+ minutes IRL to get to my destination. 3 outta 5,True

"Updated review:  I think they're letting the game sink by choking new players from most profits. You'll probably need at least 100 hours of grind as a new player to get to a ""barely good"" enough state IF you put all your money into businesses. It's going to be a really tedious grind cause you will need 2 heists just to buy ONE CAR. The best profit avenue has been ridiculously nerfed and considering it takes about 1hr to set up and $100k in-game currency just to start setting up, I can no longer justify baring with the tediousness of the best profit avenue on the game.  R* probably just want players to move on to GTA 6 when it comes at this point, so I suggest saving up both your time,and your money and wait for it to come out.  Old review:  ""Ironically enough, the ""Grand Theft Auto"" part fades the longer you play the game cause you'll end up using cars you own and worked hard to pay for anyway. Or not use a car at all.""",False
"I bought the retail version of this game when it first launched. It worked fine with no issue at all for years. Then one day, Rockstar decided to launch their own launcher. All my Rockstar games stopped working, even the ones I had on steam. Since then, I've periodically tried to fix the issue and play GTA V. Tired of not having it work, I decided to buy it on Steam and see if anything changed, although I knew it wouldn't. I've got every error code in the book, I've tried every fix, all the official ones, all the Reddit ones, nothing. This garbage company decided to release their trash garbage launcher and I can't play the games I've payed for. At least I can refund this one. Rockstar, fix your garbage trash launcher no one wants or get rid of it. I only want to play singleplayer, why can't I bypass your garbage trash launcher? I finally decided to let the game run with the error code so I could write a review. This review is all I can do, the quiet echo of my voice will fade into nothingness, while this garbage trash company run by donkeys continues to profit. GTA IV and GTA V, two of my all time favorite games, now forever taken from me because the donkeys running this company wanted to gather more power. Maybe one day it won't be garbage trash anymore. Maybe, one can dream.",False

Fast forward a decade later, you play as a ex-Families Gang member named Franklin Clinton, repoing a car for Simeon Yeterian.  You are eventually tasked to repo a car from a kid named Jimmy De Santa, and sure enough you get a handgun pointed to your dome.  Turns out that man you played as Michael Townley is now Michael De Santa,  who faked his death during the heist to enter a Witness Protection Program.  Smash into the car shop window, Michael pays you for a job well done.  The games event’s then spontaneously kick off from that and propels the plot.        There is a variety of activists to do in Los Santos or Blaine County; such as events, Strangers and Freaks, Activities, and some events get your new heist members for future heists. The gunplay in the game is linear, but smooth and intuitive.  The special abilities the trio have are unique and engaging.  It helps you to have an edge over the various enemies in the world such as the Los Santos Police Department,  the Ballas, etc.  Activities are somewhat repetitive, and boring after a while.  The Strangers and Freaks mission is a mixed bag, some of the characters are fun and engaging;  while others are monotone and annoying.  Tasked with different tasks based on the Stranger you are dealing with and what they want.  The game in my playthrough which is somewhat rushed, but also doing all the events and a quarter of the Strangers and Freaks missions; the entire length of the game took me about 39.2 hours to beat. A felt like a real ride, with a sense of achievement based on the 1 of 3 endings you choose. That will be something you will have to find out in your playthrough.   8.5/10 would strongly recommend this game for it’s single-player experience alone, not so much for online because of the rampant hackers in lobbies.",True

Worst load times by a huge margin in any game ive played or seen. For each time u load somewhere like walking into your house theres a 20% chance it will NEVER load and u will have to alt f4 to restart. Game is made of 10% cheaters who can do anything they want to u and usually have godmode. Starting out is very confusing and doesnt give u any guidance so rely on looking everything up. Any vehicle u will want is incredibly unaffordable and will cost u ur whole bank account which u spent hours doing boring tasks to save up. UI is horrible and keybinds dont make any sense. They different for doing the same thing in different scenarios. Definitely dont waste ur time with this game. Its over 10 years old and it shows. Too much.,False

"I recommend the game for the story mode, which is the quintessential GTA V experience that we've all known for the last 10 years.   This game is probably the most fun driving experience I've had outside of dedicated racing games, and every other game falls short when compared to this one.  HOWEVER ONLINE MODE  As a new player you should be super aware that modders in lobbies are very common. And most have a superiority complex. About 60% of the time it's fine unless you try to get in a fight with one, in which case you will have a bad time, being stuck in a death loop. Best way to avoid that is to just type in chat that you're going to go AFK and stop giving them the satisfaction- they give up super quickly. (or just move to a new lobby of course).  Even ignoring modders- as a new player it's pretty hard to get to the good content- which is all the expensive stuff in the game- this truly is the American dream which Rockstar has made millions from over the last 10 years. I used to play the game on console so I've had an easier time getting used to it however- 90% of modders are selfish, but occasionally you'll get random modders who'll just give you a tonne of XP and money which can help you skip a lot of grinding.  If you ever reach the point you get a lot of items- good cars, guns, apartment etc- it's pretty satisfying.  Online mode is full of modders- usually fine until they decide to grief you- in which case you move to a new lobby. you can still have fun in the game though- there's a lot to do, and sometimes its kinda overwhelming as a new player. if you're lucky a nice modder will just give u money and levels, and then you can actually enjoy the game- it's a slick experience when you have a lot of the stuff- otherwise it's a pain to grind.",True

Singleplayer story is amazing. Have played it multiple times both on consoles and PC. GTA Online has changed for the worse with in my opinion lazy DLC. The grinding nature is not fun. Stupid vehicles like the MK2 opressor which every sweat will use even towards a new level 1 player.  Still doing your daily objectives in GTA Online is quite fun.  If you have never played the story of GTA V before then I highly recommend you doing so.,True

"Forget about what percentage of reviews are positive . . . look at the NUMBER of reviews here. This is a milestone in gaming, and anyone who ""likes video games"" should play it. It's a really good story, and it doesn't get boring at any point. The worst thing about this game is that I can't let my kids play it yet.",True
"Would not let me adjust my brightness to be able to see the game to play in online mode.  You can do this in story mode though?  That's dumb enough for me to not want to play anymore after coming back from a long break.  There is no way to change this in online mode to make the game playable while it is nighttime.  I would have to quit mission, load into story mode, turn it up or down and have to wait for time of day to change to make sure I can SEE???  That is the most asinine thing I have ever had to do to change a setting.  After another hundred hours I've grown tired of the time/money walls.  I cannot complete sell missions without running out of time if I solo.  The rest of the time is spent solely on resupplies.  No other way to make decent money.  Had I known the hangar takes 50 resupply missions to fully stock I would have never bought it.  Takes me so long to generate the millions it took just to see my time spent/money gained go right out the window.  So much so that I uninstalled and will not play this again.    So I played it again...  This time I bought a office so I can be able to buy a warehouse so I would be able to buy a Phantom Wedge.  Turns out that it was not very forthcoming with what I needed to buy in order to unlock the Phantom Wedge. Instead I bought some crate business that requires me to buy the stuff in order to sell?  Also I can't store the truck I want to buy there but instead have to buy yet another worthless to me warehouse in order to store a truck.  So many cash holes to deal with just to be able to buy the stupid truck.  Could not find a single guide online or video explaining this process.  So dumb. I just want to drive a truck with a wedge...  why is this so hard to do?   All in all if you wanna play this game, do the story mode, use hax to get stuff u don't wanna waste time getting and have your fun and move on.",False

"As-salamu alaykum, dear friends and gamers. Allow me to share my thoughts on the captivating world of ""Grand Theft Auto V."" This game, set in the sprawling streets of Los Santos, reminds me of the diverse landscapes and cultures of our Middle Eastern lands, a blend of tradition and modernity.  In ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" players find themselves navigating the intricate web of crime and ambition, much like the stories of ancient civilizations and the great caliphates of the past. The game offers a rich tapestry of characters, each with their own motivations and desires, mirroring the complexities of human nature that have fascinated our scholars for centuries.  The virtual Los Santos, a sprawling metropolis, mirrors the bustling cities of our region, with its towering skyscrapers and crowded streets. The attention to detail in this game is akin to the intricate mosaic work found in our historical mosques, every pixel a testament to the dedication of the creators.  One cannot ignore the exhilarating vehicular chases and heists that form the core of the gameplay. As we navigate the dangerous criminal underbelly of Los Santos, it's as if we are embarking on a thrilling desert caravan journey, braving the elements and facing the unknown. The rush of adrenaline is akin to the heart-pounding feeling one might experience during a challenging pilgrimage to Mecca.  Yet, it is crucial to acknowledge that ""Grand Theft Auto V"" also touches upon the consequences of our actions, a reflection of the teachings of Islam. The choices made by the characters, and by extension, the player, have repercussions that resonate throughout the game's narrative. It serves as a reminder of the importance of ethical conduct and the consequences of one's deeds, in line with our faith's teachings.  The sound design of the game, with its blend of Middle Eastern-inspired music and modern beats, creates a unique atmosphere that resonates with our cultural heritage while immersing us in the world of Los Santos.  However, it is essential to approach ""Grand Theft Auto V"" with a discerning eye and a commitment to the values of Islam. The game does explore themes of violence and criminality, and it is crucial to maintain a sense of balance and responsibility in our interactions with it.  In conclusion, ""Grand Theft Auto V"" is a remarkable experience that, like the tapestry of Islam, weaves together a multitude of elements into a vibrant and engaging whole. It invites us to explore the human condition and navigate the complexities of a dynamic world, reminding us of the ever-evolving nature of our own lives. Approach it with wisdom and reflection, and you may find it to be a thought-provoking journey through the streets of Los Santos. Peace be upon you all.",True

"GTA Games have one thing in common, Its storytelling. And GTA 5's story was great as usual. The graphic, The mechanic, There wasn't much to badmouth. Variety of new cars, And I loved the online. It gave me and others a chance to play with friends and make friends. But just like others, I didn't like it when most of the cars were erased from online shops. But let's get back to story mode, I liked Trevor the most, His character in-depth was amazing, He's cruel but not a psychopath. He loves his mom and values loyalty which is shown in Ending B. When Franklin asks for Trevor's help to kill Michael, Trevor refuses instantly, But when it is Ending A, Michael agrees. It tells that Michael values his family more than anything, He tells it on some occasions as well. And as for Franklin, He's the street man who wants to leave that life behind. (But he just upped the game) From the interactions and everything from these three characters I thought, Trevor was the muscle, Michael was the leader, Franklin was the peacekeeper (Bonus) Lester was the brain. And, There's more to the story than what I explained, Other than just playing the online, I suggest you play the story mode as well. But the most important part in the story (In my own conclusion) Was the three protagonists, They're all in the end doing what they're doing to achieve a better life. And I think I rumbled too long xD",True

I can't even do a race without someone just blowing up my wheels over and over until they finish and can't control it anymore i guess.

"This is not towards Steam or the Actual game itself, This is due to the very horribly integrated ""Social Club"" that has caused me and many others to suffer for what we paid for, Recently had my Social Club account hacked and the hacker linked their email to my Steam purchase of GTA, I have managed to reobtain my account and made sure to activate 2FA so it doesnt happen again but now im stuck waiting on Rockstar support to relink my steam purchase of GTA to my Social Club account so I can even play the game on single player, They do not allow you to play the game without being signed into social club so im stuck with a game I own that I cant play even offline if wanted to and tbh I dont even know if Rockstar will even relink the game to my account so I may just be screwed, guess I will find out within the next week or so whenever they decide to get back to me",False

"If you buy this game at 2023, it's still worth the money. Why? it's 2013 game with 2015 graphics, AI and Tech. Then why should you purchase this? Well surprisingly it's for the ONLINE part of GTA V that's makes it worth the buck. Now I know GTA vets will be pissed off at this comment. But truth is as a beginner in 2023 you'll be smashed with 10 years worth of content. So you'll be overwhelmed with how much this game has to offer. And in my opinion the freedom & abundance of choices is what makes this the Best GTA game ever made.  And yes in my opinion GTA V story > GTA 4 story, because story is aware about and embraces the dual nature of characters and leaves it upto the player to choose their perspective. This is something GTA 4 couldn't do it properly.",True

"This game gave me a lot of emotions, both positive and negative. While I was going through the story line, I was worried about the fate of the characters of the game, which was developing very rapidly in an extraordinary way. The game gives the player a choice of ending the game by either killing one of their friends or saving them. Online of this game is fun, playing with your friends in different fun modes, but there are also story missions. I liked one of them, ""Doomsday"", which is divided into 3 acts, because the events there are rapidly developing, the main characters are betrayed by a crazy AI owner who is trying to destroy the world, but we prevent him from doing it. But in this game there are enough bugs, desynchronizations, some of which are very old and not resolved. Anyway, the game is good!",True

"Truly a masterpiece. Not too many game developers can write such hyper specific stereotypical characters as Rockstar. The gameplay, story, replayabiliity, progression, itemization and fun factor are all 10/10. The only thing that is lacking is the ability to make money to buy all to amazing things in the shops. It's way too grindy and encourages people to purchase the shark cards.",True

"Been trying for a while to enjoy this game, and I can't. I will certainly never recommend anyone actually get this. Even if you were at literal gunpoint and told to buy it, it is not worth it.  - AI 100% aimbots to compensate for terrible (or lack thereof) design. Getting one or two-shot by a meth head who is *barely* wearing pants from 2 blocks away, blind fire, with a pistol, gets really fucking old fast. Getting swarmed by enemies that can see through objects and nail you with impossible precision is a joke. People that defend this are on actual drugs. For the essentially unlimited funding this game had to develop, they barely thought about what was balanced or fun.  - Combat is stupid. Defenders of this trash will say ""it's realistic"" while flying an oppressor jetbike and being unkillable (hacks that Rockstar does nothing about). It leaves little to the imagination to WHY some people get those hacks in the first place. To enjoy the fucking game, even at other's expense, which the game encourages you to do anyway.  - Players are 99% toxic. Good luck finding anyone in public lobbies who isn't a prick. The game rewards bad behavior. Literally. ""Good for you not being a prick. Here's $2000. By the way, grief those players and you'll make twenty times that."" Only met a couple cool people in online, it's a mess.  - Lost interest in the story for single player. NPCs with godlike aim, killing me immediately, and no amount of ""health increases"" or armor matters. The armored Kuruma is the only way to make most things possible, let alone fun. Still, because the devs are stupid, sometimes you will be killed by enemies which have absolutely no way to hit you, armor, building walls, doesn't matter. This system solely exists to waste your time and money. Armor, at best, takes one pistol shot. MAYBE something else but you will never notice. It's immediately gone by some dipshit firing blind a mile away. Fun.  - Everything revolves around shark cards. Every aspect of playing, making money, is designed by an idiot so you get impatient and buy a shark card to skip the gameplay to earn it so you can buy the thing you want.  - If you haven't gotten the picture by now, nothing more I can add will get through to you. Just stay away from it. Or don't, and be miserable.  Do not support this shit heap. It's made a gajillion dollars and me never supporting them ever again will not even register in these asshole's wallets. Do not spend money on this. Ever. There are far cheaper and more entertaining things to do to make you hate life.  Fuck this game.",False

"hey its not like a review but like a beginners guide to make money in gta online  So your main objective is to buy the Kosatka sub for 2.2Mil. And that 2,2mil,youll earn by doing heists.but first youll already have 1mil since i think everyone get the criminal starterpack for free. so heres what you get for free 1.1mil from criminal starter pack 2.500K if you enable 2 factor authentication in your rockstar account  So you still need 700k. If you want to do it by your own then run apartment heists.You can do it by either going to ur house and then starting one or just use the quick join from ur phone.Id suggest you to do the apartment heists since they pay you decent for the time of the mission.  Or if you want to do it the quick way then... make a reddit account and go to r/heistteams  then ask ppl to run heist for you,there are some really generous ppl there so you may get lucky there.also there are many other ways by doing the pistol quest,completing the flight school,weekly time trail etc  but this is the pc version.this game is filled with filthy motherfucking hackers which are desperate to ruin your day.so either play in a public lobby in passive mode or just play in a private session  and sorry for bad english",True

"I've played this game for 550 hours, 543 of those are online. Up until about 3-4 months ago this game was great for the GTA Online portion.  GTA Online has become so infested with modders/hackers that 3 out of 4 sessions you join have you getting hunted down by some idiot in godmode getting killed repeatedly until you have to leave your session, only to join that session and have you and everybody else in the lobby get blown up from a guy 50 miles away using a mod menu. You then leave THAT session, and get teleported to the other end of the map just to get killed repeatedly by another idiot in godmode, then the next session somebody using a mod menu disconnects you and everybody else from the lobby with the push of a button, then you have some guy cashdrop you a huge amount of modded money without asking/against your will and get YOUR account flagged as a potential hacker even though you're one of the legitimate players. Get the picture?  Honestly, if Rockstar did something about the hackers and modders this review will turn to an enthusiastic yes, but as of the last 3 months I haven't been able to do anything at all due to the sheer amount of modders. I'm talking spending 30-40 minutes out of every hour played session hopping to find one without a greifing modder.  Rockstar, fix your platform, this is absolutely ridiculous.",False

"[b]It's a shame that Rockstar can't read the anti-gaming law with understanding. This law prohibits playing with real money or virtual money that can be exchanged back for real money. Neither of these is the case in GTA V, so it is incomprehensible that games such as roulette etc. are blocked in Poland. There is no law applies even though we can buy GTA$ with the Shark card because the Shark card is a good and/or service. By playing we can lose the virtual cash we get as part of this service. As long as Rockstar does not allow the exchange of tokens or GTA$ into currency (Zlotys, Dollars, Euros, etc.) there is no question of violating the Anti-Gambling Act because there is no physical gain and therefore nothing to charge tax on. The purpose of the law is to seal the collection of tax, because before the law there were a lot of points where the profit had the person who placed the Slots did not pay tax on it, as well as the player did not pay tax.[/b]",True

"before you read my review, this is my alt because I play story mode, my actual account as over 1400+ HRS on it,  A Bumpy Ride  Rating: ★★☆☆☆  So, I just have to vent about my time with GTA 5,  especially the online part. Strap in, folks, because this isn't going to be a joyride.  I don't know from where to start but... here we go,  First of all the online mayhem:  GTA 5 online? More like GTA Cheater's Paradise. The place is swarming with players using mod menus, making it feel like a lawless wasteland. Rockstar's effort to clean this mess? Well, it's non-existent. Plus, the in-game prices are so absurdly high a car that you can buy for 100K is worth of 4M  Recent updates? Yeah, they've made the game feel like a wild circus, not in a good way.  Server are too slow, buggy, and laggy The servers are terrible and buggy Trying to enjoy a heist mission? Prepare for a chaotic mess of crashes and glitches. It's almost like they want you to give up,,,  and don't get me started with the customer support, its a nightmare in Itself  My online account had a problem that basically kept me from playing. When I finally reached out to their support, it felt like shouting into the void. Response times were painfully long, and when they did reply, their help was about as useful as a chocolate teapot. ""did you try to delete and reinstall the game?"" To top it all off, they had the audacity to mark my ticket as ""resolved"" when, in reality, it was anything but resolved. Talk about frustrating.  so far the only thing I liked is the story mode, The only saving grace in this GTA 5 ordeal is the story mode. It's a genuine masterpiece, with no cheaters in sight to ruin the fun. If you're thinking about diving into this game, I'd strongly advise sticking to the story mode and steering clear of the online chaos. GTA 5's story mode is a gem, but the online mode is a wild mess of cheaters, wallet-draining prices, and a customer support team that needs a serious upgrade.   Rockstar, if you're listening, it's high time to fix these issues and give us the game we all deserve, Disgusting company that doesn't respect it's customers.  ★★☆☆☆ 2/5  BAD EXPERIENCE.",False

"T.P.I for life! After years of wanting to play this game, I finally robbed my country's central bank to purchase it. Now that our economy has tanked, I can say it was worth it. I'm not sure about the online mode, it was too overwhelming for me and I had RDR2 lined up which just seemed to be way more fun than this so I can't speak about it. The single-player mode was amazing though, coming from GTAIV there is a lot to love save for the unnecessarily violent cops.",True

"I've been playing GTAV on and off since it was first released, and I've been playing a lot more recently (since they opened up most of the missions to play in a private session). I basically stopped playing for a few years because it was impossible (for me, anyway) to find a session where other players would more-or-less leave me alone to do what I wanted to do. Since they will now let me play most missions in a private session, it's been great. If I could find a few friends to play with - a bit difficult for me as I'm an old guy who plays mostly in the afternoons in the eastern United States - I'd be interested in doing the Heists. Oh well, maybe one day.   The ""Story"" is much different from the ""Online"" play, and both are fun. I did finish the Story (I didn't get every last achievement, but that's okay), and now I play almost exclusively online. Note that this game deserves it ""Mature"" rating, mostly for the language, but also for some of the innuendo and some artifacts.   The game mechanics are great! I'd say they're among the best I've seen in any game. It would be nice to see RockStar use the same mechanics in a different story in a different setting. Hint, hint.  If you enjoy FPS games with varied missions and mission types, open world play, and great game mechanics - and you don't mind the language (particularly in the ""Story"" version) - I highly recommend this game.",True

"Fantastic open world game but on line is absolute trash. In my first 2 hours of on line playing I was in the tutorial and I had selected ""Passive Play"" because I only got on line to play some of the fantastic race tracks people have made. I was killed 3 times within 5 minutes by someone who magically drove through a cement wall into a clothing store while they had a God mode and began blowing everything up around us with an rpg and I saw his body go flying and immediately re-appear where he originally shot from then he pointed it right at me and killed me then teleported to me when I respawned and did it again.

"Stepping into GTA 5's gameplay world is like being thrust into a wild and chaotic adventure. The freedom to explore a meticulously designed open-world city is exhilarating. Whether I'm cruising in a stolen car, engaging in heart-pounding shootouts, or participating in meticulously planned heists, every moment feels immersive. The seamless character-switching mechanic adds depth, allowing me to experience the story from different perspectives. And when I'm not following the main plot, there's a plethora of side activities, from skydiving to golf, ensuring I'm never bored. GTA 5's gameplay is a rollercoaster of action, exploration, and unexpected hilarity that keeps me hooked for hours on end.",True

"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is",True
"This game is fun - I like it.  But, a recent update has rendered it unplayable for me:  Before a recent update, Linux and Windows support was flawless.  Now, Grand Theft Auto V is not playable for me on either Linux (Proton) or Windows (native).  On the former, I experienced it occasionally loading and working, other times it doesn't.  It would often get past ""Processing Vulkan Shaders"" and then not launch the Rockstar Games Launcher.  Some other times, it would crash after the loading screen (at about 2-3 stars in the top-right).  On very rare occasions, after restarting Steam, and letting Vulkan shaders process, it would sometimes actually launch.  For the latter, it was fine, until changing my graphics settings, at which point the game loaded and played at less than 1fps, where I was unable to change any settings back at all.  On Linux with Proton (which virtualizes the game!) I was usually around 70-80fps.  Main menu screens being impossible to navigate makes no sense here.  A few hours from initially writing this review, GTA Online is able to pass through all the loading screens, but then immediately crashes when getting ingame.  Fun.  I understand that not all users will experience the aforementioned issues, but it might be something to be wary of, especially if you are looking into running the game through Proton.  Along with those, I still have some other gripes with the game:  The menus also feel clunky and incomplete, and some options are located in hard to find places.  GTA Online lobbies are infested with cheaters all the time - going anywhere but a private or friends only session is simply not a fun experience.  GTA Online's loading times are also extremely long a lot of the time - sometimes taking 2-3 minutes to get into a lobby.  This could be an internet issue, but I'd describe my internet to be pretty average and alright.  This game is still fun once you get things going and I would like to recommend it if I was able to get it working a larger amount of the time - playing GTA Online with my friends is one of my favourite things to do an I enjoy even just being in a lobby and VC with them, with eachother occasionally jumping in and bombing one another and everyone bursting into laughter.  And even playing solo is still a fun experience, at least for me, stealing cars and shooting guns is fun.  PS: If anyone can help me fix my mentioned issues then feel free to reach out.  EDIT: Thought it'd be worth mentioning: Intel i5-12400f AMD RX 6600XT 16GB RAM  EDIT2: I have no idea what I did, but it works now!  I think it's because Windows randomly decided to update and possibly did my graphics drivers.  Could have been an issue with that.  Still very strange.",False

"Single player game = YES! GTA Online = NOOOOOO!   I have way more hours in GTAV than what is shown on my account as I have played since day 1 of it's launch on other platforms. That's part of the problem. I'll leave out the details but the reasons I say to avoid the online part is because it's the most toxic multiplayer game in existence today. It started out good when they stayed within the bounds of the GTA universe but once they introduced game breaking flying bikes/cars/subs/nuclear missile heists/etc it was clear they only cared about the money.   Heists weren't even in the game at first and when they did get put in they weren't terribly unrealistic. But that's when Rockstar(RS) started their turn to greed and predatory shark card pushing. They nerfed payouts for nearly everything while increasing the cost of everything, in an attempt to slow down players getting too much money. Players could buy stuff with all the money RS was paying out in missions/heists and that didn't make people 'need' to buy shark cards. So they just kept adding more stuff at ridiculous prices while also requiring ridiculous storage facilities for these new vehicles and you couldn't even do any new heists unless you owned a certain vehicle/business, thus ultimately making the 'official' grind to get these things a p.i.t.a. Or, just as they expected, people started buying shark cards to compensate for their time which just spiraled out of control into an unrealistic experience that's so out of touch with the original release, RS just said ""oh well it's a different universe that takes place before the events of single player..."" B.S. The reason they haven't made GTA6 sooner is because the cow still had a LOT of milk left.   I don't want the other companies seeing the 'success' of RS as a sign to do the same treatment to their games. Sure you'll make money, but you'll lose a lot of players leading you to end up like RS pandering to whales that keep the game afloat.",True

"Listen up, you crazy bunch! Grand Theft Auto V ain't just a game, it's a full-on crazy ride that'll have your heart pounding like you just downed a jug of adrenaline. I'm talkin' 'bout a world where you can hijack cars, burn rubber like a maniac, and unleash havoc like a bat outta hell. And let me tell you, it's a damn blast!  From the moment you dive into Los Santos, you're smack dab in the middle of a chaotic playground that's fit for folks like me – misfits, lunatics, and downright insane individuals. Michael, Franklin, and that wild card Trevor bring a whole new meaning to the word ""chaos,"" and believe me, things escalate pretty damn quick.  You get behind the wheel of a stolen ride, slam that gas pedal to the floor, and the rush hits you like a shot of adrenaline straight to the veins. And let's talk heists – planning and executing those with a bunch of screwballs by your side? It's like conducting an orchestra of chaos, and I'm the goddamn conductor.  Los Santos, man. This open world is a masterpiece of madness. You got everything from pristine beaches to grimy back alleys, all ready for your brand of mayhem. And the attention to detail? It's like they read my mind. You can be a pilot, go play some damn golf, or raise hell in a strip club. It's a world tailor-made for a guy like me.  The story? Oh, the story is a rollercoaster that'll throw you for loops you never saw coming. Betrayal, lunacy, and plot twists that'll make your head spin. And those random nutjobs you meet along the way? Helping some wacko launch his drugged-up submarine? Yeah, that's just another day in Los Santos.  Graphics? Sounds? Radio stations pumping out twisted tunes? It's like being inside a chaotic fever dream. The only thing missing is the smell of burnt rubber and gunpowder. And damn it, I love every second of it. It's like living out the craziest fantasies without the real-world mess.  So, if you're looking for a taste of the wild side, if you want to dive headfirst into the lunacy and unpredictability, then Grand Theft Auto V is your golden ticket. It's a wild journey that'll have you grinning like a madman, cursing at the screen, and maybe questioning your sanity – all in the best way possible. Embrace the madness, you beautiful maniacs!",True

"The fifth main entry in the GTA series is very much more of the same type of gameplay and story that we're used to, now in a somewhat fresh setting. That said, my main complaint is that there isn't more of it, as completing the main questline left me feeling I still had much to explore, but no incentive to actually do so. I suppose the idea is to play online but as someone with little patience for multiplayer outside my circle of friends, I would have liked more single player content, even if they were autogenerated missions. 60 hours is still a decent playtime though, especially for a game that goes on sale a lot, so pick this up if you haven't already.",True

"well, After 2,744.8 hours of game play, i can officially say that this game is...... complicated.   The actual game itself, single player,  is great.  The online version though.... while the most fun version of GTA, its also \completely over run with modders.  I would say that Rockstar has completely lost control of their online mode.....but i think its by design and they want the modders to play more then actual players.  I have reported HUNDREDS of modders and nothing ever is done about.  at this point I give up.  The online world of GTA is lost to the modders.  After 2,744.89 hours, I struggle to recommend this game.  It has some great moments and fun gameplay, but the online version......... too many modders / hackers............ .just ruins the whole of it.  sad rock star wont do anything about this.  play at your own risk. i recommend single player, or solo lobby for online.",True

Modders are able to do almost anything now, control your character, cage you, constantly kill you, it makes the game unplayable.

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is an extraordinary masterpiece that stands as a testament to the open-world action-adventure genre. With its sprawling, meticulously crafted game world, engaging storyline, and endless opportunities for mayhem, GTA V offers an unparalleled experience that continues to captivate players years after its release.  Set in the fictional city of Los Santos, a stunning reimagining of Los Angeles, GTA V introduces players to a trio of protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking a new life; Franklin, a street-savvy hustler looking to escape his surroundings; and Trevor, a volatile and unpredictable criminal. The character-switching mechanic allows players to seamlessly switch between these three individuals, adding depth to the narrative and offering unique perspectives on the game's unfolding events.  One of the most remarkable aspects of GTA V is its breathtakingly detailed open world. Los Santos is a living, breathing entity teeming with activities, NPCs, and surprises around every corner. From towering skyscrapers to sun-soaked beaches, the city's diverse environments offer a sense of immersion that is truly awe-inspiring. The game's attention to detail, whether in the bustling city streets or the vast countryside, is a testament to Rockstar's dedication to creating a rich and vibrant game world.  The storyline of GTA V is a rollercoaster of heists, betrayals, and unexpected alliances. The interwoven narratives of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor provide an engaging and well-paced experience that keeps players invested in the outcome. The writing is sharp, darkly humorous, and often satirical, tackling social and political issues with a dose of Rockstar's signature irreverence.  Gameplay in GTA V is a harmonious blend of action, driving, and exploration. The sheer variety of activities is staggering – from high-stakes heists and intense shootouts to leisurely sports, races, and even simple pastimes like golf and tennis. The driving mechanics are polished and responsive, and the wide array of vehicles, each with its own distinct handling, adds to the immersive experience.  GTA Online, the game's multiplayer component, extends the life of GTA V even further. It provides a massive open-world playground for players to engage in co-op missions, competitive modes, and open-ended chaos with friends or strangers. The constant updates and additions keep the experience fresh and exciting, offering an ever-evolving online world to explore.  Graphically, GTA V still holds up remarkably well, showcasing intricate details in character models, vehicles, and environments. The game's soundtrack, radio stations, and voice acting are all top-notch, contributing to the overall atmosphere and immersion.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a masterclass in open-world gaming, combining an engaging narrative, a vibrant and diverse game world, and a plethora of activities that cater to every type of player. Its longevity is a testament to its enduring appeal, and even years after its initial release, GTA V remains an essential title that stands as a shining example of Rockstar Games' unparalleled craftsmanship.",True

"Howdy reader, let me state that this review is only for the single player / story mode experience.  To be to the point, this game is good not fantastic, it could have been fantastic if some elements were different, even so - I think you should play it if you haven't already, it's a fun ride.  The main reason why this game is not amazing is because it lacks depth, depth in story, in characters and the world surrounding it; the idea of having three protagonists is quite revolutionary for a triple A game, taking that into consideration, we needed more for every main character, especially for Franklin. Why not use secondary missions to expand on these characters? Their mindsets, their history, their relationships with other individuals, I wanted to understand them better, I perceived the mcs, I just wanted to get more out of these three. I wanted to get a clearer picture of Franklin's hood life, his bond with Lamar, with his ex, with his childhood friends, there was enough structure for that to happen, instead what we got was futile missions who are mostly running jokes or their existence is there only to get a mechanic from the game, which is fine - we can have those but we need the build up missions also, they are essential for a story based game such as this one. I hoped to view additional content of Michael's family life, to spend time with Jimmy, Tracey, Amanda, they're nice kids and I disliked the fact that we went with the full on stereotype characters. Same for Trevor, I craved to watch into his head so to speak - to make proper sense out of him. My point is, this game is too short and it's short for the reason that we have too many meaningless missions that do not shape your protagonists, those quests are forgettable.  You feel like a ragdoll at times due to the fact that the physics are quite strange, the controls for helicopters, airplanes, parachutes and so on are kind of bad on the keyboard, you get used to it though it can be irritating once in a while. GTA's V universe it's detailed, same for the map yet much of the side content it's rather shallow, sure you can do yoga, play tennis, golf and whatever, only most of the players with ignore those activities for half of the game if not for the entire game, keep those inside the game but you also need features to have actual entertainment to follow because it feels natural to follow since you enjoy it. Radio stations required diversity in the music genres, once more, it's good, it could have been superior - perhaps is my taste? I don't know, however, across the majority of the stations, on every channel, I liked what? Usually two songs? I'm only saying they were deficient in quality music, in my opinion and you need quality music since half of the activities will be inside a vehicle. You can say more, though, who wants to read this much?  8 / 10.",True
"A lot of good things in this game. The hours are basically all from singleplayer mods and such, i have almost 900 hours on ps4, and man the online has only gotten worse.

"Title: A Magnificent Urban Playground - Grand Theft Auto V Review  Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) stands as a monumental achievement in the realm of open-world gaming, offering an incredibly detailed and sprawling virtual representation of a vibrant and chaotic metropolis. Rockstar Games' masterpiece, released in 2013, continues to captivate players with its intricate storytelling, diverse characters, and an expansive sandbox environment that pushes the boundaries of what an open-world game can achieve.  From the moment you step into the sun-soaked streets of Los Santos, it becomes apparent that GTA V is an exercise in world-building perfection. The city is alive with an abundance of activities and attractions that cater to a wide range of play styles. Whether you're an adrenaline junkie looking to engage in high-speed police chases, a strategic planner orchestrating elaborate heists, or simply an explorer soaking in the urban sprawl, GTA V offers something for everyone.  The game's narrative is a tour de force, interweaving the stories of three protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor – whose lives and ambitions intersect in unexpected ways. The character development is exceptional, and Rockstar's storytelling prowess is on full display as they delve into the complexities of their personalities, backgrounds, and motivations. Each character is fully realized, making it easy to invest emotionally in their individual journeys.  System Specifications:  RTX 3060 60 Watt of Power 6 GB VRAM  Ryzen 7 5800HX 16 GB DDR4 RAM 512 GB SSD",True

"Back when I got this game, it was fun. Adventures with friends, heists, and missions that you could do alone when friends were offline. Now, it's a buggy mess. Missions can't be completed, it keeps failing to connect to servers, hackers galore, you name it. There's a new game breaking bug every time I play now, and I find myself restarting the game 5 times a night.   Stop milking this game and don't put any more money into Rockstar until they provide something that's actually worth a damn. It's 10 years old Rockstar, move on. GTA Online is a terrible excuse for a gaming product and you can't even keep control of it anyway.",False
"If real life had cheat codes, I'd totally enter ""GTA V"" mode every morning! Who needs a snooze button when you can hijack a helicopter to work, right? This game turns Los Santos into a playground for chaos enthusiasts and traffic law critics. Just remember, in GTA V, jaywalking isn't a crime – it's a way of life. Watching NPCs drive is like witnessing a symphony of car crashes.  Pros: 🌆 Open world? More like open pandemonium! 💰 Robbing virtual banks: 10/10, would felonize again. 🚁 Traffic jams are for quitters; skydiving onto moving cars is where it's at. 🤖 NPCs with the driving skills of a brick on roller skates – unintentional comedy gold. 📺 Invaded by the ""Cops"" TV show? Just pay your virtual therapist with virtual money.  Cons: 🚔 Cops magically teleporting to your location: surprise party or police state? 💥 Accidentally punching the air while trying to enter a car – my character's new interpretive dance move. 🎤 Radio DJs: yes, I'm still here, and yes, I can still hear you.  Verdict: If life gives you lemons, make a ramp and jump a stolen car into the sunset. ""GTA V"" is a masterpiece of mayhem, where obeying traffic laws is merely a suggestion. So, put on your helmet, grab a rocket launcher, and let the anarchy begin!",True

"For me, Grand Theft Auto V’s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane, fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time, whilst driving around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path, and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. “Typical!” one of them yelled at me, as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.  I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments, big and small, that make San Andreas – the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas – feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well-realised world and tells a story that’s gripping, thrilling, and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series, and there’s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn’t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It’s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto-aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road, though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last, Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons, mission checkpointing, ensuring that you never have to do a long, tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again.",True

Also hoping fueling cars and turning signals would be a thing in GTA 6 too.  Also I really loved the setup camp feature from RDR2 and hope something like this would be implemented to GTA 6, be it chairs tents a rug maybe.  The most fun we had in this game is spending time with your friends in a private lobby, Hosting off-road events with our SUV's and Pickup trucks, camping and telling stories near the river around a campfire.

"I have been a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series for years, and Grand Theft Auto V absolutely exceeded my expectations! This game offers an unparalleled open-world experience that keeps you hooked from the very beginning.  The first thing that struck me was the incredibly detailed and immersive world of Los Santos. The city is bustling with life, from the diverse pedestrians going about their business to the stunning landscapes that seamlessly blend urban and natural environments. Every street corner has its own story to tell, making exploration an absolute joy.  The characters in GTA 5 are some of the most memorable and well-developed in gaming history. Michael, Franklin, and Trevor each bring their own unique personalities and backgrounds to the table, creating a perfect dynamic within the storyline. The voice acting and character animations are top-notch, making every interaction feel genuine and engaging.  What truly sets GTA 5 apart is its storytelling. The intertwining narratives of the three protagonists keep you invested in every twist and turn of the plot. The missions are diverse and exciting, ranging from high-octane heists to heartwarming moments that reveal the characters' deeper sides. The writing is sharp, witty, and often satirical, offering both thought-provoking social commentary and laugh-out-loud humor.  The attention to detail in Grand Theft Auto V is astounding. From the realistic physics and driving mechanics to the bustling traffic and pedestrians, the world feels alive in every way. Whether you're engaging in a high-speed chase, participating in a street race, or simply soaking in the beautiful sunset over the ocean, the level of immersion is unparalleled.  And let's not forget about GTA Online! The multiplayer aspect of the game adds a whole new layer of fun and competition. Whether you're teaming up with friends for heists or engaging in wild and creative game modes, there's always something new to explore and experience.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece that has set a new standard for open-world gaming. Rockstar Games has once again delivered an unforgettable experience that combines gripping storytelling, stunning visuals, and boundless opportunities for exploration. If you're looking for a game that will keep you entertained for hours on end, GTA 5 is an absolute must-play!",True

"[h1]First Look[/h1]  [hr] [/hr]  As for me, lets say [I]im not incredibly fond of quite like any shooter game(such as Fortnite, CS GO etc.)[/I] because of them having pretty much only two main goals: Shoot any opponent on sight, and survive yourself which with time become just oblivious. But you would say: if so, then [b][I]Why am I recommending the game then?[/I][/b] Its quite simple, [b]  [I]Because GTA5 is NOTHING like those shooter games![/I][/b] This fact is due to GTA being an [I]Open - World Game[/I], which means that you not necessarily have to run around and shoot anyone aimlessly, but you can also progress in the storyline of the game itself (in Story Mode) or collaborate with  other player in quite any mission (in Online), for example: buy and re-sell cars etc.  [h1][...]TO BE CONTINUED[/h1]",True

Therefore you're just stuck with a copy of gta that you cant play because you no longer have access to the social club account you used it with.

"0 Stars. GTA used to be a really good franchise but R* has proven their incompetence by an absolute lack of attention to fixing bugs or preventing hacks. Most recently none of the in game menus work, so you're unable to complete missions, call for vehicles, or utilize anything that isn't on the in game phone. Loading still takes obscenely forever, even for a 10 year old game. That is when it actually does load between whatever areas it has to load. Too often you end up staring at a garage door trying to walk into a garage area or playing cloud simulator waiting for a load back into the world from a race or mission.  Instead of fixing issues like this which have plagued the game from DAY #1, R* has instead focused on bringing new characters, missions, vehicles, and weapons into the game. It doesn't matter how much content the game has if it's not playable! Even when the game is running properly, online griefers run rampant with glitchers, hackers, and exploiters to prevent even simple enjoyable gameplay. It always deteriorates into a PvP match instead of an open-ended world where people can play together. R* has never bothered to institute server options to prevent PvP outside of a ghost mode which makes it impossible for you to wield weapons thereby impossible to complete missions. Yes, nobody can kill you in this mode, but you can't play the game either. R* has ruined what used to be an amazing immersive series with an endless quest for profit.",False

The online part was the pain in the ass. I mean everything was fine the missions was fun and challenging. But i don't understand how they can't prevent this cheats in the game, it's so annoying. But u know what the saddest part about it? Not the failed missions because of cheaters, not the despair feeling. The saddest part is that this ""humans"" who uses cheats are mentally ill and i think that they need to get help. Because it's really not a normal behavior.  I hope that Grand Theft Auto 6 would be prepared for this cheaters. Good luck Rockstar.",True

"[h1]Single-player[/h1] The single-player is great. The missions are fun and hold up well after all these years.. I think the problem is the story: The protagonists are great, but the antagonists leave a lot to be desired. There isn't a villain like Dmitri Rascalov, Officer Tenpenny, Dutch or Micah. It's a more vague thing, like ""Michael's problems"". So you hop from minor antagonist to minor antagonist until the story ends because Michael's arc is finally completed. I'm not sure it works from a climatic point of view. The gameplay feels evolved from GTA IV, the animations are much smoother, the graphics are better, the world overall feels more sophisticated and more populated, there is simply just more content. This is not without its drawbacks, however: Some things have been scaled down, like the physics simulations in shooting and driving and the damage model to cars. I don't know if it was due to game performance or not, but since this game was made for the PS3, I guess they couldn't fit all the new things without taking some old things out first.  [h1]Online[/h1] The online is very fun... with friends. If you play in a public session, you can count on some griefing, some hacking giving you money so R* bans you, some funny guy crashing your game... but if you play private sessions with friends it's very enjoyable.  I like exploring all the content added to the game over the course of these 10 years. The first heists are a bit dated now, but the Casino Heist, Doomsday and Cayo Perico are great. It shows R* learned what works and what doesn't. But you don't need these things to have fun. I enjoy doing things like Top Gear-type challenges in places where you don't really go in the story, so you have a lot to explore before you feel like you need to buy expansion content.  [h1]Microtransactions[/h1] GTA Online has these microtransactions called shark cards. People complain the expansions are very grindy because they feel R* wants you to buy them. I agree. It feels like they made them with the following options in mind: - A: Buy a shark card so you purchase the property/car/etc and its upgrades -> the expansion is fun and yields good in-game money, so you can buy more things and have more fun. - B: Grind to purchase the thing, then grind some more so you can purchase the upgrades which make the property profitable: not as fun.  Same thing with cars and houses. In Midnight Club LA, R* sold car packs for $2.99, now they sell cars for a million GTA$. This gives you the option to pay with your time instead of only your wallet.  Nobody tells you about this, it's very subconscious. If R* went with option A and sold the expansions/DLC on the side, people wouldn't complain, but they probably wouldn't care either or call the game P2W, so I feel like it worked out okay.",True

"This game is one of the worst games you can buy. It seems fun and at times can be, but the amount of bs anyone has to get through to get to the fun parts is insanely too much. If you are lucky enough to load in before 30 mins of failed attempts (not my network), you will then get to try calling the mechanic to bring you one of the cool cars you bought, and that vital menu freezes 50% of the time. So players must get to their garages to use their cars and go do missions and PLAY THE GAME, and 60% of the time you load into a building or garage, your game gets stuck in a loading loop. If you are lucky, you can press alt f4 or tab out a few times and then load in, or just restart your game and the porcess entirely. And if you somehow are driving around in your sick car doing a mission or just cruising, you have 30 seconds before a hacker or a mk2 oppressor kid explodes you and then continues to explode you until you leave the session or go passive mode, which then you cant use any of the parts of the game that are fun. Or it will be a hacker on an oppressor. I have had a lot of fun on this game, but it has caused so much frustration and wasted so much of my time just on loading screens. SAVE YOUR MONEY buy a simpler game or one not made by rockstar or get a better hobby than video games.",False

"I do not recommend this if you play for online mode I've been a gta player for over 12 years on console who now moved to pc and I'll say one thing for sure THIS GAME SUCKS the anti-cheat is terrible and the only reason people cheat on this game is to be a prick or to get money because rockstar refuses to make their game playable to a degree that is good for casual players this game has been and always will be terrible and a shit place to spend your time here's a few problems I have with it  1. Its impossible to be in a public lobby: there is almost no conceivable way to be in a public lobby without some jackass using or advertising their shitty mod menu a example is a guy named Ineludible who is always advertising their scam malware mod menu and crashing and or killing you every time you call him out for trying to scam people or steal their info  2. Rockstar wants you to buy shark cards: I have believed that rockstar has pushed their shitty version of a pay to win system forever they purposely make jobs underpay and heists too hard to grind because they need you to buy their micro transactions and I fully believe gta 6 will be exactly the same because go figure rockstar does not give a rats ass about keeping this game nice and playable they just want to milk it dry and I know that for a fact because as someone who played on console for ages I got excited over little things like a tire falling off your car if it got hit to hard but rockstar won't ever start caring because gta is just a cash grab to them  3. the players: the playerbase is some of the most toxic and hard to put up with people ever between the griefing, modding and just exploiting they're horrible and they almost always use some lame ass excuse ""you're meant to kill other players"" or ""it's in the game for a reason"" it doesn't excuse the players to be as shit as they are you get little to nothing from ruining someones hard work yet they still do because they are terrible people and rockstar refuses to ban these people because they're just more money holes to be used not to mention the fact that rockstar denies making lobbies where you can play most things solo because ""you need more people"" from the bottom of my heart I hate this game and I'm sure rockstar does too",False

"everyone knows everything said about this game, story good, online bad, but holy shit is online sometimes impossible. sure grinding is inevitable but sometimes its genuinely hard to fathom how much you have to grind, not to mention its been the buggiest piece of hardened dried shit on the side of your ass crack. crashing,  hackers, servers getting fucked, uncomfortable controls at best and an overall shitty experience especially playing alone makes online dogshit. rockstar also really does not care about fixing the game because some fucking selfish shitheads just love to keep buying shit like shark cards, letting rockstar chill with their actual billions pouring in every year all the while theyre removing good content because they know theyll just get more money anyways. story fire though.",False

My recommendation is this game is worth it just to play online. It is great, amazing, full of action and adventure, that this game can really be for anyone, well anyone at least 17 years and older, but we all know there are kids who will get it anyway. I will end with this. This game has taken a huge chunk of my life or at least a few days worth of it anyway, and I will say it were some of the calmest days I have ever had. Probably helps its a game I was watching my babysitter play when I was like 11 or so so I have been interested in the game for a long long time.",True

Walking around the city or driving through the streets, you can't help but appreciate the small stuff like how the light hits surfaces or the expressions on people's faces. Especially online mode. GTA V's online mode is the icing on top. If you're into action packed gameplay, you're in for a treat.

"Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5)  Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece that has captivated gamers around the world with its unparalleled blend of gripping storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and a dynamic open-world environment that offers endless possibilities. As a dedicated player and enthusiast, I can confidently say that GTA V stands as a shining testament to the incredible achievements of the gaming industry.

The attention to detail is nothing short of astonishing, from the bustling streets teeming with pedestrians to the meticulously designed interiors of various buildings. Each nook and cranny of the city exudes authenticity and realism, making it a joy to explore and experience.  One of the standout features of GTA V is its engrossing storyline. Rockstar Games has outdone themselves by weaving together the lives of three distinct protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor - in a narrative that is both compelling and emotionally charged. The characters are multifaceted, each bringing their own unique perspectives and motivations to the table. Watching their stories unfold and intertwine is an experience that leaves a lasting impact, making you genuinely care about their fates.  Beyond the main storyline, GTA V offers an astounding array of activities to keep players engaged for countless hours. Whether you're indulging in high-stakes heists that require meticulous planning, partaking in adrenaline-pumping races across land, sea, and air, or simply enjoying the laid-back pastimes like tennis, golf, and yoga, there's something for every kind of player.  The online component, Grand Theft Auto Online, elevates the game even further, providing an expansive multiplayer playground that invites you to team up with friends or compete against others in a wide range of activities. The continuous updates and content additions from Rockstar ensure that the experience remains fresh and exciting, keeping players coming back for more.  Visually, GTA V is a masterpiece. The level of detail in the graphics, especially on modern hardware, is simply breathtaking.

Its unparalleled attention to detail, engrossing narrative, and wealth of content make it a must-play title for gamers of all kinds. Rockstar Games has delivered a true masterpiece that has set a new standard for open-world gaming, and it's an experience that no gamer should miss.",True

"[h1]Grand Theft Auto V - A Dizzying Descent into Gratuitous Violence and Societal Decay[/h1]  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) stands as a prime example of a game that prioritizes shock value and gratuitous violence over meaningful storytelling and responsible gameplay. While the series has garnered a massive following for its open-world environments and sandbox gameplay, GTA V takes the worst aspects of its predecessors and amplifies them to an alarming degree, creating a virtual playground that revels in immoral behavior and contributes to a troubling cultural landscape.  From the outset, GTA V showcases a narrative that glorifies criminality and glamorizes antisocial behavior. The protagonists are a trio of morally bankrupt individuals, each embroiled in a web of crime, violence, and corruption. While the concept of playing as antiheroes is not inherently problematic, GTA V crosses a line by portraying their actions as humorous and entertaining, rather than exploring the consequences of their choices. This lack of nuance and depth undermines any potential for meaningful character development, reducing the story to a series of shockingly violent and exploitative set pieces.  One of the most concerning aspects of GTA V is its unrelenting focus on violence and degradation. The game offers players a staggering array of weapons to wreak havoc upon the game world, from firearms and explosives to melee weapons. This arsenal is used not just against rival gangs or law enforcement, but also against innocent pedestrians and bystanders who are treated as little more than collateral damage. The game's missions often involve acts of brutality, from torture sequences to heinous acts of cruelty, further reinforcing the idea that violence is not only acceptable but also integral to progressing in the game.  Furthermore, GTA V's open-world environment encourages players to engage in rampant destruction and chaos without any meaningful consequences. The game's mechanics actively reward players for causing mayhem, such as earning money from committing crimes and evading the police. This encourages a toxic cycle of behavior that normalizes criminality and recklessness, undermining any semblance of ethical gameplay.  The game's treatment of women is particularly troubling, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and objectification. Female characters are often reduced to one-dimensional roles, existing solely for the purpose of providing sexual gratification or as mere plot devices. The pervasive misogyny extends to the game's humor, which frequently relies on offensive and degrading jokes that reinforce harmful attitudes toward women.  Beyond its narrative and thematic concerns, GTA V also suffers from technical issues and a lack of innovation. The game's character models and animations appear outdated and stiff, failing to match the level of graphical fidelity expected from a modern title. The open-world environment, while expansive, often feels lifeless and devoid of meaningful interactions, leading to a sense of emptiness and repetitiveness. The online component, Grand Theft Auto Online, is plagued with microtransactions and a persistent grind that favors players willing to spend real money to progress, further contributing to a sense of exploitation and unfairness.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V exemplifies a disturbing trend in the gaming industry where shock value and gratuitous violence take precedence over responsible storytelling and thoughtful gameplay. The game's glorification of criminal behavior, exploitation of vulnerable themes, and overall lack of accountability contribute to a toxic gaming culture that normalizes antisocial actions and undermines the potential for meaningful experiences. Rather than pushing boundaries in a positive direction, GTA V succumbs to the worst impulses of its creators, resulting in a game that is more harmful than entertaining. As a reflection of societal values and cultural impact, GTA V stands as a stark reminder of the need for responsible and thoughtful game design that prioritizes the well-being of players and the broader gaming community.",True

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) stands as an unparalleled masterpiece in the world of gaming, delivering an immersive experience that has set new standards for open-world gameplay. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this installment, showcasing their expertise in storytelling, game mechanics, and world-building. As a devoted player, I can confidently award GTA 5 a well-deserved 5-star rating.  The first aspect that strikes players is the meticulously crafted world of Los Santos and Blaine County. The level of detail is astonishing, with every nook and cranny teeming with life, from bustling city streets to serene countryside landscapes. The sheer scope of the map, coupled with the seamless transition between urban and rural environments, creates a living, breathing world that feels genuine and alive.  The game's narrative is another standout feature. The interwoven stories of three distinct protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor - bring a refreshing dynamic to the traditional GTA formula. Each character has their own unique background, motivations, and quirks, adding layers of complexity to the storyline. Rockstar's signature satire and social commentary are well-presented, making the narrative both engaging and thought-provoking.  Gameplay mechanics in GTA 5 are nothing short of exceptional. The driving mechanics strike a perfect balance between realism and fun, ensuring that vehicular mayhem remains as entertaining as ever. Shooting mechanics are smooth and responsive, enhancing the action-packed sequences that the series is renowned for. The addition of heists adds an extra layer of strategy and excitement, enabling players to meticulously plan and execute high-stakes robberies with their chosen crew.  What truly sets GTA 5 apart is the online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online. It's a sprawling universe in its own right, offering players the chance to explore Los Santos with their friends, engage in various activities, and even create their own content. The consistent updates and additions by Rockstar have kept the online community vibrant and ever-evolving.  Graphically, GTA 5 continues to amaze even years after its initial release. The attention to detail, realistic lighting, and meticulous character animations create an immersive experience that stands the test of time. The level of optimization on various platforms is commendable, ensuring that players across different systems can enjoy the game without compromising on visual quality.

"When I was growing up I couldn't really play these kinds of video games in my mother's household. I never bothered to play this game at a friend's house either. I just never got around to it. That was until I turned 20 years old and moved out of my parents' house and into my own apartment. I found this game on sale and I figured why not get it. After 80 hours into this game (barely touched the multiplayer mind you) I'm in love with the single player campaign. I'm glad I never played this game until I turned 20 because not only am I free from having to look over my shoulder when I'm at the strip club, but I understand jokes and references 14 year old me would've never understood. The campaign is hilarious and really fun to play and I know i'm 10 years behind on all of this but I waited long enough to finally play this game that my parents banned with extreme predjudice.",True

"Oh, Grand Theft Auto V, you wild, sussy, and absolutely ridiculous masterpiece. Buckle up, babes, 'cause we're about to dive into the zaniest world this side of Ohio! Lemme tell ya, when I first loaded up this game, I was like ""nahhhhh, they didn't just go there!"" But they did, and I forgor all my worries 'cause I was bout to come on this epic adventure, gang gang!  The moment I stepped into Los Santos, I felt like an amogus in a world full of swaggy chaos. I mean, seriously, where else can you casually jack a car, chase a train, and rob a convenience store in one go? It's like a real-life favorite meme compilation, except you're in control of the madness. Yummers!  But let's talk about them characters, fam. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin – what a trio! Michael's like that older femboy in the hood, tryna keep it lowkey but ending up in the wildest heists. Trevor? Oh my days, that man is pure chaotic energy. Every time he's on screen, it's an ""ermm yoinks!"" moment, and you just can't help but love the crazy mofo.  And speaking of NPCs, oh boy, they're a whole mood. You'll find 'em bing chilling on the streets, saying some of the most random stuff. It's like they're all part of a secret Ohio club or something. You'll be walking along, and some dude just hits you with a ""scrumptious!"" line outta nowhere. Only in GTA V, I tell ya.  The city itself, Los Santos, is a work of art, so vibrant and full of life. From the posh neighborhoods to the gritty back alleys, it's a melting pot of weird and wonderful. You can even switch between characters, which is like being in multiple places at once, being your own femboy army – zesty times indeed!  But let's be real, sometimes the game's humor can be a bit ""NPC"" level, like they're trying too hard to be funny. And those loading screens, ugh, they're longer than a cross-country road trip from Ohio to California. But hey, nothing's perfect, right?  In the end, Grand Theft Auto V is a sussy rollercoaster of chaos and adventure, a game that leaves you laughing, scratching your head, and yelling ""when the impostor is sus!"" all in one sitting. It's a classic that's imprinted its mark on gaming culture, and you can't deny its impact. So, if you haven't played it yet, what are you waiting for? Hop in, fam, and let's go on a wild, goofy ahh ride through the crazy streets of Los Santos!",True

"GTA Online was the best and worst thing to happen to rockstar Made them lazy and complacent since they can just print money cause of the mindless kids who enjoy wasting money on that sort of thing  But not all is Negative and most of my salt comes from the fact we will probably never see a DLC to the story of any rockstar game cause theres no way for them to monetize it  The story in this is phenomenal such an incredible performance from all the voice actors and talent  One of the prettier games ever made as well I wish there was a ""mixed"" review button cause most of my hate and infuriation with the game really comes from love,but i have never been a fan of how GTA Online works at all and that will probably never change,unlike rockstar lmao",False
"In comparison to it's predecessor, GTA IV, it has significant downgrades in it's physics engine and driving mechanics. The story mode doesn't get anywhere near as dark but it introduces many new fun mechanics. If you're strictly interested in the single player experience, I would honestly recommend GTA IV first. That being said, for people more interested in multiplayer, GTA V's online experience suffers from many issues, steer away from public lobbies. The game has fallen off and all of their content released after 2017 has only contributed to it's downfall.  The only reason I can recommend this game is because despite it's shortcomings and terrible updates, it still has a lot to offer and is typically on sale for $15 or less. Just buy it, it's been nearly 10 years.",True

"They have ruined the game 2 years after release gta ONLINE atleast. They made it pay to play and to grind is IMPOSSIBLE. To put it into perspective most ""decent"" cars are $1m or more, a normal mission takes about 15 minutes to complete and you get 15k TOPS.  The average guy cannot play this game and enjoy it you would have to make it your life over 40 hrs a week.  Also they ban people for no reason, and if there is a good reason they will not share it with you or talk to you about it, so hope you dont sell 2 many cars or get a griefer modder to drop u cash or something without your intent,  cuz your account will be gone.  Happened to me 2 times after years of playing.  Single player is the best but the bad side is, they havnt done ANYTHING to it since the release so u got a day of enjoyment there and its over.",False

"Grand Theft Auto V is a sandbox game that takes place in the streets in the fictional crime city of Los Santos (based upon los angeles). Within the game, you can complete missions, heists, own businesses, and one of my favorites: commit mass genocide upon innocent civilians. All jokes aside, GTA is one of my favorite games, just because of the wide variety of content that it offers. You can really do almost anything crime-related that you see in movies, ranging from escaping the cops in a high-speed police pursuit, to robbing the richest man on earth.        The game has two entirely separate parts. There's the story mode, and the online mode. For a person who enjoys a compelling adventure, story mode has one of the best experiences gaming has to offer, with you being able to play the role as a criminal millionaire father of two millennial kids (Michael), a physco named Trevor, or a nice but rough gangster who goes by Franklin.        The online version on the other hand, puts you in a server with around 30 other people, offering a different experience entirely. While you can still do things like rob stores, do heists, and run businesses, the goal of the online version is to simply aquire as much money as possible, and grief other players with the most overpowered vehicles and weapons the game has to offer. This version requires A LOT more time and dedication than the story mode to really do anything, and the grinding that is needed to earn any substantial amount of money is gruesome and tedius. If you don't have irl money to just buy your way up the ranks, or enough time for the insane amount of grinding, I would just focus on the story mode.   Overall, Both aspects of the game are cool, but I'd say the story mode is where the real fun is at. The game doesn't cost much money, and tbh it gives you a pretty good bang for your buck, so I personally would recommend getting it. Anywho that was my opinion. hope ya'll have a good one. peace",True

"My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is.⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠿⠿⠿⠿⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠟⠋⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢺⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠆⠜⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⠿⠿⠛⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠉⠻⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⡏⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⣀⣠⣤⣤⣶⣶⣶⣶⣶⣦⣤⡄⠀⠀⠀⠀⢀⣴⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣷⣄⠀⠀⠀⢠⣾⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⢿⡧⠇⢀⣤⣶⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣾⣮⣭⣿⡻⣽⣒⠀⣤⣜⣭⠐⢐⣒⠢⢰⢸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣏⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡟⣾⣿⠂⢈⢿⣷⣞⣸⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣽⣿⣿⣷⣶⣾⡿⠿⣿⠗⠈⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠻⠋⠉⠑⠀⠀⢘⢻⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⢹⣿⣿⡇⢀⣶⣶⠴⠶⠀⠀⢽⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⡿⠀⠀⢸⣿⣿⠀⠀⠣⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡟⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⣿⣿⣿⡿⠟⠋⠀⠀⠀⠀⠹⣿⣧⣀⠀⠀⠀⠀⡀⣴⠁⢘⡙⢿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⠉⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠙⢿⠗⠂⠄⠀⣴⡟⠀⠀⡃⠀⠉⠉⠟⡿⣿⣿⣿⣿ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⢷⠾⠛⠂⢹⠀⠀⠀⢡⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠙⠛⠿⢿",True

"FINALLY  I've completed this title a second time now since I completed it in the Xbox 360.  There's not much to say really. Everybody knows GTA V. It's a classic now, I would say. Great story, great mechanics and great soundtrack. A campaign that I've replayed a thousand times already because of how good it is.  On the other hand, I really like GTA Online, but I feel Rockstar has not been the same since all the attention went down only to this section. I would've wanted a more balanced way of dealing with the other games in the company, like releasing a good remaster of the GTA trilogy, to add content to RDO or to simply make new games like they used to. I'm sad about the way the company is right now, and one can only hope they were what they used to be years ago.",True

宗教と政治はしばしば一部の人々にすべての視点を失い、感情的な子供のように怒鳴り、絶賛し、続けることに道を譲ります。彼らは理性を持ってそれを議論することを拒否するか、そうでなければ彼らは議論を行うための地獄の方法である議論の人身攻撃を好むかのどちらかです。まあ、とにかく、少し前に私は選挙と、キャンペーンがどのように問題を無視し、代わりに攻撃的で個人的ながらくたに固執しているかについて話していましたそれは政府を運営することの実質的な問題とは何の関係もありませんでした(あなたが候補者のスピーチといわゆる討論に従ったならばあなたが知っているように、それはすべて真実です)。とにかく、私が話していた男の一人は、彼が突然笑って、私たち全員がshtでいっぱいだと言ったときを除いて、会話全体で一言も言わなかった、そしてそれが私たち全員がアメリカ合衆国を憎む方法だったのなら、なぜ私たち全員がロシアや中国に住まなかったのか!次にあなたが知っていることは、咲く議論全体が乱闘のようであり、形容詞は厚くそして速く飛んで、騒音は信じられないほどでした!誰かが「雌犬の息子」と言った、そして私は彼が「ろくでなし!」と言ったと思う。(私は確信が持てませんでした;それはすべてとても混乱していました。まあ、とにかく、私はそれをすべて合理的なレベルに戻そうとしていました。たとえば、私はそれをすべて始めた人と話をしようとしました、そして私は彼に私たちが皆たわごとでいっぱいであるとはどういう意味ですか?彼はそれを知っていたように事実の陳述をしていましたか、そして彼の主張を裏付ける彼の文書はどこにありましたか?ソクラテスは私が彼の議論に反論した方法を誇りに思っていただろうと思います。つまり、私はそれに反論しようとしました。しかし、彼が反論として提供できたのは、私たち全員がたわごとでいっぱいだったことについて、もっと同じでした。しかし、彼は理由を言いませんでした。彼はただそれを繰り返し続けました。それとロシアと中国と共産主義のカモについての部分。そして、私は少し腹を立てて、彼のアイデアを彼のお尻に詰め込むように彼に言ったことを告白しなければなりません(あなたが私に言う必要はありませんが、議論で誰かを説得する方法はほとんどありません)。それから彼は塩辛くなり、私が黙らなければ私に口にパンチを与えると脅しました。そして、私は本当に熱くなり、他の人も熱くなりました。そして、私たちは皆、保守党氏のshtを打ち負かしました。そして、結局のところ、彼は非難されるのは自分自身だけでした。これはまだ自由な国であり、私のような仲間に「兄弟、あなたはsh * tでいっぱいです」と言う人は誰でも、理由を言うかどうか尋ねられたときに丁寧に答える準備ができています!,True

"Alright, let's get one thing straight – the story in GTA V? Yeah, it's like it was given to a 16 years old pi*mp to write it, it's a hot mess that even a Brain death wouldn't write. But hold up, before you go running for the hills, this game still shines brighter than a supernova.  I mean, come on, we're talking about a game made by Rockstar. It's like Rockstar read the book of mayhem, tore it up, and rewrote it with a rocket launcher in hand. And hey, let's not forget that the online chaos is like a never-ending party in the underworld.  Sure, the story might be a dumpster fire, but let's not kid ourselves – this game is like an old buddy from way back when. Nostalgia hits you harder than a freight train, and you can't help but remember the good times you've had with this bad boy. I've practically lived, breathed, and thrown controllers at the screen because of this game. It's the kind of nostalgia trip that makes you wanna hug your console and thank it for all the hours of pure insanity.  So, let's cut the crap and give credit where it's due. GTA V might have a story that's more messed up than a pi*mp on caffeine, but damn, it's the kind of mess we can't help but love. It's like that crazy ex you can't forget – infuriating and irresistible at the same damn time. So grab your weapons, rev up those engines, and dive headfirst into the chaos, because this game is a wild ride you won't want to miss.",True

"GTAV story mode has dozens of hours worth of content to offer, and i have to point out that i don't personally know anyone who attained a 100% completion yet. That's just about where the fun ends; GTA Online is completely broken, and instead of fixing known issues, Rockstar games keeps adding new content that breaks the game even more.  all the new content that Rockstar Games adds is boring, there's nothing interesting. all the latest missions basically force you to use heavy weapons like minigun, RPG, etc. which gets boring very quickly. It's straight up impossible to finish them with a simple assault rifle, whether it's caused by a dozen enemies spawning at your own spawn point, or the fact that the NPCs have an absurd accuracy and can give you a headshot even when they don't see you through the bushes.  Old content has few missions that keep repeating over and over and become repetitive very quickly - at this point I am doing them just for the money, and even then i often don't want to launch them.  Public online sessions are unplayable, you have about an 80% chance of joining a lobby with a cheater who will teleport you all across the map against your will, lock you in a cage, explode you, or even give you modded money which can easily result in you getting banned and having your entire progress reset. Rockstar games has supposedly done some changes recently, but I have not noticed any difference, same goes for my friends.  I couldn't forget to mention how Rockstar games has recently removed almost 200 old vehicles with no rational explanation. They are now incredibly difficult or impossible to obtain, even though many of them were very popular in the playerbase. The reasoning Rockstar games has given us is that ""they wanted to remove vehicles that weren't being purchased very often, to reduce how much we would have to scroll on the websites.""  GTA Online also used to have many different competitive jobs, especially adversary modes. I remember browsing through a list of hundreds of different adversary modes the game had to offer. Recently I have come to the horrible discovery that Rockstar games has yet again deleted the old content and that the list now contains barely 60 adversary modes, and exactly none of the ones i used to play. I haven't found any announcement about this anywhere, only people complaining about it and being equally as confused as me  TL;DR: this game is absolutely not worth buying in 2023 and onward, and that's coming from someone who's been playing since 2016. If you do want to get it, do yourself a favor and wait for a sale",False

"Honestly at this point i would not recommend GTA V it has been 10 Years and it just has a lot of issues. Leveling up in the LS Car meet takes an insane amount of time their is no fast way to do it, unless you wanna leave you PC on idle for hours to unlock car meet exclusive liveries. The Dre contract while it can earn you a good amount of money the 40 minute cool down or so really kinda kills it. This game has really become more of a cool down simulator where you always have a timer before you can make big money. Which is of course intentional because shark cards exist and they want you to buy those. Grinding is very tedious in this game. so many vehicles and customization's are locked behind other items you have to purchase which could be really annoying. The heists are a good way to make money, but if you have no one to play with it can be difficult to do alone and at times just are not worth it. Now GTA V can be fun to play online with friends and the story is not terrible by any means. But all the stupid tactics they use to make everything as annoying as possible in hopes that you will buy their shark cards is well unbearable at times. I have put many hours into this, most of it is from idle leveling in the ls car meet. Not really worth it though. You also can not have more than one vehicle out at a time which is frustrating. It should allow you to have at  least your car and jet out at the same time. You also can not fast travel to your own,owned properties. The cut scenes for missions and heists are not skippable because of how they were developed also you can not turn off dialogue alone because it is mixed with the SFX and listening to Lester and Franklin, Dre etc gets really old really fast.",False

"""Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) is an exhilarating open-world action-adventure game that captivates players with its sprawling virtual world and immersive gameplay. Set in the fictional city of Los Santos, the game offers a richly detailed environment where players can freely explore, engage in various activities, and embark on a gripping criminal narrative.  The game boasts stunning graphics and attention to detail that bring the city to life, from bustling urban streets to serene countryside landscapes. The variety of characters, each with their own stories, adds depth to the narrative, making for a compelling single-player experience.  GTA 5's gameplay is a seamless blend of story missions, heists, and a myriad of side activities. Whether driving high-speed vehicles, participating in thrilling shootouts, or just enjoying leisurely pastimes like tennis or golf, there's never a dull moment. The diverse range of vehicles, weapons, and customization options ensures that players can tailor their experience to suit their preferences.  One highlight of GTA 5 is the innovative ""GTA Online"" mode, offering a dynamic multiplayer environment. Friends can team up to tackle missions, races, and challenges, or engage in more chaotic activities like open-world mayhem and heists. The constant updates and new content injected into the online world keep the experience fresh and exciting.  While GTA 5's storyline and gameplay are undeniably engaging, it's important to note that the game's mature themes, including violence, crime, and adult content, may not be suitable for all audiences. Despite this, GTA 5 remains a standout title in the gaming world, offering a blend of action, exploration, and storytelling that continues to captivate players.""",True

If you wan't to play this online. DONT Rockstar doesn't give a shit about the cheaters that make the majority of its playerbase.  They don't care about the former because of the latter.

Servers connectivety is a bit spotty but playable.  Its the cheaters that are the majority of the players ruin this game online. Totally unplayable.

General Complaints: Characters run slow like molasses compared to protagonist of GTA SA. Turning is sluggish (sacrificing satisfying locomotion in favor of smooth transition between animations or ""realism"").  Dying is easier and armor wears off quicker.

"I do not play this game correctly and I like it that way.  Never done a single heist or quest or whatever they are, and I don't play single player either, I just fuck around on multiplayer and it's a great time.  Would highly recommend starting a life only to have it tragically ripped away from you. You could also have an emo photo shoot if you want to do that.

"Online mode is so good and interesting in gta 5 , we can buy some really cool garage and store super cars and also special vehicles. I would recommend you to play this game on atleast a 4gb graphics card device with i5 for smooth performance. Based on my experience online mode is better than story mode , especially if you have friends who play Gta online. I personally love using military outfits and supercars , tanks and other miltary and futuristic vehicles in online mode. I think this game will help you gain experience which will later help you when GTA 6 is released  (This game shouldn't be played in presence of parents because of some inappropriate scenes and language)",True

"I used to love this game, now however it is unplayable online. In every session you will find hackers who have modded their game in some way, which disrupts the whole server and can cause grief to any player playing on it. Other hackers don't even bother modding their game, but instead can tell you your own IP address - best to use a VPN if you do play online.  Mostly though, it's the mod hackers who pull out laser guns and can edit any other player's location, appearance or environment that you got to watch out for. You'll also find that Rockstar are very tolerant of these kinds of players, unfortunately.",False

"Hello and welcome what is hopefully my final attempt at completing GTA 5 without taking any damage. I have a max HP of 1 so any damage from any source will immediately kill me. I also want this to be a no-hit run, so Trevor's special ability is disabled. Because while it prevents you from taking damage, it does not prevent you from being hit by things. I have successfully completed every single mission without taking any damage. I should have yet to do it all in one go. My current personal best for an entire run is one bit of damage and therefore one death. Obviously very close to a perfect run, so I'm hoping this time I'll get an actual perfect run and avoid all damage entirely.",True

"The flagship title of ""We won't do anything to maintain this game, but we're going to try to milk every single cent we can out of it."" Every single online lobby has at least one hacker in it. Every. Single. One. Get ready for every 43 year old ""elite gamer"" who's never seen daylight and every 9 year old struggling with the frustration of their parents' divorce to take it out on you in every single lobby you spawn into. You'll be teleported to random places by god moding cheaters who will then proceed to flagellate their micro dicks to killing you over and over again, until you leave that lobby and go find a new hacker to ruin whatever fun you were hoping to have. Go ahead and report them all you want, because in a new feature Rockstar rolled out with this game, they simply won't give a shit! Rockstar will never, *never*, under any circumstances, ban a griefer who is openly modding in an online lobby, but if you should ever find an exploit that allows you to make money quickly without your obligatory tithe to the almighty Shark Card, you can expect your account to be reset and/or banned within the hour.  Money exploits are patched instantly. High payout missions will be immediately nerfed. Any possible chance of having fun in this game will be immediately identified by Rockstar's elite teams and removed before you can actually get the idea that maybe this is a fun game. But the guy who's spawning yachts in the middle of the city and setting you on fire over and over again in combat free zones will never, *never* be banned. That's a Rockstar guarantee.",False

"I cannot believe this game is turning 10 years old.  Even if you dislike open world games, even if you prefer another GTA title over this one, and despite the pit that is GTA Online and the downright disgusting and disrespectful treatment towards fans and modders from Take-Two Interactive, there is no denying just how special Grand Theft Auto V is.  This absolute beast of a game in single player still feels like the most rich, beautiful and entertaining open world game ever made; even after having finished it on all 7th and 8th gen consoles and PC.  From excitedly coming home from school on September 17th 2013 to a freshly collected pre-order for the Xbox 360, to reluctantly buying this game a fifth time on Steam in 2023, every playthrough feels like a fresh experience. Whether it be the order in which I tackle main and side missions, a new detail I never noticed previously, a random event I don't recall or never discovered, switching up my approach to a heist, a radio song making action in the moment more impactful or just finding a new way to make my own fun out in free roam; GTA V is a timeless masterpiece and I think I'll be revisiting even another decade down the line, even if GTA VI tops it.

I really love the game! This is how I still remember it back in 2017 when I had a PC that could run this on 60Fps. I really wish that you could download Online & Story Mode Separately so that the low end gamers or low storage doesn't have to delete anything I remember this was 37gb or something but worth it!,True
"Story is good.  Online is OK. Everything's expensive, but if you're into business development, covert heist operations, and drug empire type stuff, the grind can be fun. In public lobbies, expect toxic players and some destructive (most of the time) modders. The upcoming release of GTA 6 is likely going to slow things down development wise. Expect minor bugs, nothing game breaking.",True

"I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father, and probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories.  Thank you",True

"GTA V's story mode is an absolute masterpiece of gaming narrative. With its captivating characters, compelling plot, and immersive gameplay, Rockstar Games has created an unforgettable experience. Stepping into the shoes of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, players are taken on a thrilling journey through the crime-ridden world of Los Santos. The seamless switching between the three protagonists and the exhilarating heist missions make the gameplay engaging.  Beyond the main storyline, the game offers a plethora of sidequests and activities, adding to the richness of the experience. The production is top-notch with a stunning open-world environment and graphics that seem to sand strong to this day. GTA V's story mode sets the bar high for gaming narratives and is a must-play for both series fans and newcomers.",True

"As a new player of Grand Theft Auto V, I must admit that I was blown away by the sheer scale and detail of the game. Rockstar Games truly delivered an open-world masterpiece that leaves players immersed in a virtual playground of crime, action, and adventure.  Graphics: 9.5/10 The graphics are stunning, with a vibrant and lifelike portrayal of Los Santos. The city feels alive, and the attention to detail in both urban and countryside environments is impressive.  Gameplay: 9.5/10 The gameplay is diverse and engaging, with a compelling storyline that features three unique protagonists. The open-world design allows for unparalleled freedom, offering a wide range of activities and missions to enjoy. The combat mechanics are solid and satisfying, providing an adrenaline-pumping experience during intense moments.  Multiplayer Experience: 9/10 The seamless transition between single-player and GTA Online mode enhances the social aspect of the game. Co-op missions and competitive activities provide endless fun, though the competitive nature of the GTA Online community might be intimidating for new players.  Character Progression and Customization: 9/10 The character progression system and customization options add depth and personalization to the game. Players can grow and improve their characters, making them uniquely their own within the vast world of Los Santos.  Learning Curve: 8.5/10 The game's immense scale can be overwhelming for newcomers, leading to a slightly steep learning curve. Understanding the controls and mechanics takes time, but the rewarding gameplay makes it worth the effort.  Mature Content: 8/10 GTA V's portrayal of a gritty and realistic world occasionally pushes the boundaries with mature content and themes. While it adds to the game's authenticity, it may not be suitable for all players.  Overall, as a new player of GTA V, I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Los Santos. The game's vast open world, engaging storyline, and plethora of activities kept me entertained for hours on end. Grand Theft Auto V is an iconic title that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest open-world games of all time. Whether you're a fan of action, exploration, or simply want to create chaos in a virtual world, GTA V delivers an experience like no other.",True

"I'm gonna quote Todd Howard ""It just doesn't work!"".   Playing this piece of dogsh*t for a long time, you realize how many easy things they've missed the mark on. Quality of life updates are absolutely absent, they make this game so unneedingly tidious. And if you're playing this solo then don't. I dunno what's more depressing, playing online solo or playing LoL. Singleplayer is enjoyable and satisfying but the online experience is straight whack. Don't get me even started on the community, where in every major lobby there's somehow someone with cheats and a modmenu. Every. Single. Time. Updates are getting alot staler with no heists or bigger activities added. K/D is now only affected by 1v1 duels. Ingame inflation is worse than in real life (how the F*ck). They just remove vehicles and content and then drip feed said content to GTA+ subscribers. Expect the grind to get worse year-on-year with smaller and smaller updates. The loading is slow, starting jobs/activities is slow, can't kick any nuisance since there isn't a feature for kicking yet. Man, eff dis shiii- They had to kill Red Dead Online to have GTA Online comatosed.",False

"Grand Theft Auto V is an open-world action game with a variety of different gamemodes. The game features a single-player story and an online world which has received many updates and improvements over the years. Although GTA online has been receiving countless updates, R* still hasn't managed to do anything about a cheater problem. There are many other problems in GTA online besides cheaters including griefers, long loading times and forced co-op work. Many features to ease out solo player have however been added to the game but still at least a one friend is required to unlock and enjoy all the activities the game contains.  [h1]Gameplay[/h1] [b]Story[/b]: There are three protagonists ([i]Michael, Franklin and Trevor[/i]) and the story follows their criminal life. Can't say if I enjoyed the story or not since I have yet to finish it.  [b]Missions and Heists ([i]online[/i])[/b]: There are a lot of missions in GTA online some of which can be completed solo while others require 2 or even 4 people. Heists have a couple of setup missions and the whole heist usually takes around an hour to complete. Single missions however take somewhere between 5-20 minutes each. There are nowadays sort of mini-heists introduced in tuners update which have 2 setups and take around 20-40 minutes to complete.  [b]Unbalanced enemies ([i]online[/i])[/b]: The missions and heists have very different enemies especially if we compare and old mission to a new one. A lot of the enemies are quite easy ([i]cops for example[/i]) to defeat but then there are few missions where the enemies just straight up murder you from a mile away. Doomsday heists are a pretty good example of a very difficult enemies. However a civilian with a car is the most dangerous enemy in the entire game. It is just simply impossible to know what they are going to do. They might for example randomly run you down or head on collide with you on a motorway.  [b]Unbalanced payouts ([i]online[/i])[/b]: As mentioned previously there a many mission and heists. Most of the missions have a horrible payout for amount of time they take to complete. Some of the heists are a perfect example of this. Let's take two heists for example which both take around one hour to complete, other pays $500,000 and the other pays $1,500,000. I wonder which one I should play hmm... oh... I forgot to mention that the first heist requires 4 players while they second can be completed solo. There are also shark cards that can be bought to gain some extra money. But the payouts of those ([i]including the slight increase a while ago[/i]) are even more horrible than some of the missions. For example the biggest shark card costs $75 and that will give you $10,000,000 in game which doesn't sound too bad. However when you take a look of what you can actually buy with it is like 3 cars and maybe a shirt. You can just as easily save your $75 and make the $10,000,000 in game in like 5-8 hours while having some fun with the process.  [b]Properties and Vehicles ([i]online[/i])[/b]: There are a lot of vehicles in GTA online some of which you are still able to buy anytime due to recent changes. Most of the vehicles however cannot be bought anymore from the websites but have to either be bought from a dealership or win as a prize when they appear ([i]dealership deals and prizes change once a week[/i]). There are also a lot of properties in the game most of which you have to own to play some of the missions and heists. Pricing of the properties is somewhat balanced but pricing of the vehicles is not. There are for example a lot of over $2,000,000 cars which are absolutely garbage to drive. I seriously recommend new players to watch some guides before buying anything ([i]vehicles mostly[/i]).  [b]Cheaters and Griefers ([i]online[/i])[/b]: GTA online has a lot of cheaters and griefers. Some of the cheaters however are harmless but most are not and they will try to ruin everyone's experience playing the game. I wouldn't recommend anyone to play in a public lobby for this reason. Don't lose faith in the game just because the community is what it is.  [h1]Would I recommend this game?[/h1] - Yes ([i]wouldn't really play over 2000 hours otherwise[/i]). - Definitely worth it if on sale, the game has many problems but still a great game underneath. - Don't, in the love of god, buy shark cards.",True

"Just to be clear, I'm leaving this review for GTA Online. I haven't given the story a try, so if you're looking to purchase for the single player, disregard this review.  GTAO is not worth playing anymore, at any price. The content is great, and there aren't any games that really scratch the same itch (including RDRO), but the game is so unstable that I can't recommend anyone try it if they don't already own it. Half of your time is spent actually getting into a lobby, between long load times and straight up crashes/freezes. Once your in, you might also find that content just doesn't work or is difficult to actually access (multiple times I'll load into a lobby to find that I can't launch my Securoserve or Motorcycle Club, for example). And even then, when everything is working, every single lobby is filled with hackers/modders. This is not hyperbole, I legitimately have not played a lobby without someone spamming booming noises trying to get me to buy GTA$ or spawning NPCs to murder me or any other number of griefing hacks.  You can eventually get the game to function and when it does it's fantastic. Like I said before GTAO's content is fantastic and incredibly unique, but to get to the gameplay you have to wade through an ocean of dogshit. If you're considering picking up this game just to play Online, look elsewhere. GTAO is no longer worth your time.",False

"Coming up on 10,000 hours in this game. I can safely say it has taught me programming.  I used GTA:V as a stepping stone over 5 years to teach me a lot of programming concepts, and explore various technologies by building multiplayer experiences through alternative multiplayer frameworks such as alt:V and FiveM.  This game has had a profound effect on my life through third-party multiplayer mods and it took me at hour 9,000 to actually play the single player of this game. I never even bothered with the story because I was so enthralled by writing small game modes using alternative clients.  As a programmer, or someone who wants to become a programmer. Take a look at some the alternative mods because they can teach you a lot. I've since moved on to game development.  This game jump started my professional career as a software engineer.",True

"I've never been a fan of GTA. As a kid, I played a few titles like GTA: Vice City and GTA: San Andreas, but they never really held my interest for long. I quickly lost interest, to put it shortly. However, this year (although now I regret not doing it earlier), I decided to give GTA V a chance, and I don't regret it at all. I always used to say that GTA games are senseless, just mindless chaos, car thefts, and being a ruthless serial killer - I mean... I still partly think that, but this time, I set aside my prejudices and fell in love with GTA V. The story, characters, Los Santos, side activities, attention to detail, dialogues, all of it just keeps me hooked! Every hour spent in GTA V brings me a lot of laughter and gives me so much fun. I haven't tried Online yet; for now, I'm having a blast in Story Mode. I've heard that Online mode is for masochists and people with nerves of steel, who have to deal with hackers/modders in their everyday gaming. Maybe someday, I'll join that Online community and see how strong my mental state is. Anyway, I recommend this masterpiece to everyone.",True

"While it is a great game its completely ruined by the fact that rockstar has seemingly given up on the battle against hackers and the game is in a complete state of dismay. The only way to enjoy this game is solo or a private lobby, as the hackers have managed to hit new extremes that I have never seen in any other game ever. Hackers were able to start screen recording on my pc, and play audio loops I couldnt stop and it honestly makes me question if this game is even safe to play as it maybe allowing hackers access to my pc. I'd understand a bit more if gta 6 was out but this is still the most relevant title in the series and they are just letting them destroy it.",False

And if you don’t play, then just arrange a pogrom on the streets or in the open spaces of a large open world. Even now, the elaboration of the surrounding world is impressive. Even the seabed is detailed. The game has an interesting storyline of three characters that is just fun to play. It's also fun to explore the world. If you are a fan of this series of games, you definitely need to play this game. It's better than reading too many words.  I definitely recommend this game to everyone!",True

This game is a mess without a mod menu, mostly for protection from all the losers with a god complex on a 10 year old game crashing you, kicking you, greifing you with endless explosions from anywhere in the map, spawning on you to kill you, etc. Now, thanks to rockstar's infinite laziness, pc doesn't get any good updates, everything is for the 15th generation of console this game has been on (and people talk crap about skyrim) and all because cock star refuses to do anything about their security and is hiding behind the console's security to fix their shit game.",False

single player has a decent campaign not the best rockstar has done but not the worse the theme is still in par with the Grand theft auto series as a whole probably one of the better gta games the GTA online is riddled with bugs and problems that rockstar just flat out doesn't fix the game has tons of hackers and modders that break the game and deletes or removes your ability to enjoy the game and there is an endless cash grab trying to get players to ignore the core reason for gtaonline and just buy your self in game money to bypass your lack of skills to gain the money neccessary. that aside the adition of private mission playable area's are a blessing on a broken system though modders can still ruin your day by blowing you up and harrasing you it is a mass action not a targeted harassment. you just log out and not play for a few days and they may have gotten bored and left.,True

"Played GTA online for about 3 or 4 hours. Some hacker put some device on my character like a jetpack and my character would fly out-of-control and die non-stop, even after reviving. Online = 10/10 (for the hackers)  Although the singleplayer story mode is kinda cool.   But Rockstar have a multiplayer mode that only works for hackers.  Will you play story mode? Go for it, buy the game.  Will you buy to play multiplayer? Don't buy it.  Edit: A friend told me how to create private sessions in the online mode. For this reason I recommend the game now.",True

"Do you like Grand Theft Auto V? I've been a big Rockstar Games fan ever since the release of their 2001 masterpiece, Grand Theft Auto III. Before that, I really didn't understand any of their work. It was too quirky for my taste. But when GTA III came out in '01, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.  The whole game has a clear, crisp graphics, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the gameplay a big boost. It's been compared to Saints Row, but I think GTA has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor.  In 2013, Rockstar Games released this; Grand Theft Auto V, their most accomplished game yet. I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Three Leaf Clover"", a mission where your character robs a bank. The mission is extremely intense and by the time it ends, it has an emotional resonance that's very hard to shake. It's a perfect encapsulation of the narrative strength of the game, something Rockstar has perfected. It's about breaking the law, but on a deeper level, it's a devastating critique of the capitalist machinery that drives our society.  The game's graphics, especially in the Los Santos city, are so bright and incredibly detailed that they really highlight the game's underlying message of the falseness of the American Dream. This isn't just a great action-adventure game, it's a great sociopolitical statement.  But I also think Grand Theft Auto V works because of its three-dimensional characters. Michael, a retired bank robber, is a vivid portrayal of a man struggling with the emptiness of success. Franklin, a young hustler, showcases the struggles of someone trying to escape the harsh realities of urban life. And Trevor, the game's most anarchic figure, provides a chilling glimpse into the psyche of a true sociopath. It's this trifecta of perspectives that makes the game a standout in the gaming industry.  The online multiplayer mode is fun, a great way to blow off steam, and also quite addicting. It adds to the replayability of the game, making it more than worth its price.  You can tell that Rockstar Games was really firing on all cylinders here, because the game's breadth and depth are almost staggering. Every mission feels meticulously crafted, every character brims with life, every satirical jab hits its mark. In terms of sheer scope and ambition, there's really nothing else quite like it.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V's immersive narrative, top-notch gameplay mechanics, and cutting satirical humor make it not just a standout title in the Grand Theft Auto series, but also a high watermark in the history of video gaming. It's only in the context of this complete artistic statement that the brilliance of the game truly shines through.",True

"Honestly, unless you are willing to put an extra $20 (MINIMUM) into a decent mod menu, this game is not worth it. The state of PC GTA in 2023 is pretty rough, with roughly half of every lobby having cheats in some capacity (not hyperbole, genuinely at least 50% of every public lobby you get into).  If you are really dead-set on riding the 2013 nostalgia train, I do encourage you to look up ""Stand Free"". Stand Menu offers the ""Protections"" portion of their mod menu to everyone completely for free. This, at the very least, will stop most Griefing, Kicking, or Crashing methods, and it will make your GTAO experience in 2023 at least tolerable.",False

Their interactions and relationships are incredibly well-written, and the voice acting is top-notch, bringing the characters to life in a way that feels natural and authentic. Whether you love them or loathe them, the characters in GTA 5 leave a lasting impression that will stay with you long after you've completed the game. One of the most impressive aspects of GTA 5 is the seemingly endless amount of content and activities it offers. Beyond the main storyline, the game is teeming with side missions, random encounters, and a myriad of recreational options. From adrenaline-pumping heists to leisurely rounds of golf or tennis, there's always something to do in Los Santos. The online multiplayer mode, GTA Online, takes the experience to a whole new level, allowing players to team up with friends and explore the vast open world together.

Ignoring the constant game breaking bugs and rampant server issues, this game can be fun.

Cheats include invincibility, teleportation, killing every player in their vicinity or every player in the lobby, kicking everyone from the lobby, transporting everyone in the lobby to a location or specific players to locations, changing it so that it looks like they didn't kill everyone, etc. This doesn't mention how cheaters can openly talk about cheating in chat or how bots will destroy your eardrums by announcing cheats and money for sale to the entire lobby. This especially matters in a game based upon money where cheating can ruin hours of hard work and patience. Until rockstar cares about the player, this game will remain unplayable.",False

"I'm gonna be honest here, GTA V is an amazing game that I skipped out on for years, and after playing it, I can guarantee that the singleplayer story was fun, and messing around offline was also fun, the game's pretty good in that regard.  However, I bought the game in the hopes of playing the Online mode with friends, and ran into a brick wall.  Rockstar requires you to use its Social Club to log into Online mode, and while I hate the use of a separate launcher and service when I already have Steam, I just ignored it and kept going.  That wouldn't be a problem if I could actually log into Online mode, because whenever I tried, it'd display ""Social Club is offline - Sorry, Rockstar Game Services are unavailable...""  This wasn't during any downtime in the servers I know of, mind you, this was over the course of several days, and as far as I see, it is an issue that hits a good few people.  I tried every suggestion I could find to fix the issue - restarting my computer, a clean reinstall of the Rockstar Launcher, a clean reinstall of GTA V, fiddling with my firewall settings, tinkering with the DNS settings, and even what Rockstar suggests, and nothing worked.  I could log into the launcher and play singleplayer, but I couldn't even log in in-game.  As far as I can see, the game is just fucked - sure, I can replay the story, but I bought this to play with friends, not to play alone.  In short, buy this at your discretion - it's a fun game, but if you run into the same issue I have, good luck getting past it.  I know some of these fixes work for a few people, but in most cases, I'd wager those're flukes.",False

Rockstar Games has crafted a crime-filled masterpiece that continues to captivate players with its compelling characters, dynamic gameplay, and an ever-evolving online experience.  A Triple Protagonist Experience: GTA V introduces a unique storytelling approach, allowing players to step into the shoes of three diverse protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor.

However, the modding scene is in one of the worst state I've ever seen in a community. Modding the game is tedious and most of the mods are paywalled using patreon. Its funny these entitled modders think they deserve compensation for manipulating another companies assets, using software developed by said company to hold their hand through the process. Its literally the easiest job in gaming developement and you dont deserve a penny. Also, charging money for mods is breaking TOS and Illegal. I will be reporting your mods and patreons to Rockstar so good luck!",False

Honestly a good game but the Social Club and online are so useless when Steam exists. Why do I need another online service for a game that's amazing offline but just turns into random nonsense that begs for more money to ruin everything. Certainly worth full price even as GTA6 is coming up but there's no reason to spend more money just to play with the bloat that is GTA Online. At least it has an online while Red Dead is only good until you beat the game once. Point is I've had more frustrations than I ever needed because of things that are not the single player.,False

"GTAV through Steam is actualy my second purchase of GTA 5.  I lost my first complete GTA 5 install due to malicious modders. I lost more than two hundred dollars worth of shark card purchases, many, many millions in gta money , real estate, autos, and planes. Over ten years worth of gaming hours and accumulated assets an RP were lost when a modder stole my on-line identity and Rockstar has failed to recover it for me. If you buy GTA for the PC you can expect relentless harassment by modders who can do to you what they did to me and Rockstar can not do a thing to stop them. If you do buy the game, you can also google and check out the Kiddions mod menu. It is a free menu system that allows you to spawn most of the vehicles in the game for use in the current session.  It is a fun game to play on those rare occasions when there are no modders and no one trying to sell you menus to further ruin your enjoyment. Just dont invest more your hard earned money on the game than you want to potentialy lose in an instant.",False

Even with or without friends it is still fun.  I think my only complaint would be the fact that most of my friends who do play GTA, play on Xbox so because I have a GTA 5 Xbox account, I hate having to always switch between accounts. And, I wish Rockstar implemented the feature of account linking, but hopefully they do that when GTA 6 releases.   But until then, enjoy having a blast with GTA 5!",True

"Whenever you play this game online, there are atleast 2 modders in every server and they ruin the game for everyone. Doesnt matter you report them, they are never getting banned. %95 of the modders are chinese and they cant even speak english the slightest. They just attack people, put them in cages, teleport them to random places, explode them out of nowhere (literally killing every player in the server at the same time), splashing you with water and chain-stunning you until you die etc... When you try to report them, your game crashes. They can even kick your from the servers like an admin. Do you know what rockstar did? They released a special DLC for the new console players like people who own a PS5. Rockstar doesn't care about PC players, literally. These modders have been in the game for 5 years straight. PC players have been complaining about the modders for years and they release a special DLC for PS5 and XBOX Series X/S. They are almost saying ""f you"" to PC players, Im just done. Never buying a rockstar game ever again. Please dont tell me to go invite only server, its pointless to play online when i play solo in a server. Its not my responsibility to get these servers cleaned from cheaters. Rockstar is the greediest game company ever existed. To the people who wants to get the game : just dont. Its a waste of time. You are like the aim training of players who use godmode and they just ruin your game all day. If you want to play single players, its so null and basic. Not worth it.",False

Every part of this mode is made to frustrate players. 10 years of layered crap content also make mess in whole game. Even UI is a mess. Inflation is eating this game. Do not buy.

"Bought specifically to play GTA online, just to check it out after 10 odd years not touching it. Needless to say it hasn't changed much. The Online experience is plagued with cheaters, currency selling spam bots that destroy your eardrums and content solely tailored towards group play. I'm getting old already and my friends don't have time to sit down with me for a 5 hour GTA session. But honestly, I'm just not interested in tailoring my time around others. So I've been playing private lobbies. Fine, whatever, but this leads me to the content offered to my level 15 (only because some hacker was in my first game and was apparently giving everyone xp and cash every little while.) After the tutorial mission with Lamar, you're literally thrown into overwhelming positions and or missions you have no means to deal with.  -Mission to go steal van that has drugs in it. Sure, np. Nick the van and get chased and gunned down by 4 chasing vehicles because only have a pistol. Death, mission failed but hey, got points and money.... Real fun.  -Next I accept some of the criminal empire pack that came bundled with the game. F-ing clueless. So I pick CEO of the bank instead of leader of Bike gang. Take my first mission after spending about 10%  of my networth on bank and warehouse. One crate of narcotics, sweet. Just go and pick it up, there might be some resistance but I've spent some money at a gun van earlier and bought a decent rifle. Head towards the drop, Mayweather has intervened and taken off... IN A HELICOPTER?? The f........ Chased helicopter around for 20 minutes shooting at it with my rifle cause wtf else was I supposed to do? Of course it does nothing and fail because of timer. Half an hour wasted doing nothing but losing money.  I'm sure it's a good game played in a group. But as a ""new"" solo player just jumping in to explore content for the first time it was by far one of the worst online experiences I have ever encountered. The most fun I had was in the dressing room trying to make  my female avatar more pleasant to look at. The rest was stress, frustration and ultimately disappointment.  Not totally sure what I was expecting. Something along the lines of the single player with the option to run with other players. Of course I'll be (or at least trying to be) checking out more content but HS, after 10 years. This really shows the incompetence (or neglect?) of Rockstar.  Edit: The single player is as good as it was on release.. but that's it. Any and all content released for this game since, has been for GTA online. So if you want a true solo experience you're gated to very limited content. The push to live service is obvious, they can milk people for money but always multiplayer all the time spoils the experience. Be it trolls, spam, cheaters/hacks. It's just unappealing. There's a reason why genuine MMOs and singleplayer online games like Genshin and Honkai cater to solo players.",False

BARRY BENSON: (Barry is picking out a shirt) Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.  : Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. JANET BENSON: Barry! Breakfast is ready! BARRY: Coming!  : Hang on a second. (Barry uses his antenna like a phone)  : Hello? ADAM FLAYMAN:  (Through phone) - Barry? BARRY: - Adam? ADAM: - Can you believe this is happening? BARRY: - I can't. I'll pick you up. (Barry flies down the stairs)  : MARTIN BENSON: Looking sharp. JANET: Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. BARRY: Sorry. I'm excited. MARTIN: Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.  : A perfect report card, all B's. JANET: Very proud. (Rubs Barry's hair) BARRY= Ma! I got a thing going here. JANET: - You got lint on your fuzz. BARRY: - Ow! That's me!  JANET: - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! (Barry flies out the door) JANET: Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!

Special day, graduation. ADAM: Never thought I'd make it. (Barry pulls away from the house and continues driving) BARRY: Three days grade school, three days high school... ADAM: Those were awkward. BARRY: Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM== You did come back different. (Barry and Adam pass by Artie, who is jogging) ARTIE: - Hi, Barry!  BARRY: - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. ADAM: - Hear about Frankie? BARRY: - Yeah. ADAM== - You going to the funeral? BARRY: - No, I'm not going to his funeral.  : Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.  : Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. ADAM: I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. (The car does a barrel roll on the loop-shaped bridge and lands on the highway)  : I love this incorporating an amusement park into our regular day. BARRY: I guess that's why they say we don't need vacations. (Barry parallel parks the car and together they fly over the graduating students) Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances.

You also have people that try and trick you and pull you into helping them with Setups for heists, but then most won't even invite you to the actual heist, leading you to not really want to help people with more of their setups.",False

"If this was 2013, and Obama was still president, I'd give GTA V a 10/10. But it's not 2013 anymore. And Rockstar Games refuses to leave this relic behind for newer titles due to pure greed.   GTA Online is a bloated, shameless, scam of a game that becomes more and more ridiculous with it's greed with with every update. Now they're removing hundreds of previously purchasable cars to put them behind a subscription service. If this was EA or Activision, Angry Joe and The Act Man would be leading a gamer mob to their headquarters. But Rockstar always gets a pass. And this has had dire consequences for gaming.  The fact that GTA V has been milked as long as it has, and red dead online, the supposed ""greatest game ever"" according to Kotaku journalists, had its online mode abandoned so early, has sent a clear message to Rockstar and take two that they can do whatever they want, and nobody will stop them. No amount of despicable anti consumer practices will ever be punished because ""omg guys, GTA VI might come out one day!""   I hate the legacy GTA V, and GTA Online have left for gaming. It sent a clear message to scumbag AAA developers that this kind of nonsense would be tolerated. Just look at Overwatch 2, or anthem, or cyberpunk, or sea of thieves, or no man's sky, or battlefront 2. This is all a result of a post GTA online landscape.

When i was just 4 years old i was already playing GTA IV. with like 7 i started playing GTA V on my brothers PS3, then PS4 abd now PC and PS5. God knows how many years later im still here playing this game.   Story: 10/10 Full with Action, and really good storytelling.  Graphics: PS3: 8/10 for its time it was advanced PS4: 7/10 It has good graphics but PS5 and PC: 10/10 becouse even tho this used to be a PS3 game and is over 10 years old, the graphics are amazing on these two platforms.  Gameplay: 10/10 it just feels amazing, without doubt the best gameplay i had ever seen, untill RDR2 came out.  DLCs: 5/10 used to be amazing but got let down by Rockstar Games and now the new DLCs are just boring. 2 DLCs every year, one in summer and one in winter.  Overall: 8/10 Its just an amazing game i grew up with and even learned a whole language from. If you are thinking about buying it to play the story, do it, its worth it. Online is fun, but buying the game alone for the story is enough. I bought some VR glasses, and later found out that you can play this game with a mod in VR. I played the whole story in VR, it was just amazing.  Thank you Rockstar Games for this title, you made my childhood.  (and Leon even tho we planned to make Operation Militarybase when we was in 3. grade, ad you cant park the Jet you stole in your garage even tho we thought we chould, we have to do it one day (WHEN YOU FINALLY GET YOUR PC))   -Blxfroxt",True

"Shitton of stuff is thrown right at you, and you have no idea where to start, what to do, what is there available from the very beginning, how to start some random DLC RGB LBGT+ update that came out 4 years ago, 3/4 of content requires other people to play.  Your phone is constantly spammed with random bullshit of new stuff unlocked available blah blah blah. UI is horrible, making even Ubisoft design team look good in comparison.   In my 5 hours of playing this, I've managed to rob a few stores, complete 1 race, steal an RV and deliver it to some place, also got a free house and an armored car.   Whats my objective? How to progress the game? Nah, dude, you dont need that, so basically here is some random popup that sends you to a mission with $6000 award.   Jesus Christ, what a mess.",False
"TLDR: The game WAS great. Online isn't worth trying to get into if you haven't already. But, if you just want a fun singleplayer story campgain, the game is still acceptable.   At its core, this game is timeless. It's fantastic for wasting time, whether you enjoy roaming around in singleplayer with a mod menu (or playing the campaign) or screwing around in gta online with friends, but the recent monetization updates have really been trying to kill the online aspect of gta. If you are a new player and you are unwilling to purchase money through shark cards or other micro transactions, it's really not worth trying to get into. And even if you are willing to spend the extra money, be prepared to deal with infinite black screen loading bugs (brought on by modders in the lobby) and other griefing from hackers and modders. And even if you get lucky enough to not be in a lobby with them, good luck avoiding idiots riding flying bikes and shooting you with missiles just because you exist in the lobby.",False

"I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, my son invited me and he took us into a casino heist.. I was a bit confused about the games mechanics and so I asked my Son for help. my son hosted a game for me to join so he could teach me how to drive a car and how to purchase weapons, we had an absolute blast. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",True

"The friends were imperfect in one way or another, so they helped each other to fill what they were lacking and embarked on a journey to make their wishes come true. The Scarecrow wanted a brain, the  Tin Woodsman wanted a heart, the Cowardly Lion wanted courage, and Dorothy  wanted to return home.  The one they thought to be the great wizard instead gave the Woodsman a lead heart.  ""But you're a machine, that means you were built to serve humans. Don't you understand? Machines don't need a heart. Good job making it all the way here though, take this as compensation. Be sure to tell  everyone waiting for you that your wish definitely came true.""  Some left with satisfaction. The friends departed and were never to be seen again. The hard, cold lead was depressing.   The Tin Woodsman couldn't agree with this. In anger, he swung his axe through the wizard's heart. The warm heart was pulsing vigorously. He shoved the lead into the wizard's now empty chest. For the first time in his life, the Woodsman started laughing at the sight, and felt a pleasure he'd never had before.  Grabbing a chunk of mushy hearts, he shoves it into his ""chest."" There will never be enough hearts. Once a Woodsman, he now cuts down people instead of trees. This is a forest full of hearts. No matter how many he cuts down, the forest still remains dense. A kind person would carry a warmer heart.  When the heart is lost, the Woodsman will fall to his knees in sorrow, clutching his empty chest. As if begging for the only thing he has left not to be taken",True

"GTA V is a game that has quickly become a classic, offering a one-of-a-kind open-world gaming experience. With an engaging storyline and well-developed characters, the game offers a story that you can follow through the eyes of three different protagonists.  The game is beautifully designed, with cinematic-quality graphics and an impressive soundtrack. The Los Santos environment is large, varied, and offers an immersive experience you won't want to leave. There's so much to do in the open world of GTA V, you could spend hours just exploring, biking, golfing, and more.  The multiplayer mode, GTA Online, is also offered fun, providing a different gameplay experience than the single-player campaign. You can create your own character, buy properties, run errands, participate in heists and many other online activities with your friends.  All in all, GTA V is an exciting, beautifully crafted and action-packed game that delivers an unforgettable gaming experience. With an engaging storyline, memorable characters, cinematic-quality graphics, and an outstanding soundtrack, this game is a modern classic that every gamer should try.

"Fuck Rockstar, fuck Tencent, the fact that this game is so highly reviewed makes me sad. If you're buying the game at this point, DONT. ESPECIALLY if you plan to use GTA Online. Rockstar has proven they do not give a flying fuck about the community, I don't care how good GTA6 might be I am not buying it on principle and you shouldn't either.",False

"I would've recommended this game like 5 years ago. GTA Online is fucking trash. It's sad but not surprising to see that Rockstar took out many vehicles so they can put them in their dumb rotations(i.e. the lucky wheel and ls car meet). I'm tired of jumping through a million hoops to have fun with this game. Don't waste anymore of your time. Rockstar for a while has shown time and time again that they don't give a fuck about their player base, but it doesn't matter because the game is so massive anyway. They will just keep getting away with this shit through the end of this game and probably most of the next one. I have lost hope in this franchise that I once loved. A message Rockstar Games, release GTA 6 and quit milking this game dry you greedy pigs.",False

"When I was installing the game I was already banned, why? because I forgot you aren't allowed to go into Public sessions (THAT ROCKSTAR ADVERTISES) because your the one that gets banned and not the guy with the menu.   Don't worry you still can play the game you were promised but not by the people who created it.

"If you've so much as glanced at GTAV on another platform and linked your social account to it, the Cockstar social club won't let you log in and you'll be told to ""Log in with a different social club user"" to continue. Apparently the technology to give each steam account a unique ID is too advanced. Other users have reported the same issue as well as waiting upwards of two weeks for a response from Cockstar's website, which even by modern AAA standards is unacceptable. If you're fine with owning nothing and being happy this is definitely the game for you.",False

"Single player is this game is fine, It is what you'd expect from a single player ""Crime-Lord"" Game, The ""No"" review is solely for only the online portion of this game.   Online Game-play is so extremely, Abhorrently, reprehensibly awful that is an easy pass, While they make starting up as tier 1 in this game difficult as life itself, you spend half of the time defending yourself from extremely toxic players, some are children and teenagers who have nothing better to do because they have no girlfriend or significant other to be with. anyway as a I digress.  Toxic players, toxic community, whaling is essentially required and is pretty much built into the game if you want to do anything that is worth while in this game. the ""Bad-Sport"" mentality pretty much does nothing to quell people from doing this.   They make the reward so worthless when compared to the risks that YOU DO take in this game. Hackers are not punished or reprimanded enough.   Unless RockShart changes MULTIPLE things that I do not like about this game, DO NOT SPEND YOUR 60$ on it. Or ignore my review like many other probably will and risk breaking your equipment or permanent hair loss from it leaving your head in frustration while playing this game.",False

"Weaker characters compared to the previous entries, a weaker story, lame radio stations, a giant empty map, and 'streamlined' gameplay that essentially boils down to walk and talk missions, escort missions, races and heists. On repeat.  You're also required to use their shitty 3rd party launcher to run the game, which can cause problems if you're trying to run this on a steamdeck or something similar.   The online portion of the game also contains one of the most disgusting and exploitative examples of monetization in a video game.   Overall just a waste of time. You're better off playing any other GTA title.",False

There's so many different races to choose from and so many different enemies to fight as well!! The included multiplayer is also really fun for beginners..

"As an avid gamer and fan of the Grand Theft Auto series, I recently embarked on an adrenaline-fueled journey through the fictional streets of Los Santos in Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this installment, creating an open-world masterpiece that leaves players hooked from the very start.  The first thing that struck me about GTA V is its stunning visuals and attention to detail. The game's graphics are simply breathtaking, and the vast and diverse landscapes of Los Santos, from the bustling urban sprawl to the serene countryside, are meticulously crafted. The level of immersion is unparalleled as the city feels alive, with pedestrians going about their daily routines, AI-controlled cars obeying traffic rules, and dynamic weather effects adding to the overall realism.  The heart of GTA V lies in its captivating storyline, which revolves around three unique protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking redemption; Franklin, a young and ambitious gangster aiming for a better life; and Trevor, a chaotic and unpredictable character with a dark past. The seamless switch between these characters throughout the game allows players to experience the story from various perspectives, making it all the more engrossing.  Rockstar Games has excelled in creating characters that feel genuine, flawed, and relatable. Their development over the course of the game is nothing short of remarkable, drawing players emotionally closer to the narrative. The writing is sharp, laced with dark humor and unexpected twists that keep players constantly on their toes.  What truly sets GTA V apart is the sheer freedom it offers within its open-world environment. Players can engage in a plethora of activities, from taking on thrilling heists and daring missions to participating in various side quests and recreational endeavors. The world is your playground, and whether you're racing cars, playing golf, base jumping, or indulging in a game of tennis, there's never a dull moment.  The game's online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online, adds another layer of excitement to the already content-rich experience. With regular updates and a thriving community, the multiplayer aspect ensures that players will be entertained for countless hours beyond the main storyline.  However, it's worth noting that GTA V is intended for mature audiences due to its explicit content, violence, and language. While it contributes to the authenticity of the game's setting, parents should exercise caution and consider the game's rating before allowing younger players to delve into it.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is an exceptional masterpiece in the gaming industry. With its breathtaking graphics, engaging narrative, and unparalleled freedom, it sets the benchmark for open-world gaming experiences. Despite being released several years ago, GTA V's enduring popularity speaks volumes about its lasting impact on the gaming community. If you're a fan of action-packed adventures and immersive storytelling, this game is an absolute must-play.",True

"Whilst the game in itself is fun, and the griefers seem to have subsided, modders are still rampant, and can do serious damage. Also, way too much content is made available to you at the beginning, and it can be extremely overwhelming, especially since you aren't given an explanation. Another thing, the game takes an unreasonably long time to load, and it often ends up just stuck in a loop of loading, and when tabbing out whilst loading in, the game may just crash. Heist missions have a tendency to crash a lot as well, so forget about playing one of the main parts of the game.  Singleplayer is ok.  All in all, I'd say get it if it's ever in a better state, or get another game.",False

"Title: An Unforgettable Adventure in Los Santos - GTA V Delivers!  Review: I can't recommend Grand Theft Auto V enough! The open world in this game is absolutely incredible, offering endless possibilities for exploration and excitement. Whether I'm cruising through the bustling streets of Los Santos or venturing into the picturesque countryside, the level of detail is simply astounding.  The missions in GTA V are nothing short of superb. Each one feels unique and brings its own set of challenges and thrills. From high-speed heists to heart-pounding shootouts, the gameplay keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire journey.  And let's talk about the graphics - they are mind-blowing! The attention to detail in every aspect of the game, from the character models to the dynamic weather effects, truly elevates the gaming experience to a whole new level.  I've spent countless hours in Los Santos, and with each playthrough, I discover something new and exciting. The freedom to make choices, coupled with the rich narrative, keeps me coming back for more.  If you're a fan of open-world adventures and enjoy immersive gameplay, GTA V is an absolute must-play. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this masterpiece. So grab your virtual car keys and dive into the world of GTA V - you won't be disappointed!",True

"Unraveling the Tapestry of Los Santos: Grand Theft Auto V  Score: 9.4/10  Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is a technical marvel and narrative powerhouse that marks a high point in the storied history of open-world gaming. This landmark title adeptly weaves a dense tapestry of story, action, and exploration, resulting in a gaming experience that is as provocative as it is fun. With a staggering level of depth and breadth, GTA V earns an impressive 9.4 out of 10.  GTA V's primary narrative is an intricate saga of crime and ambition, set against the backdrop of the sprawling city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas. The plot is made richer by the three protagonists - Michael, Franklin, and Trevor, each with their own distinct personalities and storylines that intertwine brilliantly. The game's bold choice to allow players to switch between these characters at almost any point is innovative and provides a unique and engaging storytelling mechanism.  GTA V's open-world design is a testament to Rockstar's attention to detail and commitment to creating an immersive experience. Los Santos is a living, breathing city with diverse districts that accurately mirror the multicultural fabric of Southern California. From sun-kissed beaches and bustling downtown streets to arid desert expanses and towering mountain ranges, the world feels alive and is an absolute joy to explore.  The gameplay in GTA V offers a perfect balance between chaotic action and strategic planning. Whether you're engaging in high-octane car chases, meticulously planning and executing heists, or simply exploring the city in your downtime, the game constantly keeps you entertained. The cover-based shooting mechanics feel smooth, the driving is satisfyingly responsive, and the sheer variety of vehicles and weapons available adds to the game's replayability.  Graphically, GTA V is stunning. The level of detail, realistic physics, dynamic weather, and day-night cycle create an aesthetically pleasing and believable world. The voice acting is top-notch, and the radio stations with their various genres of music and entertaining talk-show segments significantly add to the game's atmosphere.  Additionally, the inclusion of GTA Online provides a robust and continually evolving multiplayer experience, where players can engage in a plethora of activities, from races and deathmatches to cooperative heists, further extending the game's lifespan.  Nevertheless, the game is not without its flaws. Some may find the game's portrayal of violence and its treatment of certain societal issues controversial. Also, although GTA Online is a rich addition, it occasionally suffers from server issues and an environment that may be unwelcoming to newcomers.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V stands as an exemplar in the realm of open-world games. Its engaging narrative, meticulously crafted world, diverse gameplay mechanics, and compelling multiplayer component make it a game that any player can appreciate. While not without its minor setbacks and potential controversy, the scale and quality of what it offers are undeniable, making GTA V a must-play title in the annals of gaming history.",True

As you'd expect in a GTA game, the driving and car variety is very solid.

"It is no longer recommended for any player to play GTAOL to buy this game. Its life cycle is basically at the end, and the only thing left is lingering and more garbage content. We gave Rockstar a couple of year to improve this game, and his updated content is getting more and more worse. Here is why I don't recommend anyone to buy GTAOL anymore. · Extremely worst online environment If you go to a public session, that is, a session where a group of stranger players are together, there is a high probability that someone will cheat. Even if you hide, you will easily encounter cheats such as teleport all players to a cage to kill you. You will also be unable to press the game menu due to repeated killings. And if you want to play as in private, you can avoid it, but the premise is that you are not targeted by any cheats, otherwise the cheats will always join your session or mission, and then continue to send you to the cage to kill, or crash your game. Even if you never mess with any cheaters, you will encounter ballstorture random invitations (indiscriminate invitations that last for a year, and even forcefully pull players into new sessions) And what’s Rockstar do anything about this? They just simply disabled the function for players to invite public players from private sessions to play missions together. At the same time, players can no longer search for missions enabled in different sessions (it was possible before this update), so players have made so many sacrifices, presumably the problem of cheating has been well improved! As a result, at least million cheats that invite harassment and attack players indiscriminately across the server can be found on the internet everywhere, 1/4 of which is ballstorture! ! ! This is their attitude towards cheating! ! ! They don't even care about cheats that affect the overall situation, and the rest of the minor troublemakers are out of their control. · Extreme disgusting update content If the extremely disgusting environment can be avoided by relying on absolute isolation, then the remaining big problem that you absolutely cannot avoid is the update content that is getting more and more disgusting. If it is said that last summer’s ULP series mission update, there are at least some additional content to praise (hidden contacts, auto store classification options, yes, they dragged it out for almost 10 years), but this year there is almost nothing to praise! The Worst Jobs of Los Santos Drug Wars, It's perfunctory like taking out some small Job separately, and then telling us that this is a big update? Players who may have never played before don’t know what the concept of the usual major task update is. If you don’t consider the update of PVP content, the previous task update is generally Apartment heist, Doomsday heist (the coolest and most sci-fi), Diamond Casino heist, and large-scale heist missions such as Cayo Perico heist. Apartment heist is the number one benchmark in the 4-player cooperation series. It can sneak in or force a sudden attack, and there are many ways to play. And hallucinogens even scored chapters and chapters, and the next chapter was delayed for almost half a year, and even a difficult mode (that is, the chance of resurrection was reduced) had to be squeezed out for several months! Such efficiency is unprecedented and outrageous. Maybe it’s okay to play these trash mission, and you can play some other stuff in the game(such as race or sth), then the next content is definitely the most disgusting. · Extreme disgusting operation mode Grand Theft Auto, charges related to car theft, right? the focus is on stealing and cars, Auto! ! ! In their latest update, they deleted nearly 200 cars! And that number is still growing! What is the reason given by Rockstar? ""Lesser-used vehicles will be removed from in-game websites to streamline the browsing experience"", so, Rockstar must be very concerned about the player's browsing experience, right? Oh, in addition to deleting nearly 200 cars, it is just adding a few categories, and then? Is there a search by name? Are there more filter rules? After viewing a car's introduction, can I stay at the last browsed position when going back to the previous page instead of browsing from the beginning? nothing! A flying motorcycle of 2 million, they increased it to EIGHT MILLION after several price increases, which is equivalent to do The Cayo Perico Heist at least 5 times in a row, and each time it has to be a profit of 1.8 million (equivalent to a single person's exclusive bonus + door glitch + good luck to get the highest value goods enough to fill the backpack), you can afford this vehicle, if you are not so lucky, you have to do The Cayo Perico Heist more times! At the same time, I don’t know what happening with Rockstar. They often launch various garbage missions. Not only are the rewards not good, but the missions are also not good. For example, the last Halloween was limited to collect 200 jack-o’-lanterns for a week, with random effects such as explosions and electric shocks, or collect 100 props. This way of creating ""out of print"" is very disgusting. In order to add a little collection value to their perfunctory clothes, they engage in this kind of disgusting time-limited collection. Whoever does it will be disgusted. They forcefully reflect the difficulty of collecting this piece of clothing to add so-called value. However, I still can't wear it in the mission, which is amazing. There is also the mission editor. They have more and more restrictions on the mission editor. Recently, they even added an item blacklist, which made most of the interesting player-made maps unplayable,Although he was scolded back, no one can guarantee when he will delete it again. In addition, it also limits the player's earning speed. The most profitable Cayo Perico has added a 3-hour CD for single-player clearance and a 48-minute CD for multi-player clearance. Other large-scale jobs have also added a 48-minute CD (mandatory multiplayer). Before the player has fully played, some people may think that limiting the earning speed can allow the player to experience this growth process. However, when faced with a broken gun worth hundreds of thousands (more expensive than many real estates), most people will not dislike the short CD, but only complain about the abnormal inflation in Los Santos. After all, rockstar knows that it is too easy for players to make money and buy things, so they will not buy its GTA+ members and shark cards. · Endless glitches and crashes Various benign glitches in this game help players make more money in jobs. Vicious glitches such as decrease bullets cause players to lose hundreds of thousands of ammunition costs in vain every time, and even game crash and decrease revenue. Rockstar will only repair the former, and the latter is basically left to the community. Fun glitches get fixed, and annoying glitches pile up, never really getting fixed. Such a worse and disgusting online environment is the only one among so many open worlds, and it is getting more and more worse and disgusting! And you know what? I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of content is exclusive to GTA+ members a year from now, especially the 200+ cars that got deleted, because that's something that Rockstar would come up with!",False

"After a long 2-3 hours of wait of download ready to play the game, I ended up in the ''Sign in'' part. Ok, sure why not, I told myself. Signing up my account but then just to be rejected because the account is apparently already linked to their damn social party or whatever that thing is. I did not try to even understand or gave it a second what that second verification was about, clearly had a rough day already and I am not gonna spend 15 minutes trying to figure out why or why not this account is not eligible. Like literally, why do we even need theses to play GTA V on solo/story mode. What are they trying to protect from it via the use of emails or whatever their social group is, I just wanna play the game like any other, just click and play why does it have to be that complicated for something that is not even multiplayer god damn.. (There is multiplayer but I just went for the normal story mode one) Although the game is good, I've played it on my ps4, hopping that I could just play on my computer for 2 hours just to chill. Man it was good time when the Ps3 was out, there was no accounts or such things as gamepasses. Everything was just given in the game since there was no way to put money into it.",False

"Timeless and exceptional, GTA V continues to captivate players even a decade after its release. Its vast open world, engaging storylines, and endless opportunities for mayhem make it an undeniable classic. While we eagerly await the potential arrival of GTA VI, we recommend diving into the immersive world of Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) to satiate your appetite for adventure. However, it's worth acknowledging that some players have expressed concerns about Rockstar's monetization practices, which may leave a bitter taste for some. Nevertheless, GTA V remains a must-play experience for any gaming enthusiast.",True

"Even though I have substantially more hours than what's on my steam due to the fact I've played it most on ps3 and xbox one, I am sitting here writing my dead to right honest review of GTA 5. Although the overall gameplay experience will change as you go from story mode to online play, it is a solid experience. Graphics are smooth and stutter free and quite stunning if you're playing on the highest possible settings, it is quite enjoyable even if you have to settle with lower graphics. I myself am playing on the highest possible settings with my ASUS TUF gaming laptop, it has NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1650 graphics card and AMD Ryzen 5 4600H processor and 32 GB ram (aftermarket custom job as the laptop orginally only has 8GB, but upgrade was nessecary to play newer games without issues) so if you have a computer, either a tower or laptop with similar or higher specs - you are more than capable of playing GTA 5 and enjoying the experience as you go along. Story is detailed and rich in different ways you can take to reach the same goal, added bonus is that you have three characters to choose from and 3 different endings of story mode when you get that far. Loads of possibilities as in how you play the game and spend your time, if you either want to go full sandbox and stunt cars, planes, helicopters or a BMX bite along the mountain side - litteraly only thing stopping you is your own imagination same goes with online play - wanna go full rampage mode, or settle down with owning businesses and earning big bucks by owning a night club etc, the choice is yours. But, there is a big but here. Online play can be good and it can be just as bad, lots of toxic players and just the same amount of hackers and cheaters. However, there is a work around to play online mode and not being lobbied with tons of these by using the resource monitor methode (use google and watch how it is done) I myself am fond of that and have been enjoying online play even more ever since I found out about that. The game is full of surprises and as said earlier, the only thing stopping you is your own imagination. Theres a million different ways to play and if you like the game as much as I have, you will loose lots of hours on it. Bon voyage and enjoy.",True

"Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece of open-world gaming, showcasing Rockstar Games' unparalleled ability to create immersive, exhilarating, and sometimes controversial experiences. Released years ago, it remains an enduring classic that has stood the test of time, captivating players with its dynamic storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and endless possibilities for chaotic fun.  The narrative of Grand Theft Auto V revolves around three distinct protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber living a life of luxury; Franklin, a street-smart hustler eager for bigger opportunities; and Trevor, an unhinged, psychopathic criminal with a penchant for chaos. Their lives intertwine in a gripping tale of heists, betrayal, and self-discovery, drawing players deep into the dark underbelly of Los Santos.  From the moment you set foot in the sprawling city of Los Santos, it becomes apparent that Rockstar has spared no expense in crafting a visually stunning world. The attention to detail is unparalleled, with bustling streets, picturesque landscapes, and vibrant characters breathing life into every corner of the game. The level of realism is astonishing, making you feel like you're an active participant in a living, breathing metropolis.  One of the key highlights of Grand Theft Auto V is its immense open-world freedom. Players are presented with a vast playground where they can engage in an assortment of activities, ranging from adrenaline-pumping heists and high-speed police chases to more casual endeavors like golf, tennis, and stock market trading. The plethora of side missions and mini-games keeps players entertained for hours on end.  The humor and satire embedded in the game's dialogue and radio stations add a layer of wit and charm to the experience. Rockstar's ability to mock various aspects of modern society, politics, and popular culture in an entertaining way is commendable, albeit often controversial.  However, it's worth noting that Grand Theft Auto V is rated M for Mature for a reason. The game is not suitable for younger audiences due to its intense violence, explicit language, and adult themes. Parents should exercise caution and be mindful of the game's content.  Despite its brilliance, the game is not without some minor flaws. The occasional mission difficulty spikes and overly aggressive police AI can be frustrating, but they hardly detract from the overall enjoyment.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains a landmark in gaming history, setting a standard for open-world games that few have matched. Its engrossing narrative, impeccable graphics, and an abundance of activities make it an unforgettable experience. If you have the stomach for mature content and are eager to explore a virtual world like no other, Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute must-play.",True

"It's not as good as I expected. The cars handle poorly and so do the characters on foot. It takes way too much space on the hard drive, and won't work without a designated launcher. Even many years after the premiere it's still very buggy, cars disappear from the garage, characters glitch through the floor and camera tends to clip through walls. The environments are pretty bland, especially the city. Things that deserve praise: the game is pretty easy, it runs smooth, the graphics are nice, and it's compatible with Windows 10. Overall it's missing a lot of charm that previous games in the series had, but it's a decent driving simulator. Update: There's lots of fun mods to improve the game! That makes it worth it!",True

"GTA V is a game that I've known about since it launched but I haven't really been able to play it until around 3 years ago when I got it on console. After buying it for PC and playing through single player again this is what I have to say. The main storyline is fairly solid though a bit convoluted and has a lot going on which is kind of expected when there are 3 main protagonists. Although it's still fun, engaging, and worth your time in my opinion. The online mode on the other hand is a bit of a shitshow. For one, it's very grindy as the payouts for missions and business sales are very low compared to the vehicle and property prices. Another issue is modders who can either ruin your session or lead to a lot of silliness and fun times, and there's almost no inbetween. And with a recent update, Rockstar removed around 180 vehicles from the websites. For reference, the game had somewhere around 700 vehicles before the update. That aside, there are some fun things you can do like rob stores, play PvP, mess around with your friends or random people, etc. All said, this game still holds up pretty well nearly 10 years on and I think it's worth the money especially if you get in on sale.",True

"Chilli con carne recipe  if you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding Chilli con carne recipe you've come to the right place,  Ingredients  1 large onion 1 red pepper 2 garlic cloves 1 tbsp oil 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder (or 1 level tbsp if you only have mild)  1 tsp paprika 1 tsp ground cumin 500g lean minced beef 1 beef stock cube 400g can chopped tomatoes ½ tsp dried marjoram 1 tsp sugar (or add a thumbnail-sized piece of dark chocolate along with the beans instead, see tip)  2 tbsp tomato purée 410g can red kidney beans plain boiled long grain rice, to serve soured cream, to serve  Directions  STEP 1 Prepare your vegetables. Chop 1 large onion into small dice, about 5mm square. The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip, peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways, not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together. Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice.  STEP 2 Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, remove stalk and wash the seeds away, then chop. Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves.  STEP 3 Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat. Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 1-2 minutes until hot (a little longer for an electric hob).  STEP 4 Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly frequently, for about 5 minutes, or until the onion is soft, squidgy and slightly translucent.  STEP 5 Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin.  STEP 6 Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  STEP 7 Brown 500g lean minced beef. Turn the heat up a bit, add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula. The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince.  STEP 8 Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes, until all the mince is in uniform, mince-sized lumps and there are no more pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown, rather than just stew.  STEP 9 Make the sauce. Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water. Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture.   info. This great chilli recipe has to be one of the best dishes to serve to friends for a casual get-together. An easy sharing favourite that uses up storecupboard ingredients. it's also freezable",True

Rockstar Games has outdone themselves with this masterpiece, delivering a captivating and immersive experience that pushes the boundaries of what a video game can achieve.  From the moment you step foot into the sprawling metropolis of Los Santos, you're immediately struck by the stunning attention to detail and the sheer scale of the world. The city is a living, breathing entity, bustling with activity, diverse neighborhoods, and countless secrets to discover. The level of immersion is unparalleled, with the realistic visuals, dynamic weather systems, and an impressive day-night cycle that brings the city to life.  GTA V offers an unforgettable narrative experience, masterfully interweaving the lives of three distinct protagonists: Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. Each character has their own compelling story arc, motivations, and unique abilities. The writing is top-notch, filled with sharp dialogue, memorable moments, and unexpected twists that keep you engaged and invested in their journeys.

The controls are smooth and responsive, allowing for seamless navigation through the city streets and intense action sequences. The game offers a staggering amount of activities and missions, ranging from high-octane heists and thrilling car chases to leisurely pastimes like golf, tennis, and even skydiving. The sheer variety ensures that there's always something exciting to do, catering to a wide range of player preferences.  One of the most impressive aspects of GTA V is its dynamic and living world. The AI-driven NPCs go about their daily routines, creating an authentic sense of immersion.

"Wow writing a Steam review for GTA V in 2023, somethings never change. Well I've been playing this since it came out and online didn't even exist. Lets talk post release shall we, Online has been a major success the story is just a faster way to load into the game now sorta. Lets talk about the goods, since release of online play there's been so much added from property and vehicles to the actual content and missions even just customizing your character and running business's like some sort of tycoon lots to come back for every so often. Unfortunately every good comes with a bad, from missions lagging out or your game just all out disconnecting and kicking you out to stare at steam library stage. I have even had missions all out not pay me after completing the objectives. This is especially annoying because everything in this game is so damn expensive and I cant for any reason understand why. For any new car you'll need to complete at least 2 heists to afford it and that's assuming everyone's either down to not get paid more or down to give you more money than the other 3 members. I'm of course talking about the 3 other people you're doing a heist with. Unfortunately hackers and modders are the real troopers keeping this game alive, almost every lobby you join will have at least one. Normally you just have to wait out 20 minutes of them murdering you and sweet talk them in public chat and they'll give ya a hand out or at least let you ride around in their modded vehicle wreaking havoc. Anyways having spent the past 2 weeks just really grinding out this game in slew of excitement for the GTA VI announcement trailer I find myself enjoying the game a lot.",True

"GTA 5, also known as ""Grand Theft Auto V,"" is not just a game; it's a wild rollercoaster ride through the world of crime and mayhem, with a dash of hilarity thrown in for good measure. If you've ever wanted to live out your wildest criminal fantasies without any real-life consequences, this game is your golden ticket. But beware, because chaos and comedy go hand in hand in Los Santos.  First off, let's talk about the characters. Michael, Trevor, and Franklin form a trio that's as dysfunctional as a broken joystick. Michael is the retired bank robber with family issues, Trevor is the psychopath with a twisted sense of humor, and Franklin is just trying to make a name for himself. Their interactions are like a never-ending episode of a crime-based sitcom, and their banter will have you laughing out loud between heists.  But it's not just the characters that bring the comedy gold. The open-world environment of Los Santos is an absolute playground for the mischievous. You can steal cars, run over pedestrians, cause massive explosions, and even go skydiving while dressed as a chicken. Yes, you read that right. The sheer absurdity of the side activities and random encounters is worth the price of admission alone.  And let's not forget about the radio stations. Whether you're cruising in a stolen sports car or evading the cops, the radio will never let you down. The satirical talk shows, ridiculous commercials, and catchy tunes make driving around the city an absolute joy. I've lost count of how many times I've found myself laughing hysterically at the witty commentary or dancing in my chair to some 80s power ballad while being chased by the police.  Of course, there's also the online mode, where you can team up with friends or complete strangers to cause even more chaos together. From crazy races where the laws of physics seem optional to heists that require a level of coordination that's equal parts hilarious and frustrating, it's a multiplayer experience unlike any other.  Now, it's important to mention that GTA 5 isn't just about the laughs. It also boasts a gripping story that delves into the dark underbelly of crime and greed. But let's be real, most of us are here for the wacky shenanigans and the joy of pushing the boundaries of what's possible within the game's virtual world.  In the end, GTA 5 is a game that doesn't take itself too seriously. It embraces the ridiculousness of its own existence and invites players to join in on the fun. If you're looking for a hilarious, action-packed adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end, grab your controller, buckle up, and get ready for a ride that's as crazy as it is unforgettable. Just remember, it's all fun and games until you accidentally run over a cow and end up with a five-star wanted level. Good luck, and enjoy the mayhem!",True

"I may be able to like the game if it worked. From the beginning the game has crashed at random times in different ways (from D3D errors to full computer crashes). I contacted RockStar support, after a couple days I got a canned response which did not help in any way. RockStar Supports website has an issue that does not allow dxdiag or msinfo to be uploaded, though they asked for it. Instead of replying and seeking a solution the best solution was found on the the internet, but it did not fix the issue entirely. RockStar Support has never replied to my open ticket though I have replaied every couple days. 8 days later, the game crashed and is now not loading the title screen at all.  In all the 17 hours I've played there have been a maybe 2 hours playtime before a crash.

"Probably one of the few people that bought this game over 7 times, though a few times it was as gifts for others. Anyway, is GTA 5 worth playing in 2023? Even more so with GTA 6 coming around the corner soon? Simple answer my friends: Yes.  ATM, I'd recommend getting the Series X/S versions or the PS5 versions as there's a few features that aren't currently on GTA Online for PC. That said, even having that, I'm still playing this on PC. GTA Online isn't what it was in 2013, and there's more than enough to do if you're wondering about that.  Strongly recommend playing with friends.",True

"Grand Theft Auto V, a game that has become a timeless classic, continues to captivate players with its enjoyable gameplay, multiplayer experience, and impressive graphics. As someone who has spent countless hours exploring the streets of Los Santos, I find myself drawn to the fun and immersive world that GTA V offers.  One of the standout aspects of GTA V is its multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online. The ability to join forces with friends and engage in various activities, from heists to races, adds an extra layer of excitement and camaraderie. The multiplayer component has undoubtedly contributed to the game's longevity and replayability.  Visually, GTA V impresses with its detailed and vibrant graphics. The sprawling city of Los Santos comes to life with its bustling streets, breathtaking landscapes, and meticulously designed environments. Rockstar Games' attention to detail is commendable, and it enhances the overall immersive experience of the game.  In terms of storytelling, GTA V initially stood out with its compelling narrative and memorable characters. The intertwining stories of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor offered a diverse perspective and added depth to the game. However, as time has passed, the storytelling has somewhat lost its impact, and it feels like the game could benefit from fresh ideas and a new installment.  Looking ahead, it's clear that the GTA franchise needs to evolve. While GTA V has undoubtedly been a monumental success, the anticipation for GTA 6 and the promise of new and exciting features is growing. Players are eager for Rockstar Games to introduce innovative gameplay mechanics, a captivating storyline, and even more immersive graphics in the next installment.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains an incredibly enjoyable game, particularly when played with friends and taking advantage of the vast multiplayer world. Its stunning graphics and initially compelling storytelling have left a lasting impression. However, as the franchise moves forward, the anticipation for GTA 6 and the hope for fresh experiences and advancements in the series continue to grow.",True

"I've been only playing the online and holy crap is a clusterduck in the worst sense, this game has been in service for over 10 years, I expected something good but instead you have an online where everyone has ducking cheat menus and who also everyone is just a wanabe buttface, there's ducking inflation in the economic system so you have to grind for days to buy a ducking vehicle, all ducking missions are unstable as ducking duck, the room either dies or the game crashes for some poor soul, you waste all your ducking day preparing some ducking heist which ends up loosing the fun since you've played it a millon duckig times already in the same ducking way, the other ways to get money is with business missions which is the most unfun thing I've ever played in my ducking life  This game is not even fun with friends, is just frustrating is annoying, if you think you deserve some kind of punishment in your life because it's not bad enough, then play the online mode of this ducking game, playing it is like working in a job you ducking hate but you don't want to leave because you got already used to it  I regret wasting my time with this ducking game holy ducking god  Don't make the same mistake as me  Duck...",False

"Main Game is worth the price , But multiplayer is not  Due to Decline in players making it impossible to earn cash unless you grind for months    Grand Theft Auto V Main Game:  Grand Theft Auto V, developed by Rockstar Games, is a masterfully crafted open-world action-adventure game that takes players on an unforgettable journey through the crime-ridden streets of Los Santos. Bursting with an immersive narrative, captivating characters, and a vast open world to explore, this game delivers an exceptional single-player experience that truly sets the bar high.  One of the standout features of Grand Theft Auto V is its engaging storyline. The game follows the lives of three distinct protagonists, each with their own quirks, motivations, and gripping story arcs. From the explosive heists to the personal struggles of the characters, the main game weaves a compelling narrative that keeps players hooked from start to finish. The attention to detail in both the dialogue and the environment is staggering, creating an incredibly realistic and immersive world.  The open-world setting of Los Santos is a remarkable feat of game design. From the bustling city streets to the vast countryside, the level of detail and variety is awe-inspiring. Whether you're exploring the urban sprawl or embarking on a scenic drive through the countryside, there's always something to discover or experience. The world feels alive, filled with countless activities, side missions, and secrets to uncover, making every playthrough a unique adventure.  The gameplay mechanics in Grand Theft Auto V are polished and satisfying. Whether you're engaging in intense gunfights, driving high-speed vehicles, or executing meticulously planned heists, the controls feel tight and responsive. The wide range of weapons, vehicles, and customization options further enhance the gameplay, allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferences.  Grand Theft Auto V Multiplayer:  While the main game of Grand Theft Auto V shines brightly, the multiplayer component, Grand Theft Auto Online, presents a more mixed experience. While it initially burst onto the scene with immense popularity, it's worth noting that the player count has been dwindling over time.  The multiplayer aspect of Grand Theft Auto V offers a sprawling open world that allows players to engage in various activities with others. From completing missions and heists together to participating in adrenaline-fueled races and competitive challenges, there is no shortage of content to enjoy. The ability to create and customize your own character also adds a personal touch to the experience.  However, the declining player count is an issue that can affect the overall enjoyment of the multiplayer aspect. Finding a full lobby or enough players to engage in certain activities can become increasingly challenging, especially as time goes on. This can result in occasional lulls in the gameplay experience and may limit the opportunities for dynamic interactions with other players.  In addition to the concerns about the dwindling player count in Grand Theft Auto Online, it's important to note that the multiplayer experience also faces criticism for its economy. The in-game currency, GTA$, is notoriously difficult to earn, particularly due to the declining player base. This can lead to frustrating and time-consuming grinding for players who wish to accumulate wealth and purchase desirable items within the game.  To mitigate this issue, Rockstar Games introduced microtransactions that allow players to purchase Shark Cards with real-world money, providing an influx of GTA$ to expedite progress. While this option can be appealing for those looking to bypass the lengthy grind, it has sparked debates about the game's reliance on real-world cash transfers to attain in-game wealth.  The heavy emphasis on microtransactions and the scarcity of in-game currency opportunities can create an imbalance between players who choose to invest real money and those who do not. This monetization strategy has garnered mixed reactions from the player community, with some feeling that it hampers the overall experience and favors players with deeper pockets.  It's important to mention that Grand Theft Auto Online does offer various ways to earn GTA$ through in-game activities, such as heists, missions, and races. However, the challenge of accumulating wealth can be a deterrent for players who seek a more balanced and accessible progression system.  While the multiplayer aspect's reliance on microtransactions and the difficulty in earning in-game currency can be a downside, it's worth noting that the core gameplay mechanics and activities within Grand Theft Auto Online still provide entertainment and opportunities for collaboration with other players.  Overall, the multiplayer component of Grand Theft Auto V, while facing issues of dwindling player count and a challenging economy, still offers engaging gameplay and a platform for cooperative experiences. However, the game would greatly benefit from finding a better balance between real-world cash transfers and in-game progression, ensuring a fair and enjoyable experience for all players, regardless of their financial investments.  Despite this issue, Grand Theft Auto Online still offers a wealth of content for those who can find active lobbies or play with friends. Additionally, Rockstar Games has been known to release regular updates and new content, keeping the multiplayer experience fresh and exciting.",False

Gotta be honest. This is the worst GTA story ever. Trevor is so one-note. Mike is a terrible satire of Tony Soprano. Franklin is the only character worth playing. How many times do we have to have a mission in the same construction site. Yes i know that was 10 years ago. GTA Online is like swatting flies away from a turd pile (the flies being cheaters/exploiters) (the turd being the experience as a whole) I refuse to do three hour prep for a heist that will barely pay for anything.,False
"alt tabbing during a loading screen takes breaks the game.  Edit loading screens take so long I got kicked for inactivity... IN A LOADING SCREEN. Rockstar games is worth Billions with a B. fix your game you've been milking for a fucking decade.  Edit: Can't do online heists because you need to own something first, whether that be a Hanger bunker or casino. Which cost millions each. But you can't do open world missions/events to earn money because someone who has done every heist and has hundreds of billions will pay to make themselves invisible on the mini map and drone strike you with a flying motor bike or A-10. and the counter to those is a missle launcher that costs $75,000. unless you grind the same mini games that pay $10K or the same DAX missions that pay 20K tops over and over and over until you can afford to buy the prerequisite to play the fucking game, or just pray a modder Tp's the entire lobby into a small area and drops money. Then you are doomed to being bullied by people with no option to fight back. Also 3 fucking minutes before you're kicked for inactivity?? I'm so sorry that I'm taking up valuable space on your servers rockstar games. Ik a small indie company like you is really struggling to keep the servers online.

"Circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle…  Three overhead signal sources, three characters where one is able to eclipse another, three mountains, three aligned beacons (fourth is inactive) and only two light sources that intersect one another. Only one time at a bird’s eye angle would one see a flipped side of a triangle. It’s all about taking a look.  Flipped everything would move differently as the days go by, at the second day, at the same time, it would be further than before. Two light sources are both aligned directly from whatever place you draw a line, as in order for one to move, both have to move together. When the dark light falls, the shape that ends at the right destination, this is when the signal is set to active. The signal would be circulating and vibrating differently as you enter a sound zone. Even then, it is hard to communicate. Light sources specifically are not important, what they do at the dotted space is. (Casting a light at an object that casts a dark light.)  An egg that looks like an eye has to rise and stay close at the right source of dark light. (Everything can cast a dark trail) It shouldn’t penetrate the circular hole, instead, it must wait. As one waits, another stands at the square of answers, while another follows a trail of dark light. Only when the air is white can the trail cast strongly and extremely visibly. Think of it as a black square.  And so it is kept. The light source moves accordingly and at a split time shall the signal come to be. (There is another light source where it only starts fading away.) An egg is stationary and it is so. The hole is also stationary and it is so. (Fading away light source is behind you, a light source that is always there emerges itself from the darkness that is light.) An egg shall stay near the hole and so a circle shall cast another circle (hole) right at a dotted space. Then shall you see and hear the answer you were looking for. With all the overhead sources the practice is the same, only one must be aroused near the hole and then, perhaps, it shall go through it.   A circle inside a circle inside a circle is only a circle inside a circle inside a circle where a circle inside a circle inside a circle actually looks to be a circle inside a circle inside a circle. It is a matter of perspective and where a circle inside a circle inside a circle actually is. Where you see a circle inside a circle inside a circle is also important, as largest circle may move and you will miss a time window. When everything is done, when a signal from the hole with an egg near it comes through, at the end shall a harmonic circle where everybody stays appear and cast a relaxing light of pleasure at a plug. A plug is sharp, a plug is the top of a blocky object at the middle. A large hole shall sit down on a plug and lazer beam a big ball and it shall crack. Crawl inside and see the truth. One large ball split in half is actually an entrance. Get in, climb on in. Inside a light of gold everywhere, a majestic light of high performance intensity and at the very middle… Another egg. A big chocolate egg you can eat forever. You can lick an egg with your tongue. You are free to do it slowly, an egg is looked after, it won’t melt. Do it slowly for intense, but prolonged pleasure. Pull out your tongue hard and start sucking. An egg is tasty but…  What about Grand Theft Auto V? Have I liked the game? No. I haven’t either enjoyed or liked the game.",True

I stopped playing for about a year and came back to enjoy the game. Rockstar social club launches and it gives me an error saying the email can't be logged in automatically. I look and the email that I have to use that is connected to the account isn't my email and it's connected to my steam so I can't use another email or even another account. I go to rockstar support and it asks me for information that I don't have access to such as usernames so now I can't play the game. I try playing offline but the game launches then closes even when I set it to story mode only. What a dogshit system.,False

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA 5) is a game that's like attending a wedding where everyone's drunk, there's a llama in the punch bowl, and the bride just stole a helicopter. And somehow, that's what makes it absolutely glorious.  In the wide, sun-drenched, bullet-riddled world of Los Santos, you'll experience life as a retired criminal trying to enjoy his golden years. Too bad these golden years involve more high-speed chases, explosions, and questionable life choices than an action movie marathon.  At its core, GTA 5 is about freedom. The freedom to drive like a maniac, to spend your hard-earned (or stolen) cash on military-grade firepower, to run a multi-million dollar criminal enterprise. And let's not forget the freedom to parachute from a plane in a chicken suit, because why not?  Playing as Michael feels like starring in your own reality TV show where you're constantly one step away from a mental breakdown. As Franklin, you're hustling and grinding your way to the top, all while dealing with the most comically dysfunctional friends imaginable. And then there's Trevor... sweet, psychotic Trevor. Spending a day in his shoes is akin to attending a non-stop adrenaline-fueled party at a madhouse.  Despite its age, GTA 5 is still a riotous romp that refuses to age gracefully. It's the party animal who's still chugging shots while everyone else has long since passed out. The graphics still hold up, the soundtrack is eclectic, and the city of Los Santos is as lively and unpredictable as ever.  Is it perfect? Nope. You'll probably end up hammering your keyboard at least once when you fail a mission because you accidentally ran over a pedestrian, got a wanted level, and then were promptly obliterated by the police. But that's all part of the chaotic charm.  n conclusion, if you've ever wanted to experience the thrill of a high-speed police chase from the comfort of your own home, GTA 5 is the game for you. Just remember: in Los Santos, the only rules are the ones you break. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to head back into the game. My pet mountain lion, Mr. Fluffy, gets antsy if I leave him in the car too long. And trust me, you haven't seen chaos until you've seen a bored mountain lion in a virtual city.",True

Modders can mess with you in many ways - force you out of your apartment, bunker, nightclub etc to take out everyone in the session.

Overall, I love GTA Online and I've had a lot of fun with it, but the hacker issue is slowly but surely ruining the experience.",True

Always enjoyed this game from the time it released (originally played on Xbox 360) and continued on Xbox One. Just got it for PC a few weeks ago and put in a bunch of hours already.   Works fantastic on PC aside from a few glitches here and there. The draw distance is the best it's been so far on the three consoles I played it on. I especially love that you can do any type of job now on an invite only so I'm not constantly plagued by griefers (which was a problem for almost 9 years).  9/10,True

"This game is one of the greatest masterpieces of our generation. It has complex rpg and teamwork elements, and a captivating and emotional story. The pacing is perfect and there are just enough plot twists to make each one feel meaningful. Furthermore, the puzzles are amazing and scale perfectly. Each one gets you thinking but none are ever so difficult that you have to look it up. Its graphics are stunning and are truly a next gen experience. Even with the amazing graphics it still runs well on almost all computers with high fps.This is the best game to ever come out on steam, and possibly the best video game that has ever been released.",True

Want to call your car in? Nahhhh we'll break it this update. Wanna enter buildings? Nahhh we'll break that too. Loadings times are still god fking awful, big game or not, I shouldn't have a 9 out of 10 chance to get an infinite loading screen. There are 32 players in every lobby and 16 of them are guaranteed to have Hacks/Mods and no anti-cheat to combat it. We also decided to remove half the content of the game for God knows what reason and it didn't help anything at all. The real question is what baboon did Rockstar hand an IPad to that points at the next dumb idea on it and Rockstar goes *Sure, let's implement that.* ffs do not spend money on this game ever.",False

"Grand Theft Auto V is an extraordinary video game that has truly pushed the boundaries of open-world gaming, delivering an unparalleled experience of crime, chaos, and adventure. Developed by Rockstar Games, this masterpiece has captivated millions of players worldwide, including myself, with its stunning visuals, immersive gameplay, and an intricately woven storyline.  From the moment you step foot into the sprawling metropolis of Los Santos, you are instantly transported into a living, breathing world that feels incredibly authentic. The attention to detail is unparalleled, with meticulously designed landscapes, bustling city streets, and a diverse cast of characters that make the game's universe feel vibrant and alive.  One of the standout features of Grand Theft Auto V is its three playable protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking redemption, Franklin, a street-smart hustler looking for a way out of his dead-end life, and Trevor, a volatile psychopath with a penchant for chaos. Each character brings a unique perspective to the game, and their intertwined narratives create a compelling and engaging storyline that keeps you hooked from start to finish.  The gameplay mechanics in GTA V are exceptional, offering a seamless blend of driving, shooting, and exploration. Whether you're engaging in high-speed pursuits, engaging in thrilling heists, or simply wandering the streets causing mayhem, the controls are intuitive and responsive, providing a satisfying sense of control. The ability to switch between characters at any time adds a layer of depth and strategic planning, allowing you to approach missions from different angles.  One cannot discuss Grand Theft Auto V without mentioning its online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online. It is a living, ever-evolving world where players can create their own criminal empire, team up with friends, participate in thrilling missions, and compete in a wide range of activities. The sheer scope of content and the constant updates and additions by Rockstar Games ensure that there is always something new to explore and experience.  Furthermore, the game's soundtrack deserves special praise. From the catchy radio tunes to the atmospheric ambient scores, the music in GTA V perfectly complements the gameplay and helps create an immersive experience.  In terms of graphics, Grand Theft Auto V is a visual marvel. The attention to detail is astonishing, with stunning landscapes, realistic character models, and breathtaking weather effects. The game's ability to maintain a high level of visual fidelity while delivering a vast open world is a testament to the technical prowess of the developers.  Grand Theft Auto V is not without its controversies, as its mature themes and depiction of violence may not be suitable for all players. However, it remains a landmark achievement in the world of gaming, pushing boundaries, and setting new standards for open-world experiences.",True

"Rating: 5/5 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟  Holy guacamole, folks! GTA 5 is an absolute blast and a crime wave of epic proportions. I've never had so much fun breaking the law without facing the consequences... in a video game, of course!  From the moment I fired up the game, I was thrown into a massive sandbox of mischief, complete with a gazillion opportunities to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting citizens of Los Santos. Seriously, it's like the city has an unlimited supply of stolen vehicles, and I'm the Robin Hood of joyriding!  The storyline is wilder than a rodeo on caffeine. I found myself rooting for the three protagonists, Michael, Trevor, and Franklin, even though they're as nutty as a fruitcake. The banter between them had me laughing harder than a hyena on laughing gas. These guys know how to deliver some seriously hilarious dialogue while blowing stuff up!  Speaking of blowing stuff up, the sheer amount of chaos you can unleash in this game is mind-blowing. Need a break from stealing cars? How about skydiving off Mount Chiliad and crashing into a swimming pool? Or maybe you're in the mood to rampage through the city with a rocket launcher, turning everything into a fiery mess? The possibilities are as endless as my cackling laughter while causing mayhem!  And let's not forget about GTA Online, where the real party is at. It's like a never-ending carnival of insanity, with players from all over the world teaming up to pull off heists, race cars, or simply engage in a friendly brawl on the streets. Trust me, the chaos multiplier increases exponentially when you add other players into the mix. It's like a symphony of virtual pandemonium!  Visually, GTA 5 is a stunner. The graphics are so jaw-droppingly gorgeous that I found myself stopping mid-crime spree just to admire the sunsets, the stunning cityscapes, and the mesmerizing details. It's like stepping into a virtual postcard... if that postcard also happened to include explosions and a guy in a chicken suit robbing a convenience store.  All in all, GTA 5 is an absolute gem of a game. It's like a never-ending comedy show with explosions, car chases, and a whole lot of laughs. If you're in the mood for some hilarious, over-the-top action, buckle up and dive into the chaos. Just remember, it's all in good fun, folks. Leave the real-life crime to the fictional pixels!  Disclaimer: No virtual citizens were harmed during my gameplay sessions. Well, maybe a few hundred, but who's counting? It's all part of the fun, right?",True

"This game sucks, online is constantly patrolled by griefers driving opressor mark twos and deluxos, Rockstar released new content but only for the latest consoles (no pc) and on top of that deleted almost 200 CARS FROM THE IN GAME WEBSITE. Online without a private server is infuriating because you cant go 10 feet without getting blown up. After you beat story mode there is barely anything to do because Rockstar made it so tons of businesses, missions and vehicles are only in online. The only way to get these in story mode is installing mods. Even mods have their problems though. They are a lot harder to install then regular mods because GTA 5 doesn't have a steam workshop, SO EVERY TIME YOU ADD A MOD IT CORRUPTS THE ENTIRE GAME, but then it also starts CRASHING!!!! Regular GTA 5 crashed once every hour for me. I got some mods and then it starts crashing ONCE EVERY 5 MINUTES. It is basically unplayable considering it takes 10 MINUTES TO LOAD BACK IN. The only way I could fix the crashing is to UPGRADE MY RAM TO 32 GIGS TO MAKE A GAME PLAYABLE. This game is garbage and you have two options to play the game after you beat the mediocre story, play online and grind for hours only to get blown up by opressor mark twos, or spend hours manually installing mods only to have the game corrupt and for your hours of hard work to be deleted. I absolutely fucking hate this game, it's shitty online and the lack of a steam workshop.  Update : It got even worse, now I can't even play story mode. I tried it without  mods and with mods and both of them gave me this activation error. I've reinstalled the game multiple times but nothing works, spending hard earned money for a game that doesn't work is crazy.",False

How do you summarise the game that literally defined gaming for the last decade? GTAV Broke ground in every area of gaming and is more than just entertainment it's art. from the almost life like at times graphics to the crazy NPCs. Grand Theft Auto is so unique because it lets people become someone else fro a moment and do something that they wouldn't do in real life. It's a cathartic experience.

GTA V is one of my favorite game stories of all time and online still continues to impress me with new innovations and additions still presently being introduced with fun, well imagined stories and adventures. Nothing compares to the jelly-like driving in this game. GTA V Online is not for the faint of heart and has become a much more expansive place then when I began playing online shortly after game release. There has always been an issue with ""modders/hackers/trolls"" online and despite some friendly players every now and then, the amount of trolling and disrespectful gamers can make the game... well lets not throw a controller. Like I said, this game is not for the faint of heart but if you can hang you are going to have a great trip. I look forward to GTA VI.",True

"I am an old player. I have an account where I grinded countless hours. Not only does my account not transfer, but I was banned on my new account after only one month of playing this game. I got 221 hours in this game total.  I was banned because I got tired of the countless times I was killed, often by players with a mod menu. I downloaded a mod menu, not to hurt people, but to protect myself. People were booting me from sessions, locking me in boxes, shooting fireworks out of their you know what, among many other things. I spent a hundred dollars on this game and instead of getting a warning or anything like that, I was straight suspended for 2 months. I played this game before and I even put money into it, even though my friends said it was a waste. You guys have a cash cow, a money pit, and you have a fraudulent way to run your servers. I get not wanting modders and stuff but I didn't hurt anyone. I get taking the stuff away and a ban for a day or two, but no, no warning no nothing. Like I said, I put $100 into this game, and now I can't even get online. Not that I want to join the toxic free roam where players have all the cool shit, and I can't access my account on PC. My account is on Xbox, but I'm switching to PC. Does Rockstar understand? No. Do they care? No. I'll tell you what. I'm never playing your stupid game again, and I won't be buying GTA6 if you ever come out with that, and I'm going to let everyone I know to never play it or get the new one either. I hope your corrupt company goes out of business, and I'll be sure to report your business for your fraudulent play. You guys do this all the time. I've seen it on Xbox and it's no way to run a business. You can't control the hackers, so you make everyone scared and then unsuspecting players like me are stuck after spending our hard earned money with a ban for protecting ourselves from the hackers you can't control. Your company is a joke and I hope people wake up to the garbage this game is. Don't think you're going to get away with my hundred bucks either.",False

"i'm a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was, already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son so many happy memories",True

"Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)  Oh boy, where do I even begin with Grand Theft Auto (GTA)? This game is like a rollercoaster ride on steroids with a side of extra cheese! If you're looking for a gaming experience that is absolutely bonkers, then strap in and get ready for a wild and wacky adventure.  First things first, the open-world in GTA is mind-blowing. You've got an entire city at your fingertips, just waiting to be explored and wreak havoc upon. Whether you want to take a leisurely drive through the streets, jump off a skyscraper, or cause chaos with rocket launchers and tanks, the possibilities are endless. And hey, if you ever get tired of the main storyline, you can always hop on a bicycle and chase down some unsuspecting pedestrians for a good laugh.  Let's talk about the characters, shall we? Rockstar Games has a knack for creating some of the most memorable and downright outrageous characters in gaming history. From the eccentric Trevor with his unpredictable behavior to the suave and smooth-talking Michael, you'll find yourself laughing at their antics and wondering how on earth they manage to stay alive with all the shenanigans they get into.  One of the best things about GTA is the humor. The game doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's what makes it so entertaining. You'll encounter radio stations with hilarious talk shows, outrageous commercials, and even the occasional celebrity cameo. The satire and social commentary sprinkled throughout the game will have you chuckling and shaking your head in equal measure.  Now, let's address the elephant in the room: the mayhem. GTA is all about embracing your inner chaos agent. You can steal cars, rob banks, cause massive explosions, and go on rampages that would make Godzilla proud. Just remember, it's all in the name of good, silly fun. I mean, where else can you fly a helicopter while dressed as a chicken, shooting rockets at your enemies? Only in GTA, my friend.  In terms of technical aspects, GTA on Steam runs like a well-oiled machine. The graphics are top-notch, the controls are smooth, and the attention to detail is impressive. The developers have put in a lot of effort to create a living, breathing world that feels alive and vibrant.  However, I have to deduct one star because, let's face it, GTA isn't exactly known for its realism. Sometimes the missions can get a bit repetitive, and the AI can be a little wonky. But hey, who needs realism when you can hijack a fighter jet and do loop-de-loops in the sky?  All in all, if you're looking for a game that will make you laugh, gasp, and question your sanity, then Grand Theft Auto on Steam is the perfect choice. It's a wild and wacky adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end. Just be prepared to embrace the madness and leave your serious pants at the door. Enjoy the chaos, my fellow gamers!",True

WAY too many hackers. Like every single server online is FILLED with hackers. Also has major connections issues.

"If you want to get this to play the single player mode, it's worth it. If you want to play online, DO NOT PURCHASE. Lobbies are FULL of hackers. Instead of fixing this issue, rockstar decided to enable people to play GTA ONLINE ALONE IN AN INVITE ONLY SESSION. You are forced to play this online multiplayer game alone, in a private lobby, unless you want to constantly get griefed by people flying through the air in vehicles that will blow you up in one shot. This game used to be fun, but now every aspect of the game has been finely tuned by rockstar to entice you into spending real money on shark cards. They removed content from pc players and then put it behind a pay wall THAT WE DONT EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO. PC is not anywhere near the front of their minds as they get ready to put out GTA 6. its been a year and a half since they added awesome new cars that go 30-60 mph faster than any car on pc, and yet we still arent allowed to use any of them. we all hoped that after a year, they would release it to the pc crowd, but instead of giving us these faster cars, THEY TOOK NEARLY 200 CARS AWAY FROM US. all new content is just reused assets from single player missions, they constantly reduce the earning potential from businesses, unless one is part of a double money event, and even then, those businesses are not as good at making you money as the cayo perico heist, which they put a massive cooldown on. overall, it can be a fun game and i loved it. really loved it. but the blatant lack of care for the pc community is downright infuriating week after week, month after month of being forgotten. not worth it on PC.  unless you're going to hack/mod in the online. in which case, congratulations, you are now part of the problem. the only way to have fun on this game is to either try to have fun grinding boring repetitive missions over and over again just to purchase an overpriced, underperforming car. any car that was reasonably priced for its performance was REMOVED FROM THE DAMN GAME.  pathetic support for an extremely large community. again, i used to love this game but it feels like having a girlfriend who goes out every weekend and cheats on you and then comes home expecting you to take her out on a date. dont let rockstar c*ck you. if you want to play it that badly just wait for gta 6 or be prepared to be bitterly disappointed after a few hours, once you realize how long itll take to get something that doesn't really enhance the gameplay experience. Or just do what rockstar really wants you to do. not enjoy the game. but spend more money on it in the hopes that you might actually eventually enjoy it.",False

This is the most important review I have ever written.  Please read and listen close  YES this is a game YES I understand this is roleplay YES I know most normal people will not be affected by this in their real life but unstable people are not and love this  tell you about me.  I work for the police RL.  I was very late to try this game bc I thought it was misguided... thought it was not  a good influence  finally I think maybe it would be fun so I bought it  opening scene I had to kill about 20 cops just to take money from a bank they had families sons and daughters wives they are trying to keep you safe!  money that does not belong to them I feel the adrenaline rush it is seductive but you ruin families... children left without a father and wives without a husband to be honest I started to feel the rush wanted to kill just to get out  THAT IS THE END OF CIVILIZATION I truly believe as a gamer THIS game makes killers in real life make people want to murder their schoolmates  this game is trash and ruins our lives...   back in the days of DOOM many journalists argued that violence is supported by video games I thought it was nonsense I play video games too :) but always against an evil force something trying to destroy humanity  THIS game trys to destroy humanity and I think it is working look at all the deaths IRL in America... random shootings  As I played I got angry at cops for stopping me and that is horrible this BREEDS discontent and desire to steal money save our future don't love this game  please do not appreciate this game,False
its an OG game and everyone should experience the masterpiece.,True
"A Game that I would happily purchase on every platform available and spend time with my friends to always kill some time.  It has always received constant updates with regards to graphics, game modes, vehicles, events, missions, customisation, apartments, activities and more.  I will briefly say that the main story line is an experience one must play more than once, it is unforgettable and action-packed with a lot of exciting moments and many interesting ways to play around the world and how it'll be affected.  But the main focus is the multi-player, it is without a doubt a true experience that MUST be enjoyed with friends as it brings about the true possibilities this game can provide which consist of Heists, Death matches, Races, Casinos, Water Activities, Illegal Business, Hitmen and more.  There will always be a memorable moment for everyone, from struggling to perfect a Heist without any deaths, to the joys of travelling in Custom Sport Cars whilst listening to the Radio which constantly get updated and play a mix of classic songs and modern rap whenever you choose.  9/10 - I wish I have a chance to experience the game for the first time again.",True

"The game as a whole is awesome whether you're a solo player or you've a group of friends. I mean it's GTA. The only thing that I had about is this game are some of the bugs & glitches. Like if you get in a heist or a job with your friends. Once, its over. You would either be staring into a black or white screen forever and sometimes it works but when it does. It sends you and your friends to different closed sessions. They've a quick join feature in your in-game phone which allows you to get into different sort of jobs quicker. Howver in various modes it doesn't work like the cayo perico heist, doomsday heist, diamond casino heist, etc. you might get into the lobby sometimes but after that it automatically kicks you or ends the job. Now there are various other problems but these ones are the ones that many people go through and the major ones. Minor ones are like sometimes if some ends a job while you're in the lobby. You teleport under the building or in the  apartment with no way to get out so you've to kys in order to get out but these minor problems doesn't matter at all. PLEASE try to fix the major ones....

But you can even play with other characters who you know (you can play with your friends who can make their own characters as well. If it isn't tooooo expensive like when I got it, relatively speaking, then sure, I don't think it'll be so bad to give old screecher a whirl. And what I mean is that this whole game is 100 GB. It's so expensive to the storage space. And even because is computer is not soooooooo good it kind of acts slow, really if I'm honest. I would love to go inside more the buildings though. If that can happen in the next version of the game, I would be grateful. Otherwise, save for the ugly, slow, and stupid qualities this game clings to, I'm truthfully having a blast.

Pay to win. Boring. Grindy. Pathetic. The fact that the game is not only not free but also has a membership is unhinged. This game has nothing going for it. It is also filled with modders but won't let me play the game bc I changed a file so I could play all activities in a private session. It's actually disgusting that the game forces you to play certain activities in public lobbies. That will just result in flying motorcycles bombing you and stealing your shipment.

So this fun gta game is great! you can even download fiveM and do some realistic online game plays through your GTA v game! and in the game its self they have system set up where people who cause chaos get stuck in server after a while with others who cause much chaos too! BUNCH of bonuses through out the past 2 years! from BIG event and fun ones one time they had ecola vs spunk! I TRIED MY BEST TO MAKE SPUNK SODA WIN! but more cokecol.. i mean ecola fans out there :3 UMM the game it self also add community maps at times for there 3X events 24/7 there will be a 2X or 3X event missions you can find on menu of game.driving is cool cause after a while you can remember which cars drive better on different terrains realistic..? IDK cars sorry but i know more about GTA cars than real life cars cause of this game lol. looking to make quick cash on game all you gotta do is wait for them 3X events and play them alot and boom! easy 3-4 million in one day from that. WAs able to buy krieger for first car in game and it cost 3.5 million in game due to the 3X events! tons of outfit options and seems like they gonna keep adding stuff till GTA 6. I HOPE they keep the #X events and community maps adding for events to game after they make GTA 6 but if they dont i hope they make GTA 6 just as fun as GTA 5 good multiplayer coop and vs and epic story THANKS ROCKSTAR STAY AWESOME I AM GLAD WE HAD THE CHANCE TO PLAY THESE CRAZY GRAND THRIFT AUTO GAMES IN OUR LIFE!

"It's hard to recommend a game that puts their content and supposed ""unused vehicles"" (which are still very popular) behind a pay wall. Rockstar is just showing their true colours and want to monetize everything, Next thing you know they will add loot boxes and micro transactions (Oh wait they already did).  The only good thing about the game is LSPDFR, for others the PvP was okay (or so I've heard) but I personally never liked the whole encouraging griefing thing nor the micro-transactions nor the encouragement of kids playing a MATURE game when they can't even comprehend common sense. They NEED to leave Fortnite alone where it is because true gamers do not like that crap or griefing for no damn reason.  Rockstar is shying away from it's true fan base that has been there since the beginning to trade it for a quick buck from kids that just want shiny things and ignorant parents that let them get it without checking or just don't care. So far just about every major company in the industry is only out to make a quick dollar and not staying true to their core values and it is just sickening. DLC's were enough and the only way to stop this is for the gaming community to put our foot down and stop this in it's tracks before it gets exponentially worse.",False

"[h1]GTA V (STEAM EDITION)[/h1]  This review is from someone who's never played GTA before so just so you know. Ngl the gameplay is great and the whole way the game and story is structured is really good. Story is great and in general a great game. Cars are rip-offs from real ones (Karin Calico = Toyota Celica (1990s) etc) but they're still epic. You can do a lot in terms of customisation of cars in both Story Mode and Online. One main problem for me is the hackers on GTA online. A while back I crashed into another car in online by accident and this guy comes out throwing whatever at me, before I know it I'm GTA online level 106 and have found all collectables or whatever they're called. Also the 106GB storage needed is a bit big for a lot of people, pretty sure it's mainly for the map for non-online play, not sure but it is big.

"Grand Theft Auto 5 delivers an exhilarating experience with its enjoyable costume customization and a wide variety of cars to choose from, allowing players to fully immerse themselves in their chosen roles and missions. The game's interactive multiplayer aspect adds an extra layer of excitement and engagement. While the graphics are visually appealing, especially with an upgraded VGA, the passage of time has made it evident that newer titles like Red Dead Online have surpassed GTA 5 in terms of visual presentation. Nonetheless, the game's captivating storyline, a trademark of Rockstar, leaves a lasting impact, particularly the memorable decision of choosing which character receives the final shot after spending the entire game with two companions. Overall, Grand Theft Auto 5 stands as an excellent game, but fans eagerly await the arrival of a new installment in the series, perhaps in the form of GTA 6.",True

"I have recently had the pleasure of diving into the world of Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA 5) and its online counterpart, and I must say it has been an absolutely fantastic experience. Rockstar Games has truly created a masterpiece that captivates players with its immersive gameplay, stunning visuals, and an expansive open world that offers endless opportunities for excitement and exploration.  One of the standout features of GTA 5 is its compelling storyline. The game introduces us to three unique protagonists, each with their own compelling backstories and personalities. The writing and voice acting are top-notch, drawing players into a gritty and often humorous narrative filled with unexpected twists and turns. The character development is superb, making it easy to form a strong connection with these virtual personas.  The open world of Los Santos is an absolute marvel. The attention to detail is astounding, from the bustling streets to the towering skyscrapers and lush countryside. Whether I'm cruising through the city in a flashy sports car or embarking on an adrenaline-pumping heist, the level of immersion is unparalleled. The world feels alive, with pedestrians going about their daily lives, emergency services responding to incidents, and a wide array of activities to engage in, such as tennis, golf, and even skydiving.  GTA Online takes the already outstanding single-player experience and expands it into a multiplayer realm. It provides a vast and dynamic playground for players to team up or compete against each other in a variety of game modes and activities. Whether I'm participating in adrenaline-fueled races, engaging in intense heists with friends, or simply exploring the open world together, the multiplayer aspect adds a whole new dimension of fun and excitement.  Rockstar Games has done an excellent job of supporting GTA Online with regular updates and new content, ensuring that the experience remains fresh and engaging. They consistently introduce new missions, vehicles, and game modes, keeping players hooked and invested in the online world. The ability to customize and personalize my character and own luxury properties provides a sense of progression and achievement, further enhancing the long-term appeal of the game.  Furthermore, the community surrounding GTA 5 and Online is incredibly vibrant and diverse. Interacting with other players from around the world adds an unpredictable and dynamic element to the gameplay. Whether it's teaming up for cooperative missions or engaging in heated battles in the competitive modes, the multiplayer aspect fosters a sense of camaraderie and friendly competition.  In conclusion, GTA 5 and its online counterpart provide an unparalleled gaming experience. The captivating storyline, immersive open world, and the dynamic multiplayer component make it a true masterpiece. Rockstar Games has created a virtual world that offers endless hours of entertainment, and their commitment to ongoing updates and content ensures that players are continually engaged.

"The driving in the game is therapeutic.  One of the best things about GTA V Online is the variety of cars and vehicles you can drive, especially the ones that can fly. Yes, you heard me right, there are some cars and bikes that can take off and soar through the air like a bird or a plane. Imagine the fun you can have with your friends, cruising around the city, dodging bullets and missiles, and laughing at the poor souls stuck on the ground. Here are some of the coolest flying vehicles you can get in GTA V Online:  Imponte Deluxo: This is a classic sports car that looks like it came straight out of a sci-fi movie. It has gull-wing doors, a sleek design, and a hidden feature: it can fly. At the click of a button, you can switch between car mode and hover/fly mode, and glide over any obstacle in your way. You can also equip it with weapons such as a machine gun and homing missiles, making it a deadly aerial threat. The Deluxo can be purchased from Warstock Cache & Carry for $5,750,0001. Pegassi Oppressor: This is a motorcycle that has wings and a rocket boost. It can jump and glide for a limited amount of time, or use the boost to fly faster and higher. It can also be fitted with weapons such as a machine gun and homing missiles, making it a versatile vehicle for both land and air combat. The Oppressor can be purchased from Warstock Cache & Carry for $2,750,0001. Pegassi Oppressor Mk II: This is an upgraded version of the Oppressor, that replaces the wheels with the ability to hover and fly. It’s faster, more agile, and more stable than its predecessor, and can also be fitted with weapons such as homing missiles and countermeasures. The Oppressor Mk II can be purchased from Warstock Cache & Carry for $8,000,0001. Mammoth Thruster (Jetpack): This is a jetpack that lets you fly like a superhero. It has two thrusters on the sides that propel you forward and upward, and two smaller ones on the back that help you steer. It can also be fitted with weapons such as homing missiles, making it a fun and powerful gadget to use. The Thruster (Jetpack) can be purchased from Warstock Cache & Carry for $2,500,0001.  These are just some of the flying vehicles you can get in GTA V Online. There are also planes, helicopters, blimps, and more that you can use to explore the sky. You can also do various activities with your friends in GTA V Online, such as races, deathmatches, heists, missions, freemode events, business battles, drug wars2, and more. GTA V Online is a game that never gets boring, because there’s always something new and exciting to do with your friends.",True

Now I'm down the middle with this game, I do recommend it for the singleplayer experience and the top shelf story telling by R* but can not recommend it for the online side, too much greed with the shark cards, too many cheaters and hackers from what I've heard and just general BS from T2/R* about things through the years.",True

"Steam says I have 352 hours on GTAV/GTAO. Considering I ported my character over from Xbox 360, it should be at least double that.   So lets say 112 hours.  I have spent aproximately 112 hours playing this video game.  Yet I cannot recommend it.  Yes I have had some of the best gaming I've ever had with this game. I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign, I played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside. I even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card. I was there for the DNS glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur, and I was there when they cut literally everyone's funds to 500,000 as a ""fix""  But one day I was playing and some guy joins the server, forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him, freezes us, and makes bags of money rain from the sky.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not stupid, I know people hack and people give out money. I've seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc. I've generally ignored them, but this guy didn't give me much of a choice.  Regardless once I figured out what was happening I left the server. I didn't want the money in my bank so I blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up.  A couple hours later I was temporarily banned and my character was reset. I lost all of my cars, including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched, not to mention the majority of that 112 hours I'd put into having a character I liked.  Rockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me. My ingame wallet was raped and they decided to blame the victim.  There was no way for me to voice my displeasure to Rockstar. No appeals process for them to hear my case, check the evidence, and see my innocence.  That was several months ago. I uninstalled the game and let it go.  I'm only writing this now so that others can see what they're getting into.  Yes, as I've said, this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content. From an objective standpoint, its very good value for money and the free, regular, DLC is a nice touch.  What ruins all of that is the way Rockstar treats its customers. There's no consistency, and no compassion. I know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and they've never had any trouble. Yet it happens to me once, without my consent, and I get temp banned and lose literally everything.  What motivation is there to play legitimately then? If people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision, and those who don't can get away with it indefinitely.  Hell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience.  Rockstar, if you actually end up reading this, please start treating your customers with some compassion. Don't assume we're all hackers.",True

"Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best thrilling open-world action-adventure game that I've played till date. It combines a gripping narrative with immersive gameplay. Set in the fictional city of Los Santos, it follows three protagonists—Michael, Franklin, and Trevor—each with a unique story. The game excels in its realistic graphics, diverse missions, and an expansive open-world environment. With engaging heists, dynamic characters, and a plethora of activities, GTA V offers an unparalleled gaming experience. Whether cruising through the city, participating in high-stakes robberies, or exploring the vast landscape, the game captivates players with its depth and attention to detail. A modern classic that continues to captivate audiences till date despite being released such a long time ago.",True
"The campaign is fantastic and immersive, so go play it if you haven't. However,  There are too many modders in GTA Online, I encounter at least one each session. They have the powers to completely break your online experience. If you do anything to annoy them perhaps accidentally, they have the power to remove you from the session. For a company like Rockstar, this is unacceptable.",True

"I did not enjoy Grand Theft Auto V.  Played for 45 hours, reached 25% completion. For me, this was simply hard work.  The graphics quality is amazing if compared with GTA San-Andreas. The depth of all the crazy characters and the scope of the map is epic. (Seems good so far?!?)  But the game-play in each ""mission"" is mundane silly shooting or driving or pointing things at other things. And the complexity of the controls ... (I am using an Xbox360 controller with the game running on a Windows PC) ... are completely confusing, overwhelming, and the functions of buttons and sticks keeps changing in bizarre ways when you move from being on foot to driving to flying, and all sorts of other special activities.  In summary, I don't think this is really a ""game"". It is more like watching a mashup of Adventure Films, TV soap operas, Soft Porn, Reality TV programs, and Art movies - but, instead of simply watching the films, the""player"" is constantly being told to press some buttons and tilt some joystics in a rather moronic fashion.  I found it very difficult to find the right buttons or joysticks or D-pad controls in each situation, and to read the instructions popping up on screen and then vanishing, and to control the gun / camera / car / etc with the required accuracy and speed, And all for what purpose? Just so the plot of the GTA V ""film"" (that is called ""Story Mode"" in GTA V) can proceed. No thank-you.  There are so many controls, and so many overlapping control actions, that some of the actions involve holding certain buttons whilst pressing other buttons in a strictly timed sequence. If you do the button convolutions wrong in sequence or in timing then it just does something different - not what is needed. Near impossible for me to sort all that out when in the heat of battle against opposing ground and air forces - and needing to switch between three different player characters - all in the same helicopter!  Go to ""Ammunation"" gun ranges to practise shooting? No good. The shooting controls are different when in the gun range from those in the real world. I could not pass the first round of anything in the gun ranges.  The only player-controlled activity that I enjoyed in this game was to take a cross-country motorbike ride out over the hills to the coast, and take a swim in the ocean. For that activity there are simple controls, great graphics, and all at the player's own choice and control. But that activity is nothing to do with the ""missions"" of the game.  After playing for three weeks I uninstalled the game. I am glad I saw the graphics on a 2K PC monitor. Apart from that one pleasure I regard the experience as a waste of my money and a waste of my time.",False

"Oh boy, where do I even begin with GTA V? It's like strapping yourself into a rocket-powered roller coaster that takes you on a thrill ride you never wanted to end! Here's my hilariously chaotic review of this insane game:  First off, let's talk about the story. It's like a crazy mashup of a Hollywood blockbuster, a soap opera, and a fever dream. You've got three protagonists: Michael, the retired bank robber who can't resist one last score; Franklin, the street-smart hustler with dreams of making it big; and Trevor, the absolute madman who's so unpredictable, you'll question your own sanity just by being in the same virtual universe as him. These characters are so outlandishly entertaining that you'll find yourself cheering for the bad guys and laughing maniacally at their ridiculous antics.The world of Los Santos is a sprawling playground of mayhem and debauchery. Want to go skydiving? Sure, why not! Feel like taking a leisurely drive through the city? Good luck avoiding the inevitable car crash or pedestrian pile-up because, let's be honest, following traffic rules is for boring people. And don't even get me started on the police chases. Nothing beats stealing a cop car, causing utter chaos, and then escaping by the skin of your teeth, all while laughing manically at the sheer absurdity of it all.",True

"As an open action adventure game in a virtual world, GTA 5 is undoubtedly a very good game.  It offers a huge game world with a rich variety of missions and activities, full of excitement and challenges.   First of all, the game screen of GTA 5 is very exquisite, and the details are handled very well.  Whether it is city buildings, vehicle models or character movements, it all gives people a realistic feeling.  At the same time, the sound effects and soundtrack of the game are also very good, which can enhance the atmosphere and immersion of the game.   Secondly, the plot of GTA 5 is very exciting, full of suspense, excitement and surprises.  Players can play different roles and experience different story lines, which makes the game more attractive and deep.   In addition, GTA 5 also provides a variety of game content and activities.  Players can freely explore the game world, drive various vehicles, participate in various tasks and challenges, and can also play online multiplayer games with other players.

"The story mode is a blast. With online unless you have friends you have to do heists with randoms and you always get stuck with some idiot that screws up the heist or leaves midway through. The updates have been sucking the past year with the most recent one removing more content than it adds. Furthermore, if you want any of the cool cars the game has to offer you either have to use mods or make grinding the aforementioned heists a second job. Buy it on sale for the story mode and maybe have some fun with friends online. Also never buy Shark Cards, they completely ruined online.",True

"I have owned this game since October of 2015. I have played this game, with the same two characters, on XBox 360, XBox One, and then migrated to PC. I have invested well over 3000 hours into this game. Needless to say, it was for a very long time one of my favorites, if not my favorite. For over a span of one year, it was the only game I played.  With the most recent actions of Rockstar, by removing vehicles we have not only grinded for, but some of us had literally paid for, to place them behind a subscription pay-wall, I am uninstalling this game. For nearly a decade, GTAV has been a staple in my gaming collection. No more. No longer can I condone what Rockstar has done to it's player base. No more can I sit idly by and ignore the grift. No more will I allow this complete and wholesale abuse by a publisher to continue.  No. More.  Goodbye Rockstar. Thnks fr th mmrs.",False

"There are so many bugs you encounter every day that the game leaves you fuming after every session, and all these bugs are so very frequent like almost every session you would face multiple of such issues. Some of them are: A lot of times during missions you would get in your car but it wouldn't move. You are trying to enter a getaway vehicle during a mission as passenger and you would get stuck at the car door and not because the owner have not granted permission, the door would open but you would not be able to enter. During latest mercenaries update while doing charlie mission you would engage autopilot in your avenger but would not be able to enter the cockpit again.(There are so many bugs that listing them here would not make sense, go read a subreddit and you would know what I'm talking about) It usually takes forever to be able to join a public lobby and out of nowhere you are alone in the session, even when upnp is on and the nat settings are at moderate.

"[h1] Review #31 [/h1] [b] Brief: [/b] Important thing I want to note first is that I am giving this a positive review purely for the Story Mode/Singleplayer Campaign. The storytelling was really great, visuals were great, combat was randomly good or bad due to how wacky the A.I likes to be, which can make for some funny moments too though. Other than that, GTA Online has, for me personally, lost its value over time but that also could just be that now I've grown up and the desires to play this game when I was younger have faded away. So, overall, I recommend this game if you are purely interested in the singleplayer part of it.  [u] Positives [/u] [list]     [*] Great singleplayer story (Fantastic characters and visuals)     [*] Huge map to explore around     [*] The driving mechanics feel great as well, as well as there are a huge variety of vehicles out there to drive/find     [*] Achievements (though there was also GTA Online achievements so getting them all is a pain mostly)  [/list] [u] Negatives [/u] [list]     [*] My experiences with the combat in this game have been between good and bad. Sometimes the A.I works just fine, sometimes they can be dumb, though this can make funny moments too. Especially cop car A.I.     [*] (Regarding GTA Online): Without friends I don't see this being much fun, especially considering if you wish to even try doing most of the heists, you need 4 people regardless. Then to mention, random lobbies in GTA Online can have lots of cheaters/hackers, whatever you wanna call them. Or just downright annoying people on a flying motorbike with rockets that wont let you put even a toe outside where you live without being eradicated from Los Santos.     [*] (Regarding GTA Online): Now I have no idea why they thought making enemies bullet sponges when selecting a harder difficulty for 1.5x reward was a good idea for making it harder. Yes, it does make it harder, by just making it more annoying and less fun to play. I cant believe you can shoot some of these enemies in the face multiple times and they just get right back up. Unless everyone is the Terminator, I don't understand why they absorb bullets.

Really good game if you can take it as what its meant to be which is satire and very funny too. Sure it can be a bit weird and uncomfortable sometimes but that just makes it interesting to see what wacky things happen next in my opinion. Also very good small details that I never noticed until this time playing like there is lots of well placed hidden dialogue within phone you can pull up by calling your in game contacts without it being an objective and the different story development in story mode in general is amazingly well written.,True

"Vintage chocolate chip cookies  Ingredients 150g salted butter, softened 80g light brown muscovado sugar 80g granulated sugar 2 tsp vanilla extract 1 large egg 225g plain flour ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda ¼ tsp salt 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks Method STEP 1 Heat the oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5 and line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper.  STEP 2 Put 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar and 80g granulated sugar into a bowl and beat until creamy.  STEP 3 Beat in 2 tsp vanilla extract and 1 large egg.  STEP 4 Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl and mix it in with a wooden spoon.  STEP 5 Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks and stir well.  STEP 6 Use a teaspoon to make small scoops of the mixture, spacing them well apart on the baking trays. This mixture should make about 30 cookies.

Once defrosted, pop them in a medium oven 190C/170 fan/gas mark 5 and heat for 2-3 mins to crisp up. Don’t leave them too long or they’ll dry out. STORING DOUGH You can keep the uncooked dough in a sealed container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Simply take some out, dollop on a lined baking tray and allow to come up to room temperature for 5 mins before baking",True

"[b]Single Player Review:[/b]  It's hard to believe that this game launched a decade ago, was built to run on machines with as little as 512 MB of RAM, a very optimized title, and was, most importantly, the most successful entertainment product in history, surpassing other games, movies, and music in revenue. With a very engrossing story that expands the concept of multiple protagonists and points of view, this blockbuster of a game will make you feel like you're in a truly Hollywoodian story. With all the pop culture references, all satirizing the American way of life, the game utilizes heavy scripting to trick you into thinking the engine is way more powerful than it really is. Talking about mechanics, [i]GTA[/i] is a dichotomy: while the car handling is very Arcade, the game takes into consideration the number of occupants in the car for handling, so this is very much a design choice. Unfortunately, the top speeds are very limited due to loading, and breaking and acceleration are greatly exaggerated. All this makes driving for hours in a city grid very relaxing, different from the predecessor, [i]GTA IV[/i], which was more like a simulator. While being a car game and a crime simulator makes all sense since you can try out any car you like, still owning and keeping collections in single-player is pretty flawed. We are talking about a game full of personality that feels alive, from the protagonists, NPCs, cars, and even the city. You will never see a sunset like others after thousands and thousands of hours of playing. This game survived three generations of consoles and almost a decade and made a challenge to Rockstar: how can you make a sequence for a title like [i]GTA V[/i]?  [b]Multi-Player Review:[/b]  GTA multi-player was not the focus of the developers at Rockstar at the start; it was more like a parallel project using the game assets to build another game that would add value to the overall experience. With not a lot of activities and glitches, the multiplayer start was bumpy back in 2013, but with free DLC after free DLC, the game started getting more and more content, ranging from new vehicles to new missions. [i]The Heists update[/i] introduced a single-player-quality narrative and story online in 2015. With the addition of being a CEO or Motorcycle gang leader in: [i]Further Adventures in Finance and Felony[/i] and [i]Bikers[/i] DLCs in 2016, GTA turned into a full MMOish experience, with stock in warehouses and drugs in your factories being built and persisting over time. At the same time, we started seeing the rise in the price of content go along with methods to make money as a way to incentivize microtransactions. with each DLC trying to top the one before. In 2017, we reached the peak of megalomania with flying cars and bikes and satellites with orbital laser strikes with The [i]Doomsday Heist[/i], and since the negative feedback, Rockstar has been dialing back on this type of content. In 2019, we had a new location, [i]The Diamond Casino & Resort[/i], featuring later on [i]The Diamond Heist[/i]. In 2020, Rockstar launched the biggest update with [i]The Cayo Perico Heist[/i], featuring top-quality content, ways of making money, and a whole new island. In 2021, we had a Fast & Furious-inspired update with [i]Los Santos Tuners[/i] and a later one featuring Dr. Dre and Franklin Clinton from the single-player story in [i]The Contract[/i], with each update being shaped more and more by community feedback. With cars resembling more real ones, we see a spike in prices and anti-consumer practices as the PC version of the game still has not received the Next Generation upgrade to boost sales on these consoles.  One of the building blocks of one of the most successful role-playing mods that dominates [i]Twitch[/i], [i]GTA Online[/i], has been the target of controversy when the developers try to shut down FiveM. With the excuse to battle Cheating, a battle that had been lost, and almost making me give this game a negative review, the peer-to-peer network structure where GTA Online is built and relies on does not give any security against cheating and modding, and the game is not built to take security factors into account, as well as not having a real anti-cheat system and some simple scripts that can be bypassed. So at any time, you can see your progress destroyed, and the fact that some people try to push the agenda that cheating in GTA is somewhat acceptable only makes the problem worse.  At some point in time ([i]some of these problems have been fixed, others have been partialy fixed[/i]), cheaters could: Set themselves in god mode, use aimbots or auto-aim in free aim sessions, use ESPs and have every information about you, teleport themselves anywhere in the map, teleport you, give you money, [strike]take money from you through the insurance system[/strike], freeze you in place, stick objects on your character or vehicle, spawn explosions on every player in the session, [strike]spawn explosions on players and make look like it was other player that have done it in the kill feed (framing)[/strike], [strike]change their RSC nick name for players inside a session[/strike], softlock missions, modify the damage of any given weapon, give you weapons, [strike]remove your weapons[/strike], prevent you from being a CEO/Biker leader, eject you from your vehicle, give bad sport points that at some point send you to a session with other bad sport players, remove reports given to them, kick you from your session, [strike]get inside your private session[/strike], [strike]leak of your IP and location[/strike], [strike]corrupt your Online save file[/strike], [strike]control de weather sessionwide[/strike], crash your game; and the list goes on.",True

"After having played for over 200 hours of GTAV on PC, let alone the countless amount of hours I have also played on PS3, Xbox 360, PS4 Pro, and Xbox Series X and S, I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that is as close to a real life simulator as you can get, as you can do a countless number of different things all throughout los santos, from robbing gas stations to buying and selling stocks and other things along with completing tasks and missions. I absolutely love this game, and I love the fact now that I can run it in 4K at over 140 FPS with a Ryzen 9 5950x and a RTX 4090. Absolutely stunning eye candy. It makes the game that much more enjoyable of an experience. The fact that it has been on sale a bunch as well makes it that much more of a deal. Between this game and Red Dead Redemption 2, these are my two favorite games from Rockstar as of today writing this review for everyone. Definitely give this game and Red Dead 2 a chance since both of them are on sale majority of the time and the gameplay is impressive, it will not disappoint you, especially if you are running a top of the line PC as I am. You definitely cannot go wrong with this game. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.",True

"It's GTA V. It's a fun game, but after Rockstar removed most of the anti-cheat earlier this year there's waaayy too many cheaters trying to get you banned... Worth to buy on sale.",False
"To put things very simply, The game can be a fun time with friends. You can have private lobbies now and grind for cash and still have a ton of content or run from the cops with a friend for the nostalgia. However, there is no anti cheat and it's BAAAAD. People can rip your IP, kick you out of a lobby, teleport trap you, explode you, etc. This has been going on for a couple years now and getting worse and Rockstar has not addressed it, despite doing weekly updates and pushing content. They recently took over half the vehicles off the in game store that you can by with the in game currency, and put them behind a paywall you need to use real world money for. It's just not worth it and not worth spending money on for such a crappy experience. Between Red Dead 2 getting no love, and how they're going to try to mine us for money in GTA6 I'm not going to bother with many Rockstar games from here on out. They can't even provide a fair and safe online experience in their most popular game and would rather use it to nickle and dime their audience.",False

"TLDR: Game's trash, Online carries trashier business model. - It's not even worth 10yo chewed bubblegum. I'd steer clear from R* at all times. (RDR2 is another disappointment, better than GTA V, but still bad)  Game's a carrot to hook you into Online - all of the sandboxing elements that made free-roam in single player any good were stripped or at bare minimum downgraded into virtual uselessness... There's no sandboxing to be found other than some scarce robberies that give close to nothing in terms of rewards, and do not raise any interesting gameplay aspects.  Story's all over the place, doesn't feel entertaining unless the player isn't cultured enough, otherwise it's a filler of cliches that have been told and seen countless times from a wide range of entertainment media (films, games, books, comics). This GTA fails to bring anything substantial and new, the handful of new things they did bring are walled or give as little engaging interaction as possible.  Truth to be told RDR2 surpasses this game in every single aspect, and RDR2 isn't an example of a good entertainment product itself, given it's tailored to milk money from players through online with the story mode also railing and removing a massive spectrum of sandboxing. Both games are handled as corpo greed cash-cows and nothing else.  GTA 5 also lacks any sort of significant updates to fix broken parts of the game, never got any updates to get it closer to completion (a lot of obviously cut content can still be seen), and it's worse on both gameplay and UX when compared to San Andreas. They didn't even bother allowing most things added through updates into Online to be acquired / available in Single Player.  I'd advise to boycott Rockstar until they spill out a faithful (identical in game design and gameplay) remake of San Andreas, until than they should not see a single penny going their way - unfortunately ppl love to throw money at greedy borderline scams, but it'd be the only smart choice - Reason's that to be trusted again, they should bring back something that is trustworthy, we cannot take their word for new games, instead we should demand something we know is good so they can earn said trust back... Regardless, the game's not worth more than 10 bucks in it's entirety, it's the most awful GTA ever made, and I have a feeling that 6 will be much, much worse.  PS: It's also important to note that the Online feature netcode is utter garbage, it's hard to even join any sessions, game gets stuck, there are consistent ""unable to join session"" issues, etc... It works fine for solo play but always glitches out whenever going for any sort of multiplayer content that involves other players... It's also extremely fragile and prone to bugs, loss of progress and almost all of the activities force multiplayer, meaning that to play solo is extremely painful yet the only way to avoid issues with both glitches from R*'s end and cheaters.",False

"Ah, Grand Theft Auto V, the virtual embodiment of mayhem, mischief, and morally questionable life choices. With a collective playtime of 344 hours across all platforms, it's safe to say that I've spent more time indulging in virtual crime than I care to admit. And what a wild, exhilarating, and occasionally infuriating ride it has been.  Let's start with the story, shall we? GTA V offers a narrative that's equal parts dark and humorous, filled with colorful characters and twisted plot twists. From the heists that require careful planning to the random encounters that leave you questioning your own sanity, the story keeps you engaged, even if it occasionally veers into absurdity.  The open-world of Los Santos is a sprawling playground for those with a penchant for chaos. Whether you're cruising the streets in stolen sports cars, wreaking havoc with reckless abandon, or engaging in epic shootouts with the authorities, the sheer freedom of choice is undeniably enticing. Just be prepared for the occasional frustration when the police force seems to have an uncanny ability to teleport right on top of you.  The visuals in GTA V are undeniably impressive. The sunsets casting vibrant hues over the cityscape, the detailed textures of the bustling streets, and the attention to detail in the character models all contribute to creating an immersive and visually stunning experience. It's almost a shame that you're too busy causing chaos to truly appreciate the beauty of it all.  The gameplay mechanics are a mixed bag. On one hand, the shooting mechanics are solid, offering a satisfying blend of precision and chaos. On the other hand, the driving physics can feel like you're piloting a soapbox derby car on a butter-coated racetrack. And let's not forget the joy of being randomly flattened by an AI-controlled vehicle that seems to have no regard for your existence.  GTA Online, the game's multiplayer component, is a chaotic and unpredictable world of its own. It's a realm where everyone fancies themselves as criminal masterminds, engaging in high-stakes heists, and battling it out for supremacy in the streets. Just be prepared for a healthy dose of griefing, overzealous hackers, and the occasional twelve-year-old shouting profanities through their headset.  But amidst the chaos and occasional frustrations, there's a certain undeniable charm to GTA V. It's a game that invites you to unleash your inner anarchist, providing a guilty pleasure in the virtual realm. Whether you're pushing the boundaries of morality or just blowing off steam after a long day, GTA V offers an escape into a world where consequences matter little and mayhem is the order of the day.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a snarky and audacious playground for those who revel in digital anarchy. With its engaging story, visually stunning world, and an abundance of opportunities for mischief, it's no wonder I've spent 344 hours indulging in this virtual life of crime. Just remember to approach it with a healthy dose of irony and a willingness to embrace the chaos. After all, life is too short to always play by the rules.",True

"The online game is a complete waste of time. Full of moronic hackers and cheaters, as well as constant chat spammers. I'm Scottish, and so are Rockstar Games. For a company thats made so much money, its a total mess online and really there is no excuse in the year 2023 for this bullsh*t. Pull your breeks up Rockstar or get out of the gaming genre.",False
"GTA V is an amazing game. Seriously, it's absolutely incredible! The amount of things you can do in this game is mind-blowing. From the moment you start playing, you'll be hooked, trust me. The game was released back in 2013, but it continues to shine as one of the best games out there, offering an experience that is simply unmatched.  Let's start with the story mode, which offers an engaging narrative that keeps you hooked from start to finish. Without giving away any spoilers, I can assure you that the story is well-crafted, filled with twists and turns that will leave you wanting more. The length of the story mode ensures that you'll be entertained for many hours, providing a rich and immersive experience. Moreover, the diverse cast of main characters adds depth to the narrative, making it all the more enjoyable to play through. Whether you're in the mood for chaos or simply want to partake in some cool activities, GTA V's Director mode allows you the freedom to explore and experiment without constantly worrying about the police.  Moving on to GTA V Online, the multiplayer component of the game, the amount of content and things to do is mind-boggling. Rockstar Games has consistently provided updates and expansions that keep the online world fresh and exciting. You mentioned a few of the activities, such as bunker businesses, nightclub management, and selling special cargo and vehicles, but that only scratches the surface of what's available. The addition of heists, in particular, adds a cooperative element to the gameplay, allowing you to team up with friends or other players to pull off elaborate missions. The sheer variety of activities and the continuous support from the developers ensure that GTA V Online never feels stale or repetitive.  However, it's worth noting that the game's age does come with a few drawbacks. While the visuals were impressive in 2013, newer games have since surpassed them in terms of graphical fidelity. Additionally, some players have expressed concerns about the online component, specifically regarding balancing issues and the presence of microtransactions. Nevertheless, Rockstar Games continues to support the game and address player feedback, striving to maintain an enjoyable and fair experience for all.   WARNING Be aware of cheaters in GTA V Online. Some players may resort to cheating, using hacks or mods to gain unfair advantages or disrupt the gameplay experience. Cheaters can exhibit behaviors such as invincibility, unlimited resources, griefing, and money exploits. To minimize encounters with cheaters, it is recommended to play in private sessions with trusted friends or invite-only players. Rockstar Games actively combats cheaters and encourages reporting of suspected cheaters. Despite the presence of cheaters, don't let it discourage you from enjoying the vast and exciting world of GTA V Online with precautions in place.   FINAL SUMMARY :   If you're looking for an incredible gaming experience, I highly recommend giving GTA V a try. This game offers an outstanding adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end. With its expansive open world and countless activities, there's never a dull moment. The story mode alone is worth diving into, with its thrilling narrative and well-developed characters that will have you invested from start to finish. And don't worry, the story is long, ensuring you'll have plenty of gameplay to enjoy.  But the excitement doesn't stop there! GTA V Online is a whole new world of possibilities. You can run businesses, participate in exhilarating heists, and explore a constantly evolving online world. The amount of content available is mind-blowing, and there's always something new to discover. Trust me, you won't run out of things to do.  Prepare to be blown away by the stunning graphics. The attention to detail in the world of Los Santos is absolutely breathtaking, making the experience feel incredibly immersive. And let's not forget the fantastic soundtrack that sets the perfect tone for every moment.  Oh, and there's even more! With the Director Mode, you can unleash your creativity and become a virtual filmmaker, creating your own custom scenes and movies within the game. It's an incredible feature that adds an extra layer of fun and excitement.  In conclusion, if you're seeking an amazing gaming experience that offers endless possibilities and entertainment, GTA V is the game for you. It's a thrilling adventure that will keep you engaged for countless hours. So go ahead, jump into the action, and prepare for an unforgettable journey in the world of GTA V!",True

"GTA Online can be fun with friends, but this fun is completely overshadowed by the games countless issues. This game is filled with 5+ minute loading screens that constantly fail to load or give you error messages. This game is also riddled with hackers who will either kill you repeatedly, spam your screen with ads for their service, crash your game, or in some cases even leak your personal information live in the text chat. Yet after 10+ years, Rockstar refuses to do anything about these issues and leaves their players to deal with the games onslaught of problems.",False

"I am a 59-year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing Grand Theft Auto V. I am a single father to my son, who is now 5. My son recently started playing Grand Theft Auto V. In less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing, but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90's, so I was quite lost. I asked my son for help, and together we spent some hours playing Grand Theft Auto V. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. Playing video games reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought me and my son closer again, and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well.",True

"Ok game.  UPDATED REVIEW: After spending even more hours, I could say that it is a very good game. There are multiple types of businesses and honestly, you should just focus on having fun with these businesses. People nowadays are very stuck up with min-maxing everything to the point where they want to get the most amount of cash possible in the smallest amount of time and as someone who has been through that point, I could say that it makes the game quite boring at a certain point. Focus less on being efficient, try and find a business that you find fun, and do whatever you want and enjoy the game.  Some downsides that are apparent in this game are the number of cheaters that are able to freely roam around servers. There is also this glitch that I have been through ever since my first few hours of the game wherein when I open my in-game phone, and go to quick jobs, then join a heist alone, I am always stuck in this infinite loading screen loop. I have already searched it up on Reddit, some say that it is a problem with my internet, but some say it's a problem with Rockstar servers.   Playing with friends is also very easy and the overall user interface of the game is easy to deal with. It's also not a pay to win game, but it's a pay to get a head start type of game. I have played GTA 5 online across several of my accounts before and it is also disappointing how Rockstar decided to remove hundreds of cars from the game, I find it very unnecessary.  Now is a very good time to play GTA 5 because of how there are even more concurrent players than ever before, meaning that servers are very lively and you wont really feel brain dead in doing Rockstar's repetitive missions.",True

"In the earlier phase of playing the game I enjoyed the game, including Story Mode and Online, even right now I would say that story mode is great but the story is too short and the map and story feels too small compared to the story and side missions experienced in SanAndreas. One could just complete the whole story in less than 4 days. Now coming to the online mode the big reason I would not recommend people to go for it because of my recent experiences of the online mode, and I would also recommend people with limited budget to rather wait for GTA VI instead of buying this because as soon as GTA VI is released all the focus of Rock Star will move towards Vi which would lead to no to meager updates in GTA V. Concluding that getting to my present Online experience, right now the game is in more bad condition than it was an year ago, as I am experiencing more in game bugs, increase in hackers and multiple online sessions resulting failure, I would say that if I am playing 1 Hrs in a day in online mode then I'm actually only able to play only 40 Minutes maximum because minimum 20 minutes are being taken by bugs, hackers, session initialisation, mission start and exit initialisation, session faults. which in the end leads to more frustration rather than entertainment. My personal mission experience - I was stuck at the end point of Online mission when I was delivering the cargo to a location when my vehicle stopped moving once I reached the delivery marker when I was required to move the vehicle inside a garage but was unable to because of being stuck at the marker with vehicle not moving my character unable to get out of vehicle, then I killed myself and re did the mission and again same bug. recently when I purchased an apartment I was trying to the apartment i purchased in online mode the game got all blacked out and stopped sunning. I had to stop the game and start again. on a mission I was to hide my presence from others I hid in a place as I was being hunted by other players due to one mission in online when I was hiding in an underground parking I was suddenly teleported to another location and killed by some player who was already there aiming at me in waiting as if he knew I would appear there, then I thought it might have been a bug, but when I hid again that thing continued to happen for at least 10 times till the timer was over and the hacker and bug did my game so bad that even after the end of the mission I was unable to exit the mission I was stuck at the mission timer reaching 00:00 me being unable to exit until I switched to story mode and enter another session. This is one list of harassment going on in game these days so i won't recommend anyone buying this and rather wait for GTA VI another reason being too less online players so less that it is getting to hard to get even 4 players to sometimes host a mission. I would say GTA V is nearing its end.",False

"I will say, this is a classic game (almost too classic considering it came out in 2015 and we still dont have a sequel yet), but I have to not recommend it for two main reasons.  1) There is a severe lag issue when it comes to driving too fast. This is surprisingly one of the few games I have had to tinker with significantly to make it play well enough and that came with the issue of having to lower the graphics a lot. I don't believe it was my computer as this is a major issue that you can look up and see multiple people having on different hardware.  2) The online is filled with hackers and cheaters. Rockstar is unreliable when it comes to protecting their consumers so I would have to say if you don't know how to protect yourself well, then you shouldn't risk it because no one will be looking out for you.  If you only plan on playing the story and don't mind tinkering with your system to make it run well, then it is a good game. But if you plan on playing online or don't have the patience for fixing the game, then pass on this.",False

Just pay again and now there is no problem with the ""experience"" anymore lol  Rockstar trying to get rid of singleplayer modding because how dare you dont buy there shitty, overpriced stuff and use free and better community mods   Pandering to woke mob and trying to be woke.

"I like this game and all, but there was an update that I wish never came or they should have done some stuff differently, instead of removing more stuff then what they added in the Mercenaries Update, to be added to that this is known as the worlds worst update Rockstar has ever released to the public.   So I don't recommend Until they change the fact that they removed 150 vehicles from the GTA 5 online vehicle websites. And some of those vehicles that they removed are the ones that I was interested into buying. And now I can't because of you ROCKSTAR!  So ya I don't recommend to those new comers to this game until they change or add back some of the cars like the vehicles they added when they introduced the Auto shop to the game, LIKE WHY ROCKSTAR WHY!  #WorstUpdateEver  Ah, one last thing I hope that Rockstar adds a speedometer on the central hub when in vehicles, (And when a player is in Third-Person.).",False

"Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it receives. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this open-world extravaganza, providing an immersive, captivating, and endlessly entertaining experience for players.  First and foremost, the graphics in GTA 5 are breathtaking. The attention to detail is astounding, from the realistic lighting and weather effects to the stunningly rendered environments. The game effortlessly transports you to the sprawling metropolis of Los Santos, creating a living, breathing world that feels alive and vibrant.  The gameplay mechanics in GTA 5 are exceptional, offering a seamless blend of action, driving, and exploration. The controls are intuitive and responsive, making it easy to navigate the vast cityscape and engage in thrilling missions. Whether you're embarking on high-speed chases, engaging in intense gunfights, or simply indulging in some leisurely activities, the gameplay is consistently engaging and satisfying.  One of the standout features of GTA 5 is its incredible storytelling. The game boasts a rich and complex narrative, following the lives of three protagonists: Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. Each character is unique and well-developed, and their intertwining stories provide a level of depth rarely seen in open-world games. The writing is sharp, the dialogue is witty, and the voice acting is top-notch, creating an immersive experience that keeps you invested from start to finish.  In addition to the main storyline, GTA 5 offers a staggering amount of content and activities to enjoy. From engaging in heists and missions to participating in various side quests and challenges, there's always something new and exciting to discover. The multiplayer component, GTA Online, further extends the game's longevity, allowing players to team up with friends or engage in thrilling competitive modes.  Furthermore, Rockstar Games has demonstrated exceptional post-launch support for GTA 5. Regular updates and content expansions have kept the game fresh and engaging, introducing new missions, vehicles, and gameplay modes. The dedication to the player community is commendable and ensures that the GTA 5 experience continues to evolve over time.  In conclusion, GTA 5 on Steam is an absolute triumph of game design. With its stunning visuals, captivating gameplay, compelling storytelling, and vast amount of content, it sets the bar high for open-world games. Whether you're a fan of action, adventure, or simply exploring a vibrant virtual world, GTA 5 delivers an unforgettable experience that will keep you coming back for more.",True

It's like they attended the School of Profanity and graduated with honors. But fear not, because GTA 5 has a secret weapon: the mute button! With one swift click, you can silence those foul-mouthed troublemakers and get back to enjoying the game.

"Considering how the remote code exploit has still not been addressed publically, considering how the online game works on PC still running on peer to peer even though it is ""masked"" through proxies this game is still a cyber-security hazard for anyone playing it. This is on top of all the bad decisions on the part of Rockstar and Take Two, squeezing every last penny out of the playerbase as if this game was a free to play. But instead of it being free to play to this day it costs 80% of what i paid for it in 2016, 40 euros. It's not simply enough that someone purchases a game, no no we have to milk them for every penny after. I get it, it's just greed and opportunity. But I don't have to agree with it or think it is moral.

"4.5/10 - They are only keeping up with this game to sell you sharkcards. They just released an update that removed a lot of cars from being purchasable unless you pay for their SUBSCRIPTION.   The game sort of holds a monopoly on this type of game the ""online open world crime GTA-esque"" so they can afford to be incredibly lazy unless it's an endeavor to increase the chances that you buy those sharkcards. This guise of being a ""sandbox"" game while having many more MMO elements to the game is quite disingenuous.   By the way... they still haven't fixed the hackers. Every lobby on free-play has AT LEAST 1 hacker, many have half a dozen. What's almost worse is that the problems that hackers bring to this game were ALREADY present in the game - Griefing. Greifing is so bad in this game that it can be downright unplayable is most public lobbies that they fairly recently HAD to make it so you could run your organizations and businesses in a private session to get away from them.   This game is an insidious waste of energy and money. You're only somewhat better off buying this on console",False

"Rating: ★★★★★  Review:  Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is an absolute masterpiece that has set the bar high for open-world gaming. Developed by Rockstar Games, this fifth installment in the iconic Grand Theft Auto series offers an unparalleled experience that seamlessly blends a gripping storyline, immersive gameplay, and a vast, living world.  One of the standout features of GTA V is its captivating narrative. The game follows the lives of three protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking redemption; Franklin, a street-smart hustler looking for a way out of the gang life; and Trevor, a volatile and unpredictable character with a penchant for chaos. The intertwining stories of these characters create a rich and engaging plot that keeps players hooked from start to finish.  The attention to detail in GTA V is truly remarkable. The sprawling city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas are meticulously crafted, offering a stunningly realistic and dynamic environment. From the bustling streets filled with pedestrians and traffic to the diverse landscapes that range from urban areas to the picturesque countryside, every corner of this world feels alive and vibrant.  The gameplay mechanics in GTA V are polished and refined, providing a seamless and enjoyable experience. Whether you're engaging in high-speed car chases, participating in adrenaline-pumping heists, or simply exploring the vast open world, the controls are intuitive and responsive. The game also offers a wide range of activities and side missions, ensuring that there's always something new and exciting to discover.  One of the most impressive aspects of GTA V is its online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online. This mode allows players to explore the world of Los Santos with friends, engage in cooperative missions, or compete against each other in various game modes. The constant updates and additions to the online mode have kept the community engaged and the experience fresh, making it a significant value addition to an already outstanding game.  Visually, GTA V is a stunning achievement. The graphics are breathtaking, with detailed character models, realistic lighting, and impressive environmental effects. The attention to detail extends to the sound design as well, with a stellar soundtrack and voice acting that brings the characters to life.  However, it's worth noting that GTA V does contain mature content and themes, which may not be suitable for all players. The game's portrayal of violence, crime, and adult situations is integral to its narrative, but it's important to exercise discretion when considering its suitability for younger audiences.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a true masterpiece that excels in every aspect. Its gripping storyline, immersive gameplay, stunning visuals, and expansive open world make it a must-play for any fan of the genre. Rockstar Games has once again raised the bar for open-world gaming, and GTA V stands as a testament to their unparalleled craftsmanship.",True

"The story mode is the real treasure of this game. Little to no complaints with that. I adored the characters, the plot, atmosphere, all that etc etc. My real gripe is the online mode. It runs like total ASS. Like, I've played mobile games that somehow not only run better, but they also don't have their entire game being run by 12 year olds with $20 mod menus. It's absolutely pathetic. How much is this company worth again? This game has not produced anything generally good since 2013 when it initially launched, despite being updated constantly. We don't care about your shitty mission DLCs that are all locked behind a paywall that would impress Trump himself. Fix the game. Put the cars back. Get rid of all these stupid little Timmy's running rampant with mommy's credit card buying mod menus. The LEAST you could do for this community is anti-cheat. Jesus.",False

"Its good. I didn't like this game at first and it was sort of not that fun. But playing a couple of more hours in and its actually great. Characters are good, my favorite being Franklin. And the missions are fun and are a great ways for going into another. But I did have a problem with guns. The recoil is not even there, and the sounds are alright but it just felt weird to use a shotgun with barley any recoil or an lmg. At least snipers have them but that's it. Some missions would put you in a helicopter and its really hard piloting one of them. Other than that its a great game.",True

Thought it might have been a corrupt file or something went wrong on install but I still havnt been able to see the loading screen for the actual game yet and it says i have 7 hours of play time ffs.  Update, A game bought off steam should simply install and run. It says I have over 100 hours of play time but its because GTA5 wont close and it constantly says its running to steam. Just installed again after months and the launcher freezes instantly and still unplayable. Cant stop it from running in steam.

A girlfriend and her kid enjoyed playing so much we had 3x PS3s and 3x TVs so we could all play together at the same time. I have spent too much money on Shark Cards but got lots of cool vehicles with it. This game is not perfect. The developers are all about making money. Will GTA VI ever come out? Will it be any good? That will happen if and when it happens. In the meantime I definitely recommend GTA V/Online.",True

"Imagine, if you will. A game about cars.  The game has hundreds of cars, with new cars every update.  Some base game cars/early DLC cars get left in the dust, and ultimately they clutter up in-game websites.  Now, what would you do if you had to clean up the in-game websites?  Would you:  A. Create a new website for the base game/early DLC cars?  B. Add all of the early cars to the spawn pool so they can spawn in the world, and remove them from the websites? Allowing players to pluck them off the streets if they want them?  C. Remove almost 200 base game/early DLC vehicles from the websites, and basically make some cares IMPOSSIBLE to get on PC?  Guess what options Rockstar went with. (It was C.)  This is a blatant cash-grab move from Rockstar to add these cars behind a paywall later on.   This, along with YEARS of not updating the in-game economy makes GTA Online as grindy as modern MMORPG games.   Plus, if this is how GTA Online turns out, that means GTA Online 2 (or whatever it will be with GTA 6) will be just as bad.  I can't see myself playing GTA 6, not even the story mode. I don't want to support scummy business practices.",False

"Waaayy too many hackers in this game...... Good game but can be hard to have fun when hackers are literally quitting your game, like completely will turn off your game and you will have to load the game again from the launcher. Hackers have many commands at their disposal to even control your game and what happens to all players, not to mention they have the power to do almost anything they want with no consequences. Rockstar do not care, nor will they do anything about it. However it is a fun game and is very enjoyable at times. I do recommend it but get it on sale with the biggest shark card, you'll need as much money as possible as everything is way overpriced.  Also I will add, the servers for online are terrible!  Always disconnecting and the load times are pathetic!",True

"the new Online update removed ober 180 vehicles from being purchased which is an awful decision. Most of these will never be available again to PC players while console need to pay for GTA+ to purchase them now. Ridiculous concept, awful decisions.",False
"It's blatantly obvious that Rockstar isn't listening to their fanbase, nor do they like them. They've taken away vehicles and locked them behind a subscription, they've added new content locked behind millions of dollars only to earn about 200k in reward to doing these poorly made stories, and they've failed to give anything to progress the game aside from a few cameos of the main characters. This game needs to be revised by its dev team and redone to make everything actually acceptable to play for both veterans and new players alike. There's a reason why money and rp hacking is such a huge problem in this game and they need to update their progression and finance system to actually gain more traction than what they've gained the past few years.",False

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is a game that exists in a league of its own. Having logged in an impressive 369 hours on the game, I can confidently say that Rockstar Games has once again outdone themselves in creating a world that is not just vast and beautiful, but also vibrant, chaotic, and full of life. It's a testament to the meticulous attention to detail and the phenomenal execution of design concepts that permeates every aspect of this game. I unequivocally recommend this game to anyone seeking an immersive, thrilling, and grandeur-filled gaming experience.  From the outset, the narrative of Grand Theft Auto V is compelling, weaving together the storylines of three distinct protagonists: Michael, Trevor, and Franklin. Each character is uniquely flawed and equipped with a depth and complexity that keeps you invested in their journeys. The narrative jumps between these characters, serving up a rich tapestry of criminal undertakings that's both humorous and harrowing, reflecting the diverse realities of the fictional city of Los Santos and the surrounding Blaine County.  The mission design in GTA V deserves a heap of praise. Each task is meticulously detailed and varied, never letting the player settle into complacency. From high-stakes heists to casual errands that inevitably spiral out of control, every mission contributes to the broader narrative and character development in a meaningful way. The heist missions, in particular, are an innovative element that allow you to take part in planning, preparing, and executing elaborate criminal ventures.  The open-world aspect of the game is arguably one of the most detailed and immersive ever created. Los Santos and its surrounding areas are strikingly vast and offer a multitude of activities. You can indulge in street races, go hunting in the wilderness, play golf, trade in the stock market, or just explore the bustling city and its outskirts. Every corner of the game is meticulously crafted with a level of realism that's breath-taking. The game's dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add to the immersive experience, making the game world feel alive and constantly changing.  GTA V's gameplay mechanics are superb, providing a satisfying mix of driving and combat. The driving mechanics feel responsive and varied across the wide range of vehicles available, each with their unique handling characteristics. The combat system, too, is robust with a cover system that is intuitive, and a wide range of weapons each with distinctive pros and cons. Moreover, the introduction of the special abilities for each protagonist adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay mechanics.  Online multiplayer, introduced via Grand Theft Auto Online, provides a wholly different experience that further expands the game's shelf-life. Here, you can team up or compete with players around the globe in a variety of missions, races, and deathmatches, or simply roam the world freely causing mayhem. The continuous content updates from Rockstar keep this mode fresh and engaging, ensuring there's always something new to explore or achieve.  Graphically, the game remains impressive even years after its initial release, with stunning visual effects and detailed character models. The in-game sound, too, is excellent with a high-quality voice acting that breathes life into the characters and an extensive, genre-spanning soundtrack that complements the game's atmosphere brilliantly.  The game isn't without its flaws, though. The police AI can sometimes feel frustratingly relentless, and the load times, especially for GTA Online, can be lengthy. However, these issues are minor when compared to the wealth of content and meticulously crafted gaming experience that GTA V offers.  In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece of interactive storytelling, combining a compelling narrative, stunning graphics, a wide array of gameplay mechanics, and a detailed, dynamic world that feels genuine and vast. Moreover, the game's willingness to tackle themes of crime, morality, and the American Dream through its narrative and characters shows a depth of storytelling that goes beyond what one might expect from an open-world action-adventure game.  Rockstar’s trademark satirical social commentary is peppered throughout the game, adding a layer of intelligence and wit to the narrative. From the in-game TV shows and websites to the various NPCs you encounter, GTA V's keen critique of contemporary society makes the game feel grounded and real, despite its more outrageous elements.  Another noteworthy aspect of Grand Theft Auto V is its wide array of side activities. The game is filled with additional missions, hobbies, and pastimes that are optional but add further depth and immersion to the game. These can range from investing in real estate or the stock market, to participating in triathlons, stunt jumps, or even hunting for collectibles. These side activities not only help flesh out the world but also serve as a diversion from the main storyline, offering opportunities to delve deeper into the game's mechanics and universe.  Furthermore, Rockstar's dedication to updating and refining Grand Theft Auto Online has also added significant value to the game, long after its initial release. New heists, missions, and vehicles keep the multiplayer mode fresh and exciting, encouraging players to keep returning to the world of Los Santos and Blaine County. Plus, the addition of user-created content in the form of jobs and races contributes to an ever-expanding universe for players to explore and enjoy.  However, no game is perfect, and Grand Theft Auto V is no exception. While the AI has significantly improved from previous iterations, it can still behave erratically at times, occasionally pulling you out of the immersion. In addition, some players might find the game's depiction of violence and use of explicit language offensive, although these elements are indeed consistent with the game's mature and gritty narrative.  In summary, Grand Theft Auto V is an unparalleled achievement in the realm of video games. Its compelling narrative, coupled with a vast, vibrant world, intuitive gameplay, and an ever-evolving online component, make it a game that stands the test of time. Despite minor shortcomings, GTA V offers a gaming experience that is both thrilling and deeply engaging, making it a must-play for any serious gamer. It's a captivating journey into the dark underbelly of the American dream, offering a compelling exploration of its characters' complex personalities and motivations. I cannot recommend it enough.",True

"This game here is one of the best out there.. I just love to do missions and intract with others and drive with them for no reason in online, But the thing is hackers are making your life hard. After my work i used to take off my steam in this game. But these hackers are making the game unplayable. Killing you for no reasons. Blocking your game for no reason, Making you get attacked by trevor  and military for no reason, crashing the game, trapping you in a cage. so overall all the sessions are taken over by the hackers only. If an hacker is present in the session your game will get stuck when you enter a building, or after you finish a mission it keeps loading. so i play around 2 hours max and 1.5 hours i have to wait for the game to load or go to a session with less hackers/ a hacker who minds his own business, Worst part is Rockstar only need money they are not at all doing anything to prevent them.

"A publisher that REMOVES nearly two hundred vehicles ""to streamline the shopping experience"" ten years after release to put them behind a paywall that PC users can't access is the epitome of thumbing their nose at their users. I came back to the game after a long hiatus and find (found) collecting the cars to customize to be the most enjoyable thing about returning. Maybe I like driving the cars that no one else does. Maybe I'll never ""buy"" them. Maybe I would have ""bought"" them all. Either way, if they were available to us once, then they should continue to be so. Would you accept a car company entering your garage to remove the turbocharger that you bought with your car? Or worse, that company telling you that if you want to have the turbocharger that you'll now have to pay a premium? It's slimy.",False

"In the flour attic, crackling cookie jars danced in the laundry napkin, while crocodile soup jazzily hops on the cloud carpet. Space pirates cleaved dark sourdoughs while stardust laughed in symphonic discord. The snake god clipped feather-light with the screwdriver, while the grapevines fenced in sniffling elephant herds. Dewdrops discussed quantum physics with intertwined kittens and discovered that the harmony of time lay in a lost sock at a cosmic party. Summer rain waltzed with the indecisive thoughts of the hourglass, while the rusty trumpet sang love songs to anxious rainbow flies. The windmill spun dreamily among the lost breaths of a blue whale, and the misplaced key to the essence of everything was found under a talking mushroom.",True

"R* won't take action against modders. . .  PvP is impossible because everyone uses godmode or mod menu.  PC doesn't get content updates that new gen consoles get.  Bugs and Glitches force you to find a new lobby every half hour or so. . .  I've uploaded videos of modders being abusive, and have reported them, only to see them again in a week doing the same thing. . .  Boycott Rockstar. . .  GTA6 is around the corner, and Rockstar only cares about the money. . .  They don't give a Four letter word, about their game. . .  If they did they would implement a working anti cheat, they would fix the bugs that have been around for 5+ years, and they would show their PC players some love by giving them the same content that consoles get.
