Dont bother to enjoy Online gameplay in public lobbies Modders will do every annoying thing to mess with random people They will change your car modifications apartment and any other property interior and other details that youve spend ingame money and essentially time on Rockstars tolerance towards cheating is unmatched So there are 3 options be a cheater yourself only play with a friend group in inviteonly sessions or download a FiveM In my experience worst than Battlefield V cheatingwise
very bad too much cheater on playing online  worst GTA
fun game
too sexy things in it

Amazing game 3

It can be frustrating at times so you need to go in with the right attitude and it is good fun Be wary of Oppressor kids zooming around and blowing you up and by a Deluxo and they will stop pretty quickly
Solid Game Developer Cant wait for the next one

RACISM
Its fun and honestly made me get off roblox
Grand Theft Auto V isnt just a game its a cultural phenomenon a testament to the boundless creativity of the human spirit So grab your controller or keyboard buckle up and prepare for the ride of a lifetime because GTA 5 is an experience thatll stay with you long after the credits roll
Alright listen up gamers because Grand Theft Auto V is not just a game its a whole freaking experience Picture this a sprawling openworld city just waiting for you to explore cause chaos and live out your wildest criminal fantasies From heartpounding heists to epic car chases and everything in between GTA V throws you into a world where the possibilities are endless And lets not forget the characters  theyre like something out of a blockbuster movie each with their own story and personality Oh and did I mention the online mode Its like stepping into a virtual playground with your friends causing mayhem together or competing in wild challenges Seriously if you havent played GTA V yet what are you waiting for Get ready to unleash chaos and have the time of your life
games good just needs a lot of time to get anywhere

oldschool
Good game
nice game
Ws in the CHAAAt

fun
I get too much boom    
good game need more anime girls
The game forces you to need other players to run your empire Other players are toxic aholes Not really much fun Also the missions are super lazy They just spawn endless npcs and toss them at you No real thought went into the missions Game is like a 510 Gets boring fast
"a time capsule to 2011 the younger Millennialelder Zoomers holy grail containing precious sips of a demented but still nostalgia worthy past
some distance from release a lot of the social commentary is needlessly acerbic thanks brits lets see Paul Allens vitriol about contemporary UK culture and hasnt held up well but its lush and as coated in it as the billboard laden west coast highways from which the games wellresearched setting and landscape spring from
Online Online Gaming Gaming Online GTAO is still a hollow mess but the sheer joy of mucking around in the game engine with the boys carries it through support your local hacker alhamdulillah"
people play it
amaizing game cant wait till the other one comes out
Amazing game to play with your friends plus with the mod servers 
DANK GAME
for sure it is good wagman

Man I love this game theres nothing wrong with it however I cant play the game anymore as a new player hackers are getting more common and anytime I join a online session theres sometimes a random hacker that boosts my level from 12 to 34 and from 49 to 56 And Rockstar wont do shit It only bothers me because im new Just make sure to join private sessions from storymode or just pray you get a server hackfree

Everyone knows about GTA V so if youre looking at reviews to buy where have you been Obviously this game is great with a good story mode with three different characters Only this i wish was different was me getting account reset a few years ago because i bit the bullet on a money glitch It was all my fault and i lost the account i had since the 360 days I barely play anymore because of that YEARS of progress lol so dont do glitches and youll be good
its terrible
"Single player story is pretty great with lots of little quests and activities to do

Multiplayer has gotten a lot better as there are more ways to make money that dont require 3 other players"

"Title GTA 5 The Great Account Heist  An Epic Failorama

Review



Welcome to the thrilling world of GTA 5 where the only heist happening is Rockstar stealing access to the game you paid for Strap in folks because this is a rollercoaster ride of frustration and disbelief

So there I was ready to dive into the criminal underworld with my trusty mouse and keyboard only to discover that my access pass was kidnapped by the nefarious Rockstar account Its like buying a ticket to the movies but the usher locks the theater door and the popcorn machine is guarded by a grumpy troll demanding a secret handshake that Ive long forgotten

Attempting to rescue my game from the clutches of the elusive Rockstar account was like trying to outsmart a criminal mastermind only this time the criminal mastermind is a forgotten email address I sent messages to customer support and their response time made the speed of a snail on a leisurely Sunday stroll seem like a bullet train

GTA 5 now sits in my Steam library like an untouchable gangster surrounded by a digital forcefield I can almost hear it taunting me You can look but you cant touch sucker

Rockstar youve turned my virtual crime spree into a tragic comedy of errors Its not Grand Theft Auto its Grand Theft My Sanity I half expect to see my character ingame standing on a virtual street corner with a sign that reads Will work for access to my own game

In conclusion fellow gamers if you enjoy a good caper make sure its within the game itself and not a digital battle to reclaim access to what youve rightfully purchased As for Rockstar I hope they find their moral compass  its probably hidden in a forgotten password vault guarded by virtual dragons

"To show how much I love this game  I played for around 350 hours before I even bothered to play through the story It is such an incredibly fun game and I didnt expect how captivating the story would be I just finished the entire story for the first time and am immediately restarting the game to play through it again

I cannot recommend this game enough Online mode is a little wacky but still fun And singleplayer was absolutely incredible I dont remember a time when a game made me feel just this hard for its characters

Absolutely one of my favourite games of all time I thought people were overhyping it but its honestly not hyped up enough"
Absolutely amazing 3
my friend gave it to me and blew me up several times
Great Story

"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize theres nothin left
Cause Ive been blasting and laughing so long
That even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I aint never crossed a man that didnt deserve it
Me be treated like a punk you know thats unheard of
You better watch how youre talking and where youre walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak I see myself in the pistol smoke fool
Im the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night saying prayers in the streetlight

Been spending most their lives living in the gangstas paradise
Been spending most their lives living in the gangstas paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangstas paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangstas paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin
I cant live a normal life I was raised by the streets
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
Im an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my 10 in my hand and a gleam in my eye
Im a locd out gangsta set trippin banger
And my homies is down so dont arouse my anger fool
Death aint nothing but a heartbeat away
Im living life do or die what can I say
Im 23 now but will I live to see 24
The way things are going I dont know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me

Been spending most their lives living in the gangstas paradise
Been spending most their lives living in the gangstas paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangstas paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangstas paradise

Power and the money money and the power
Minute after minute hour after hour
Everybodys running but half of them aint looking
Whats going on in the kitchen but I dont know whats cookin
They say I gotta learn but nobodys here to teach me
If they cant understand it how can they reach me
I guess they cant I guess they wont
I guess they front thats why I know my life is out of luck fool

Been spending most their lives living in the gangstas paradise
Been spending most their lives living in the gangstas paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangstas paradise
Keep spending most our lives living in the gangstas paradise

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me"

"It is unfortunate that an advanced cheat provider who purchased the complete source code of Grand Theft Auto V from a leaker would develop cheats that far exceed the anticheats of the GTAV developers
They can crash on the computers of players they dont like they can corrupt data and they can even corrupt cloudsaved data if they can hack into the cloud
The only version of this game that has been popular and successful is the console version
In the PC version there is always at least one modder in every session
GTAV has events and depending on the cheats used by the modder they can irreversibly corrupt an entire session and potentially have a negative impact on performance
A good friend of ours has unraveled why only PCs experience casino robberies and other heists and unusual events within a session
The modder is unknowingly inhibiting script events and network events necessary for activity in the session with the functionality of the protection section in the mod menu he is using
Did you see empty roads with NPC cars completely gone in your session
Did you enter a robbery or mission and get stuck in an endless loading loop and eventually get kicked out of the mission with a network error
Crashes despite being on a very high end computer
Did you become unable to walk lose your weapon or switch weapons when in the same session with a particular player
No all of these are not coincidental
Behind those major errors and supposed bugs ignorant modders are interfering with the scripting and networking events necessary to keep the session active and maintained
The session is not well controlled and can be destroyed
Rockstar Games removed 95 of its anticheat content around late 2023 because the source code for the Rockstar anticheat was leaked
The remaining 5 of the anticheat is probably the part that Rockstar really cares about protecting Rockstars profits and game logic which validates the amount of money given in money drops and missions
I for one am not holding my breath for GTA6

Because Rockstar Games was looking for technicians who are familiar with networking related issues when they were looking for technicians
I am sure GTA VI will also use P2P connections
Rockstar Games is a garbage company that only cares about money not players opinions
Get the hell out of business"
great game you have probably heard that from everybody lol but my biggest complaint was the fact that there was no story mode dlc also the fact gta 6 isnt coming to pc on launch
loading screen simulator
One of the best games in this century loved it

lets see if gta 6 will surpass this masterpiece"

One of the greatest games of all time Story is incredibly engaging funny and well written Voice acting is some of the best in the industry Driving is fun walkingrunning around is fun flying is fun shooting is fun  most mechanics of this game were designed around truly being fun and feel great to even the casual gamer And it all runs incredibly smoothly even on my Steam Deck at a constant 90 fps with absolutely no issues Holds up extremely well graphically in 2024

"First time i played this game was on a ps4 when i was 12 now im 38 and i am suviere racist and commiting tax evasion
When i was 15 i robbed my first bank
When i was 17 i killed my first hooker
When i was 20 i moved to LA
When i was 24 i snorted cocaine for the first time
When i was 27 i became the leader of one of the biggest gangs of LA
When i was 32 i discovered masturbating and it was surprisingly nice
when i was 34 i married a beatuíful girl from Miami
When i was 35 she cheated on me and i divorced her
when i was 36 i met a new girl whom was perferct in every single way
Last year when i was 37 the new love of my life killed my whole family
Now that i am 38 years of age i will commit suicide because the oline mode in this fucking game is FUCKING GARBEGE
Goodbye"

"The single player for this is about what youd expect for GTA The mechanics are pretty tight

The online part of the game is where they put the burnt of their effort for the past ten years and thats really good

However Rockstar really do things by half measures As it stands the PS5Xbox One X version of the game has loads of content they just never ported to PC the online content never made it to the single player making it a vastly inferior experience and even small quality of life things like setting defaults for the weapon wheel have never been implemented in the online mode

Youd think that with the crunch culture and worker exploitation they practice theyd have the time 

As it stands Id say if you want to play the Online mode play on PS5"
es ist ein sehr gutes spiel man hat spass das zu spielen

I wonder what this game would be like if it took place in 1899

best game of all time  things could be more affordable  if rock star reads this hook me up with some money so i can play the missions in online mode  it is so hard to earn any money because everyone just wants to kill each other and wait around for a modder to give them stuff instead of doing any work  you guys at rock star have created an amazing online plying experience but make it too hard to get enough money to enjoy the many features offered in the game 
its fun to play

Trust bro
Rockstars social club is a joke  I can now no longer play any Rockstar games because my  Rcokstar social club account was apparently hacked and taken over  Now when I try to launch any of those games I am told the account is assigned to another social club account and I cannot play it  I spent a lot of time dealing with Rockstar support and provided screen shot after screen shot proving ownership of my steam account and the original social club account  I also included proof of purchase of both  games  After proving ownership repeatedly I was told I did not prove ownersip and essentially to take a hike and have a nice day  The ticket was then immediately closed and I was not even allowed a follow up  WIll never support anything Rockstar ever again  I own the games and they are on my steam account and still cannot play them because of Rockstar  I spent hours online doing research to resolve it myself and its clear this is a widespread problem that Rockstar doesnt care about
epic
No review needed
game doesnt work and has many issues when launching
Amazing Just amazing I got the criminal enterprise pack and it was soooo worth it

I DONT HAVE A LIFE
Too much game no 
Terrible support bigoted content and poorly built software This game stopped working three years ago probably specifically because of Rockstars dumb game launcher Ive tried all sorts of bogus troubleshooting that rockstar support tried to offer none of which worked and Ive repeated this process every year or so with no improvements Dont bother
If Rockstar could actually program and or optimize a game properly we may be able to see some betterment in this field of gaming but with nerfs to everything in order to steer people towards shark cards WHILST the game is so poorly optimized and bugged just play it for the specific abuse this company offers
you know i know my life GTA King Von

"Modders make the game almost unplayable Causing you to jump from session to session or hideout in your aparment which still wont save you depending on the modder Being nuked or instakilled while trying to transport goods really kills the elements of play that make the game so immersive

its not that I dont recommend the game its just that it will never be what it once was 

I recommend this game if you enjoy

"This review is specifically about GTA Online The story mode is an easy 45 and Id recommend everyone to play it nevertheless how shit the online mode is

The online is just ass And I dont even mean because of the cash grablife killer it has become Its more about the retarded shit Rockstar added over time that turned that mode into a true fuckfest and it all started with the Oppressor 
But as if jerks flying around on rocket puking jet bikes aimlessly blowing everything and everyone to pieces wasnt bad enough Rockstar also doesnt seem to care much about the abundance of small dick cheaters who make your gaming experience in public sessions even more miserable
Do yourself a favor play the story mode fuck the rest"
i like it buy why cant i buy a normal version  of the game for a friend i have a get a starter pack witch makes me spend more then i want
This is the best game for playing in your free time and for recording as well  The environment is properly based on Real Life cities making it more realistic  New mission makes it even exciting and i will suggest you to choose the Loud way in heists as it is amazing

My main reason for gaming is GTAPlaying GTA Games since childhood and GTAV since 2015 back in the days used to play in PS3 but sadly it broke but now i bought Gaming Laptop just to play GTA
The only one game that you go back to and spend and obscene number of hours
Great game
"Arguably upsetting
Grand Theft Auto V was amazing in 2013 But thats just it 2013

Its 2024 still has a lot of playability but GTA Online biruinedib Grand Theft Auto V
And its all thanks to the general public We could have had a few singeplayer DLCs but instead we got Shark Cards The people spoke with their wallet and TakeTwo listened Unfortunate especially considering now GTA Online is virtually unplayable thanks to negligence I wouldve recommended it a long time ago but if youre not interested in singleplayer dont touch this game

Edit Play it on console if you want to play online"

"A Timeless Classic Grand Theft Auto V

My journey with the Grand Theft Auto franchise began in 2016 when I was first introduced to GTA 5 at my friends house Watching him skillfully evade the police diving into storm drains ignited my fascination with the game Back then I owned an Xbox 360 E a Christmas gift from 2014 Surprisingly GTA 5 wasnt my first encounter with the series that honor belonged to GTA San Andreas on the PS2 emulated through PCSX2 I vividly recall cruising around soaking in the openworld experience
Later I delved into GTA 4 experimenting with mods and further immersing myself in the franchise Despite not fully engaging with the story mode I was undeniably hooked After watching all the cutscenes of GTA 5 I knew I had to play it On December 21st 2016 at the age of 13 I finally acquired a copy for my Xbox 360 albeit under the alias Franklin Clinton as my mum wasnt keen on me playing a PEGI 18 game Unfortunately a damaged disc led me to purchase the digital version marking the start of my story mode journey which took me nine months to complete
In 2018 I received an Xbox One for Christmas reigniting my passion for GTA 5 Transitioning to the newer console was bittersweet especially with the closure of Xbox 360 servers where I had amassed considerable wealth However the lure of enhanced graphics and gameplay on the Xbox One was undeniable
The year 2020 brought an unexpected gift when GTA 5 became available for free on the Epic Games Store With my recent GPU upgrade to an Nvidia GTX 1650 Super I seized the opportunity knowing the game would run smoothly on my system Fast forward to the present and Ive conquered the story mode on Xbox 360 Xbox One and PC Now with the game on Series S the thrill continues
Watching YouTuber VideoKames navigate through her first playthrough of the game was a delight especially knowing that even Ned Luke the voice actor for Michael was tuning in Grand Theft Auto V holds a special place in my heart its missions never failing to evoke a smile or laughter As I eagerly await Rockstar Games next masterpiece GTA 6 I know my love for this game will endure Framing my GTA V map and hanging it on my wall will serve as a testament to the countless memories and joy it has brought me 

PS The PC version lacks the love and support seen in the current generation consoles Despite having the ability for mods Im not a fan of how GTA Roleplay has overtaken what made this game special Nevertheless Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece and Rockstar Games should be proud of their accomplishment"

Combine flour baking powder garlic powder salt and ground black pepper Mix well using a fork or a wire whisk Set aside
Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl Add the milk mixture Continue to beat until all the ingredients are all incorporated Add half of flour mixture Whisk Add the remaining half and whisk until the texture of the batter becomes smooth

good game but its abit overhyped due to youtubers adding mods but yeah worth buying in discount

"This game used to be great fun I loved playing it and had lots of amazing experiences with my friend
Until they changed it about 2 months ago They fucked up big time
Our main source of income  the Cayo Perico heist  had its setup cost quadripuled lots of ui and menu changes made the ui and menus really confusing and idk what happened but the graphics changed somehow  I used to have the deafult settings and had pretty smooth gameplay no major lag spikes but today I turned GTA on I didnt change my settings and it lagged like pure hell about half the time Also it looked awful which it didnt before like I had texture quality at its lowest and reflections at the highest even though I had them both at Very High
And maybe worst of all  they banned my friend for basically no reason He and I were playing on a private server and he used some mod to just SPAWN VEHICHLES not give or take money not get access to a new property just spawn vehichles which we destroyed afterwards and 3 days later Rockstar emails him saying he has been banned for 30 days AND had his character WIPED Keep in mind he had never cheated before and didnt even do it on a public server and didnt change his stats in any way AND he had hundreds of hours of playtime where he legitly got a facility nightclub Kosatka multiple milions and a lot of other things including a shit ton of cars He lost all of it For spawning a few cars planes and a tank
In short Rocktar Games are a leech that wants to suck as much money from you as possible and then wipe it so you have to buy it again"
great game lots of fun to play with friends

the game is amazing and good for people that like having trouble with the  police or causing mayhem and shooting random people
i died
cd key change
This game was completely taken over by cheaters that ruin everyones game They kick everyone out of the server blow you up out of nowhere put you in the cage Another problem of this game are bugs forever loading screen and game freeze Its been 13 years since this game came out but they still cannot fix shit If Rockstar doesnt pull their heads out of their asses the game is gonna go to shit
nice game although its a 2013 game races are the most amazing things
1010
Nobody has ever not heard of GTA V It is amazing for a reason Make sure to have a top end AMD Ryzen chip hopefully 6600H and a GeForce RTX 3050 i bought my laptop for 60000 rupees for the best and cheapest possible gameplay

"Story mode for GTA V is amazing

GTA Online is too unstable to play It crashes constantly and has really slow loading times"
gggggggggggggggooooooooooooooooodddddddddd
too many hackers
I bought this game when it was at heavy discount and this is the only reason i bought It as it was so expensive and everyone knows that how great this game is and with mods it goes Next Level
just a game
love it
"Even though I dont play it as often these days this game holds such a special place in my heart Its not just about the missions or the cars its about the moments spent with friends hustling together to afford those dream rides Theres something about cruising in firstperson mode especially when its raining outside or as the sun sets with the radio playing in the backgroundit feels like Im right there in the moment

Ive never really explored private servers Ive heard they can be iffy and using accelerators for foreign ones isnt my thing either So I stick to the official servers I got into this game back in high school and now here I am in my sophomore year of college While I used to get tired of it quickly as life has gotten busier this game has become my sanctuary a place to escape to when things get overwhelming

Its more than just a game to me its a timeless escape Im eagerly awaiting GTA 6 and I have faith that Rockstar will keep pushing the boundaries and giving us even more ways to immerse ourselves in their worlds Thats the beauty of gamingcreating these unforgettable adventures"

"The PC version is horrible if you intend to play Online Too many cheatersmodders Police often spawns on top or in front of you detecting you immediately and making it impossible to escape Playing with friends is often buggy mainly when trying to invite each other to jobs or heists GTA V Story mode is fine but also buggy at times
Get the console version if you can"
gran taft outro
"I downloaded the game tried to play it and it installed a bunch of documents on my desktop to make the game launch I guess and also DELETED SOME OF MY FILES AND FOLDERS WITHOUT SENDING THEM TO THE RECYCLING BIN I had a short film idea that wasnt on my desktop but got wiped from my computer anyway

I got them back thanks to OneDrive but now Im terrified to download and try opening the game ever again

If anyone knows why this happened and how to prevent this from happening again please let me know because I want GTA VI but dont think Itll be available for the Switch"

Game made with true passion and detail

ITS GOOD WAITING FOR GTA 6

Play this before Gta 6
Its alright I paid money I got game I played game I made friends I stopped playing game Still good but too many hackers in multiplayer
The games offers a lot of varaiety ofcourse there isnt a man who doesnt heard the name GTA and the game worths every penny it has very much variety and Disclaimer Dont use the cayo perico heist glitch you will get bored do the cayo perico its ok but dont use the glitch you will be easily bored if you use the glitch the game supposed to last atleast a year or 2 that is how they made the game dont do the glitch if you use the glitch it will be good at start after sometime you wont play i used to usae glitch then i started playiong with another account of rockstars from scratch
My favorite at strip club nwys add me and give me a account pleasecouldnt afford pray emoji
why nerf cayo

look the game is fun Incredibly fun The story is great and if you dont know how the game ends by now either you play with cheats only or youve been living under a rock or both The only complaint i have is for online and the people who play it Some people are there to have a good time theyll race around the city talk and generally theyre good fun Thats the kind of person you friend on social club and do jobs with Then theres the other crowd Modders griefers and trolls These people intend to make life hell for any online player regardless of who it is There are some cases where you meet modders who will give you money and RP to allow you to have more fun in GTAs online without wasting your own money but these people are few and far between If you run into any of the group save for a good modder your best bet is to block the player on social club and find a new lobby If you do meet a modder who will give you money you would be advised to friend them to hopefully gain as much money as possible

"I like the idea of this game I like the concept This is the best driving game on the market Better than all of the other driving games I wish there were more things to do for money as a single player
I think it should be easier to make 250k  500k by yourself The little moneys are fine but they really dont allow you to grow to become a billionaire which is what you are trying to do I wish there were more businesses that could be set up as a CEO or a Boss I wish there was a version or extension pack made for adults over 18"

very good game but also very bad game at the same time
good
This game is full of damn modders Every time i have tried GTA online i have always either been greeted by someone who does not have a life or i am just given a bunch of money EVEN WHEN I DONT WANT IT And worse yet after about 30 days of not playing i log on and see i have to reactivate my account easy right NO NOT EASY because apparently rockstar likes to send you irredeemable codes that i have to put in the rockstar games thing and WORSE YET EVERY NAME IS TAKEN ALL OF EM u wont find a single decent one and WORSE YET rockstar is a pain in the ass in general because when i have to close my game on extremely short notice the game likes to verify AR YOU sure YOu waNT to QuIT BRO like YEA NO SHIT ASS HOLE THATS WHY I PRESSED ALT F FOUR DUMBASS Bitch spread the word about this USELESS ass game and GTA 6 will be shit too i fucking hate you rockstar you ignorant pieces of shit  EXTRA NOTES also cheaters frequently like to disable your internet from time to time so get that refund as SOON as you can guys this game SUCKS Not worth the fifteen pound at ALL i wouldnt get it if i was held at gunpoint
this game is therapy
akll
fucking goat game
Good game but online is ruined by hackers Cant go five minutes without someone tp killing the entire lobby Very frustrating
Whatever
goog
there are modders but some are friendly and some kick you off the game if you get those type i wouldnt recommend the game to them and there are different types of players the grinders the kind players and griefer players
Why do I have to play dress up everytime I start a mission as Michael The fact I have to google what specific outfits I have to wear for what specific mission single handedly ruins the game for me I also just finished playing 1 set of the tennis minigame with Amanda that took 45 fucking minuets and was the hardest thing Ive ever had to do in any video game ive ever played GTA 6 better be good because replaying this game in 2024 made me realize how awful it is
oppressors kids worse then a hackers

"Played for over 10 years on both PS3 and PC still one of my favourite games to play when I just want something relaxing to play Yes the money online is a grind but when you just wanna do something chill and easy its not too bad to do now and then 

Do need a pretty substantial PC spec to run it at max but most PCs would probably be fine these days Really big fan of this iconic game cant wait for GTA IV"

Online gameplay is just too much of a security vulnerability  Overall Id spent less than an hour online and got teleported to the ocean promptly killed then something or another happened to corrupt my online account  A game with security vulnerabilities of this nature which based on reddit discussions have been unpatched for more than a year shouldnt be available for sale let alone installed  Hard pass  This is even worse than Battlefield V

My goto game when Ive had enough of the real world and want to escape reality for some time Expands well upon that one mechanic every other GTA title missed  immersion Drive around the posh Vinewood streets looking for exotic sports cars or explore the Grand Senora Desert and expect random encounters with muggers or hitchhikers or take a Uturn and climb Mt Chiliad to feel on top of the world The game comes with endless hours of game play even after completing all the missions and the firstperson mode coupled with your own tracks makes even aimless driving feel fun The only downside is the wanted level system which activates even when you stealthily kill a random NPC in the middle of the desert in the dead of the night Nevertheless the game is efficiently optimized on all its ports which allows it to run even on lowend machines The game play physics is spectacular but in no way you must expect it to be near reallife since GTA Vs not supposed to be a simulation game In the end this game will make you forget all your reallife problems for a while as you step into the shoes of either Franklin Michael or Trevor and feel the Los Santos sensation
its a good game just buggy
its gta v
gchv
i JUST love this game aspecally the story
good
nice
Good game overall
cool game
too many hackers running around online play got semi trucks and jets falling out of the sky to people forcing my car to spawn in front of them or my character turning into a plant they troll you
nice game mods are nice as well but they are hard to download you cant just go onto vortex and do it that way or atleast not for me online is ok but people are mostly annoying but its fine i guess i cant be bothered typing a whole review because im trying to get the nuke operator skin in cod warzone if anyone wants to help me you can comment and i will respond eventually
Its fun depending on the type of session modder its bearable tho
too musch cheater
GOOD GAME

last one stop
this game has everything that i can do here instead of real life
"You are better off playing this on console if you want to play in regular lobbies that arent hacked or modded 
I played the crap out of this on Xbox and was excited for the steam experience when I built my PC but man little did I know of the pain  misery that was waiting when I got into an online open lobby 

Ive only ever modded Minecraft  Terraria and that has been a limited experience as I dont get the same value or fulfillment as others do after so many hours I become bored its not the real experience  its just not my thing to hack or mod 

Every regular lobby will have one or more people running hacks or some mod so they cant die or blow up I just got on after months because of the same situation I try to mess around in a normal lobby only to run into someone that is invincible It never fails Then of course I go to another lobby only for the same thing to happen again leading to me eventually getting off the game after just being on for under 1 HOUR 

The main hours Ive put in on steam are for doing heists or something that doesnt involve others which has completely taken away from making friends joining crews  just in general trying to play the game normal like how I did on console Im at the point where I am truly questioning why I even try to play this on PC

Rockstar really failed with the Steam version of this Online gameplay I truly hope GTA VI will be an improvement but I highly doubt it so Im not holding my breath and plan to return to Xbox for the next game so I can avoid the pathetic trolls  no lives of the PC World"

"The american dream viewed through the lens of 3 wildly different characters who share similar occupations Even these years later its signature satire still holds up today Pick it up play through the story once maybe twice and then shut it off again and enjoy the fun memories

As for the online version dont touch it Unless you shell out extra for a 3rdparty mod menu and pray you dont get banned you are going to get crushed by everyone who does do that  and just generally feel terrible the whole time"
just buy this shit its worth it trust fr

"Been playing GTAV since launch on the Xbox 360 and have done over 20 playthroughs 

Story 7510 felt jumpy just jumping from new bad guy to new bad guy Franklin couldve had more missions with the CGF and shit more backstory instead of just Micheal and Trevor fighting about something 9 years old but good overall

Characters 910 Some very iconic and memorable character in all of gaming

World 810 Most of it is mountains but apart from that its very atmospheric and immersive

Overall 810 solid GTA Game cant wait to see what Rockstar cooks up with GTA 6"

Playing online with your friends is a very fun activity to do but the person i played with was repeatedly killing me when i kept telling him i had no more ammo in anny of my guns i think he should be restricted to play grand theft auto for at least 5 daysalso he kept trying to hit me with an rocket launcher he knows i have an very little amount of guns to fight with so it is definadly un fair for him to do that i will continue to play but rockstar i need you todo somthing about him bullying people that are very low level and cant have or do certain things other wise the game is very fun but i wanna know how to ropleplay on fivem i could not figure out i will like some advise on how to get an server and intructions on how to play as well thank you rockstar when is gta 6 comeing out i hope soon

So fun and many new challenges and yolo whatever you want I couldnt wait for GTA 6
love
i like doing and selling drugs so this is a good game cuz it has both of them
"This game is wonderful and tons of fun with friends The quintessential crime simulator and its just as good as anyone else will say it is I will definitely continue playing it with friends for quite a long time and encourage you to also give it a try
That being said Ive encountered a few big issues which I think really hurt it

1 Its intended for multiplayer Not necessarily a bad thing until you see that for some missions or businesses you have to use multiple separate vehicles It turns what could just be a simple longer mission into an enormous headache over traveling backtracking and doing the same trip 3 times 

2 The controls are inconsistent and were imagined by a thricelobotomized maniac Sometimes its E Other times its enter Sometimes they make you use backspace but then the escape key is needed I was forced to agonize over delivering one package until I learned that that key they were prompting me was not enter nor backspace but suddenly the RIGHT ARROW KEY

3 SecuroServ bodyguards pay 100 OF MONEY THEY WOULD HAVE EARNED TO THEIR VIP Nonmissionbusiness oneoff income was observed but I havent tested further There is no toggle This is not disclosed I am now indebted to my friend because we wanted to to jobs in a group together"

"Playing this game with a keyboard and mouse is torture and i want to reconsider breathing everytime im in a plane

Besides that the game is fine"
An entertaining game thats doesnt take itself too seriously while still being mostly grounded in a reality where crime runs rampant The places the game really shines are in its heists the characters plan Namely casing a score then acquiring the things required for the job and then finally executing the heist itself The game even gives you a couple options for each heist The other big entertainment factor with the game is in the parodies of various things in the world like the talk show and news radio commentary on things that are happening in the game It makes the game world feel a bit more lived in and I can definitely see why GTA Online has cultivated a strong RP community from these things

"Grand Theft Auto Online the multiplayer counterpart to GTA V offers an expansive and dynamic online world With a plethora of activities heists and customization options it extends the games longevity However occasional technical issues and balancing concerns aside GTA Online remains a vibrant and engaging multiplayer experience in the iconic GTA universe
Since i have played this game for 300 hours in just 2 months of buying the game i can confidently say the game is very nice and fun to play
Yes there are modders and cheaters but most of the businesses can be done in an invite only session and this provides a great security from griefers
DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME IN 2024 AFTER THE RELEASE OF GTA 6 TRAILER
YES BECAUSE THIS GAME IS NOT DEAD YET AND WILL BE THERE FOR ATLEAST 23 YEARS COMING UP"

SO FUNNY
"Rockstar is notoriously shit at security If you havent played GTA in a while your account has almost 100 been compromised by hackers So what do you do The only thing you can do is message Rockstar support That shouldnt be an issue but every time you reply to a ticket youre talking to someone new That means repeating yourself a dozen times sending the same screenshots a dozen times I have been talking to them for 5 days I have sent them proof of purchase proof I own the email account the Rockstar account was linked to proof Ive purchased Shark Cards Ive sent them screenshots of my Steam profile screenshots of my Rockstar profile screenshots of my friend requests but the next day its some new person talking to me and they request the same exact information Its crazy to me how they so easily allow someone into your account but getting back into your own account is impossible In my eyes the issue is that they require you to use their bullshit buttcheeks launcher which has no benefit and only creates gaps in security They said how about instead of using Steams relatively safe and protected services we make them sign up for our own shitty hackerfriendly launcher and then when their account inevitably gets hacked maybe theyll just buy the game again

Buying a Rockstar game is just begging to have your information stolen by some man in China Their support is so bad I cant help but feel like its on purpose just to get you to make another account and rebuy the game"

The game is really good but its impossible to buy the game on pc without the stupid starter pack so i cant gift it to my friend because the bundle with the starter pack costs 30 and i bought a 20 steam gift card because i thought id be able to gift it to him with that
Timeless game with a content filled online mode
Im not not recomending it because of the kind of game it is no GTA V is a great game and i reccomend that but not this specific one because the modders make this game unplayable sometimes
i modded the game so its better
awesome
very good game 1010 must try again

"I have had lots of fun hours playing this game online but unfortunately I am unable to recommend due to one big flaw on PC

This game is plagued my modders online These are the groups that modify the game play using software to cheat and ruin others play time Public lobbies on GTA Online cant be played effectively on PC This is a known problem and a controversial issue as many like to mod and do so without interfering with others Unfortunately my experience has been often toxic individuals who are bored and have fun ruining others game play by cheating There is a big difference between getting upset that people are killing you on an online game that is PvP against modders that use god mode and remotely blow you up so you have no chance 

So why so many fun hours playing Simple me and my friends go into a crew restricted online lobby This is the only effective way to play this game Unfortunately by doing this you cant meet people in the online public lobbies to join your crew or expand your friends 

I do have concerns for GTA 6 as if it has the same problems I am likely not to bother Its a shame as the game has so much good potential and can be really fun but I would probably say get it on console where the modifications are restricted"

"The single player experience is topnotch like knockin back a cold one with your best bud The story Unbelievable Every missions got you grinnin like mad

Now heres the genius move  they toss in an ingame stock market It aint the second coming of sliced bread but its pretty damn cool You can play the market make some dough maybe even swim in millions or billions But heres the thing you end up drowning in cash like a lottery winner with nowhere to blow it Singleplayer mode though fantastic feels a bit deserted after the story wraps up Rockstars updates forget about it like its yesterdays news
Now lets talk about the multiplayer or as I like to call it the school of life for young bloods Its like a lesson in manners respect and sharing but in a chaotic online playground If you want to enjoy it with mates lock it down to a private session unless you fancy a level 1000 twerp going all mafia boss on you

And get this  you can buy a yacht in the game Real boss move huh The toptier one sets you back a cool 10000000 But heres the twist again  the most ingame money you can buy is 8000000 and thats gonna cost you a hundred real bucks Talk about highway robbery in a game thats already bleeding your wallet dry

I could go on and on about a game and a company that seem to have a PhD in squeezing every penny out of the fans shutting down companies they once praised But lets get straight to it Singleplayer Absolutely topnotch Multiplayer Stay away like its the plague GTA Online is like a case study proving that achieving world peace is easier than navigating that online circus Cheers to the campaign but keep your distance from the multiplayer madness"

very good but some of the players are hackers and so they mess with you but some other hackers give u money and levels so yea i would very recommend but just be careful

best game oat masterpice if you got the money and you aint buying gta you just ruined youre life
good story overall just dont play online unless you wanna rage 
"Singleplayer story mode is amazing with a lot of content The story is fun to play and the amount of details in the game map is incredible

Multiplayer online is a big letdown The community is full of players looking to start fights for no reason griefing is promoted and excessive mods on PC break all game barriers Vehicles are too expensive and moneymaking methods are mostly ineffective except for the Cayo Perico heist I play GTA Online alone more than with anyone else

I suggest singleplayer over multiplayer unless if you have a group of loyal friends to play with"

"Earlier game was kind of good Cheats was rare
BUT TODAY 220124
Servers are full off cheating kids almost all ppl are on GODmode u cant kill guy with 10 shots of bazooka and he is killing u instantly u need to just respawn position on map is doesnt matter
U CANT REPORT CHEAT beacuse he is hidden on player list even if he is visible nobody kick him beacuse rest ppl using cheats too
Cheat can kill all ppl on the server ON YOUR NAME it looks like u have cheats
ROCKSTAR is making NOTHING"

"TLDR This is the most buggy game Ive played in years possibly ever

It seems like every other mission requires altf4 and a reload to work The very first mission bugged back to back and I almost didnt bother racing Lamar and requested a refund Ive had the game crash 3 times so like 1 crash per hour basically I picked the Cool Cat clothes and the cat graphic on the shirt constantly disappears etc 

For system specs I have a AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 3080 TI Samsung Evo etc so it shouldnt be related to hardware as I dont even run the game with maxed out settings 

Biotching aside I havent played a GTA since GTA3 on PS2 and despite all the BS buggy issues I found it fun enough to keep booting the game back up I have a thumbs down because with the games popularity time since release and resources available at Rockstar I dont think the stability issues are acceptable

Honestly I havent experienced a game this buggy in recent memory not Cyberpunk at launch not New World at launch not INSERT BAD LAUNCH not any EA indie game nothing its actually pretty absurd"

GTA V is like the Swiss Army knife of the gaming world  it has everything and I mean literally EVERYTHING that we could have only dreamed of in GTA San Andreas
list
    Extensive Car Customization
    Playing as Multiple Characters
    Underwater Exploration
    Stock Market Trading
    Real Estate and Business Management
    Leisure Activities
    FirstPerson Mode
    Detailed Heist Planning and Execution
    Control a Dog
    Movie Theater Visits
    Hunting
    Interactive Internet
    Bounty Hunting
list
and many other things that are not on the list

Basically you can spend countless hours just customizing your ride and driving around either obeying traffic laws or more realistically seeing how many you can break before the ingame law enforcement starts taking notes

"I mainly purchased this game for the Online mode however a month ago I have decided to relieve the memories of 10 year old me who played the story mode on the good ol PlayStation 3 back in 2013

Running triathlons participating in different kind of races calling friends for hangouts participating in different random events discovering some weird but hilarious strangers and freaks props to Nigel and Mrs Thornill funniest characters in GTA 5 Ive ever witnessed exploding myself while trying to do the knife flights challenges checking LifeInvader of each playable character to really get into the story hunting for deers laughing my ass off while I brought all 3 playable characters together made them play golf and watched as AI was absolutely awful at this game

Story mode in GTA 5 is such a GOAT and I really wish that those DLCs that were planned wayyy back could see the light 

If you are purchasing the game for story mode absolutely go for it If you are purchasing it for online only eh There are more fun online games with way better servers which dont make you spend half of the time in loading screens out there buddy"
grand trand arand five
fun
IT VERY GOOD STORY AND I APPROVE
Thousands of hours of gameplay I love it
This game has been the source of many of my most fond gaming memories The base game comes with a rich story line based in a Los Angeles lookalike city called Los Santos In single player mode you get three very interesting playable protagonists each complementing the others in their own way You have Michael a retired father figure who is upset at the universe for his own doings Franklin the young gangster who is ready to chase some paper but still has some lessons to learn about the world of organised crime Lastly there is Trevor Trevor is a maniacal methaddled criminal who lives in bumfck nowhere north of Los Santos The three characters all have their own side missions and personal quests that will grow their strengths and sometimes even show their weaknesses 1010 Single player After finishing the single player I jumped into GTA Online Since they do regular updates and content additions for free the GTA Online community is still strong with a large player base Mod menus do seem to be a dime a dozen so you do need to be ready at any time to spontaneously combust If they are too annoying you can play single player or do a Crew session to keep them out If you enjoy grinding missions to buy a fancy car or apartment building an underground criminal empire or shooting pedestrians I would give this game a shot
game is great but if gta 6 doesnt come out next year im never playing again along with other people that dont want to because gta 5 makes money still

"Caros desenvolvedores do GTA V
Gostaria de expressar minha profunda gratidão pelo impacto positivo que o jogo teve em minha vida Como pai solteiro de uma criança especial enfrento diariamente desafios únicos Foi surpreendente perceber como GTA V se tornou uma ferramenta valiosa para fortalecer nosso vínculo
A imersão no mundo do jogo nos proporcionou momentos de descontração e lazer algo que muitas vezes é difícil de encontrar em nossa rotina A variedade de atividades no jogo permitiu que eu e meu filho explorássemos juntos criando memórias preciosas e fortalecendo nossa conexão
Além disso a narrativa envolvente e os desafios estratégicos do jogo estimularam habilidades cognitivas e de resolução de problemas em meu filho proporcionando uma experiência educativa de forma divertida
GTA V para nós transcendeu o rótulo de apenas um jogo Tornouse um meio para enfrentarmos desafios juntos crescermos como família e encontrarmos alegria em momentos compartilhados Agradeço sinceramente por criar algo que vai além do entretenimento e se transforma em uma ponte para conexões mais profundas e significativas"

so lets get started here I played gta for 77 hours Then I come to a problem The problem is that when I try to start gta it just doesnt start Ive tried every way possible I think and its not working I would recommend it but I would not spend 30 dollars on a game I cant play
wow
I am a 55 year old biker and trucker father and probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 15 now My son got this game for from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 12 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories
good fucking game

"Grand Theft Auto V GTA V is a groundbreaking openworld actionadventure game that continues to captivate players worldwide Released in 2013 it remains a benchmark in the gaming industry for its expansive and detailed virtual recreation of Los Santos a fictionalized version of Los Angeles

One of the standout features of GTA V is its compelling narrative told through the perspectives of three diverse protagonists Michael a retired criminal Franklin a streetsmart hustler and Trevor a volatile and unpredictable character The intertwining stories create a rich and immersive experience complemented by exceptional voice acting and character development

The games vast openworld environment is a playground for mayhem and exploration The attention to detail in the cityscape from towering skyscrapers to gritty alleyways is truly remarkable The sheer variety of activities missions and side quests ensures that players always have something engaging to do whether its highstakes heists adrenalinepumping car chases or more leisurely pursuits like golf and tennis

GTA V excels in its ability to seamlessly blend action humor and social commentary The satirical take on modern society celebrity culture and the pursuit of the American Dream adds depth to the narrative The radio stations and ingame media provide a humorous and insightful look at the world making the game not just entertaining but also thoughtprovoking

The games multiplayer component Grand Theft Auto Online extends the experience beyond the singleplayer campaign With its constantly evolving content including heists races and a variety of customizable options GTA Online has maintained a dedicated player base fostering a dynamic online community

However its worth noting that the game has faced criticism for its mature content including violence and explicit language This may not be suitable for all audiences and potential players should be aware of the games content before diving in

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V remains a monumental achievement in the gaming industry Its combination of a compelling story stunning openworld design and diverse gameplay options make it a mustplay for fans of the genre While the mature content may not be suitable for everyone those who appreciate a gripping narrative and a vast immersive virtual world will find GTA V to be an unforgettable gaming experience"
cool
Honestly with all the shit going on in my life i need an outlet for my anger and sexual frustration I play this to help me cope with all of that and i still want to commit a felony 1010 
"Harmonious and orderly society
Friendly coexistence between citizens and cops"
nice
Except the fact that starting and finishing a heist is pretty difficult because you need all 4 players to participate and succeed its a very cool and realistic game with a hight fun factor enjoying driving vehicles
Grand Theft Auto V by Rockstar Games presents a captivating exploration of cultural narratives set within the diverse and intricate backdrop of the fictional city of Los Santos The games trio of protagonists  Michael Franklin and Trevor  offer a multifaceted perspective on life in a Western urban setting resonating with the experiences of adapting to new cultural environments The immersive openworld design combined with stunning graphics transcends geographical boundaries providing players from various backgrounds an opportunity to engage with and understand a world both familiar and foreign Moreover GTA Online extends this experience facilitating multicultural interactions akin to those encountered in diverse societies This game is more than just entertainment its a bridge between cultures a tool for understanding and a canvas for exploring the complexities of different societies Grand Theft Auto V is an essential experience for anyone intrigued by the rich tapestry of cultural landscapes and the dynamics of urban life

"For the people asking is it worth to get GTA 5 in 2024 right now I think it is if you want to play this game for online mode I will just tell you its ok because online mode is just earning money not more than that and when I say earning money like from doing heistsmissions and from nightclub one of the best things to earn money from When you earn money enough to buy your dream car you wont focus on another thing like you will just think this game is over Only if you want to play for fun with your friends then this is something else
If you want that game for story mode then gg I didnt try to play story mode but I think online is much better like the story is meh thats  my opinion  you can watch youtube videos to earn money faster no need to waste so much time on this game anymore"
still a great game in 2024

"There is no reason to play this game referring to the online the story is recycled from the campaign and better older games gaining money is pointless because of hacks the vehicle sandbox can be better replicated in other games and has little to no staying power in terms of fun payday did better heists fortnight does better racing and literally every game on earth with a functional crouch button beats this in stealth any game with a functional firearm and crossplay beats its shooting mechanics and warframe has it beat when it comes the the sheer length of the grind and the rewards you get from it 

shit game i regret spending hundreds of hours wasting away on a pointless shitty grind

GTA Online is fine at the beginning but recently the new content getting boring and more bored I know its not a DLC but the content really too short and no sense Sometimes come with bunch of bug BTW still a lot of cheater bomb you here and there
GTA 5 Online is probably the most scummiest fucking thing ever ignore my high playtime because that was before i realized that this game was made to take your money and nothing else Almost every single person i came across had a mod menu and Rockstar isnt doing anything about it Normally video games are meant to be a way to have fun and chill out except this game is nothing but a chore Grinding is so fucking boring and i know that its supposed to be like that since youre doing the same missions over and over again but my god are some of the missions just fucking bullshit like why cant i carry 3 crates at once Why do the enemies have perfect aim Why do some enemies not die from a headshot but some of them do Why did some missions get nerfed And why the FUCK is there a cooldown after every single fucking thing i do Whether it be missionsphone or the interaction menu there is always a cooldown The answers to these questions is one thing and one thing only money Shark Cards Rockstar is doing everything in their power to make you spend money on this game and not giving a shit about any other game RDR 2 because they havent made a game since 2018 and no the shitty mobile port doesnt count Rockstar is probably one of if not the most scummiest video game company i have ever seen

"Many good memories on XBOX none on PC If you like children with mods and hacks to abuse you in the ONLINE section of the game then go ahead and play You will be trolled banned kicked and abused

ROCKSTAR Support is a joke dont bother

If you like Story mode its a 1010 game we all know that but as far as its ONLINE Play goes Do not bother"
good fun good
good
best with mods
d
god of games
you cant talk to other people
since nobody gonna see this  big gyat men
too many hackers and modders in almost every public lobby Ruin the fun of the game Rockstar is sleeping on this smhhh
So rude
I want to love this game i really do  Dont get me wrong its a great game high quality story line  The AMOUNT of glitches exploits cheaters and overall average iq of players being about 3 or so make this game a fucking nightmare in online  Find some friendly players and play in invite only matches unless you want to spawn into a warzone where a lot of the time the enemy you face is literally invincible because there is no anticheat  I would give this a thumbs up if not for the sheer volume of glitches and braindead skill less players that use mk2s the new stealth vtol and straight up fucking mods and hacks
yes

very good
NICE
please play 18 player only

As much as I love the GTA world been a fan since the very 1st game but Ill never be able to play and complete every aspect of the game with all the different ways the story can go or get into the online world because of the toxic nature people have in gaming in general I do think this is a legendary game to experience Enjoy it for the next 2 years since GTA 6 was announced and once that drops itll be all GTA 6 for the next decade
yes
I Like Making Coke And Committing War Crimes D
Its fun As long as your willing to grind and you buy the DLC to help kick you off its a good time

"Played only on single player This game hits the spot if you want to race around a city and be an outlaw The story is not that interesting to me and the characters are underwhelming although you may find them crudely entertaining at times You will unfortunately be stuck very often listening to unlikable characters go on and on when you just want to try to outrun cops jump motorcycles off of cliffs fly planes or fight gangsters The gameplay in the missions is very fun though You may want to get a controller that has little joysticks on it like a generic xboxstyle controller because youll want to precisely control your speed and angle of movement but you can get by with using a keyboard and mouse You will have to deal with the Rockstar launcher but it is doable

Overall its a fun game and I recommend it"
Worth for money
Yes

"Grand Cleft Awooga the Fifth Jr is a good game Michael is a washed up bank robber with repressed memories and that classic boomer I hate my wife mentality that I enjoy playing as

"Utter garbage

Played 10 minutes of the Story Mode and had to stop Couldnt listen to another word of the developers attempt to have the main character sound cool by butchering every word of the English language that came out of its mouth

Played the online gameattempted to resupply the MC bar and found the MC bar supply delivery van doors to be bugged Undriveable somehow manages to flip on its head from a standing potion Not a great start but there is a simple fix for that one Then attempted a MC contract mission drove to site killed everyone destroyed enemy choppers stole some ugly looking flying motorcycle delivered it to some clown who wants it but found that no matter which button I pressed the Spongebob cargo chopper would not release the cargo I could write a couple more paragraphs from what I have seen in the short time I have played this console garbage One will do

hello jacob
i love how alot of the online heists are unplayable not because of the overwhelming amount of hackers and modders flooding the lobbies but the actual game breaking bugs that they just refuse to fix for some fucking reason whats funny is that the only reason there isnt as big of a modding problem on console isnt because rockstar cares more about it on there its just that consoles are hard to jailbreak jesus i hope 6 isnt this bad if they do make a new online

Пятую часть я долго не мног пройти так как особого желания небуло но что то мнея повело на то чтобы пройти сюжетку и увидеть какова история 3ох главных героев Игра по достежениям может быть не возможной так как в GTA Online мировые рекорды побили читеры от 3  10 секунд в гонках и других мисиях Отчасти себя скажу пройти сюжетку стоит хотябы 5 милионов доллоров в онлайне Как то сравнить её с другим частями Grand Theft Auto не могу так как они довольно сильно отлечются
game
I have no problems with this games story mode in fact it was a great experience and I really liked the missions that this game offers However this is not the case for this games online mode Rockstar should improve their anticheat system because it is really ineffective Everytime I log in and play GTA online I either got killed immediately by some hackers or I got teleported everytime to a random place by them The online mode in this game has reached the point where it is unplayable when it comes to public sessions Please rockstar improve your anticheat system because if this continues then many people will lose interest in this game and you rockstar could lose a lot of profit I mean this game had been published since 2013 so  I dont think that you guys care
Not able to start the game when the associated Rockstar social club account is lost Rockstar support does not provide any help What a fantastic experience 
You know this game

ist OK
bring out gta6

perfect
best game
god
Dylan Plz buy it
game sucks
Online mode is basically full of cheaters
"This was a great game for its time The physics vehicles story and gameplay make for a very fun game but my god does this game have some serious issues with its online mode Majority of heists and gameplay used towards getting money are convoluted and boring The pricing for vehicles are stupidly inconsistent and imo some should just not be in the game to begin with Every lobby is ridden with modders or hackers either blowing you to smithereens every time you respawn or exceedingly raising your rank and giving random amounts of money  

My hope for GTA 6s online is that it centers more into the roleplaying aspect of the game Make the world feel grounded have different kinds of roles and ways of making decent money Have illegal roles like hitman gangsterdrug dealer bankrobber mobster but also have like more honest money making roles like hunting businessman or mechanic etc to make the world feel more opportunistic But above all FIX YOUR ISSUE WITH HACKERS"
Story mode is amazing but online is pretty ass
Why did I move here Guess it was the weather
GTA V is a little overrated But its hella awesome
best game ive played in a whille came a little late to play but glad i did3
this game made me sad

"Do not buy from Rockstar Game will not launch and says it needs to be activated I have played GTA V for years on this original copy purchased right here on Steam

I contacted Rockstar and they said to buy another copy and activate on a different account

I contacted Steam and they said nope cant help Contact Rockstar see above"

gta has the awesome key to use ur fav cars and rob banks and tons of shit i like the most
good game play with family
The best way that I can describe the GTA 5 experience is simply freedom The game simply has no boundaries You want 1v1 people go for it car meets heist drug operations flying stealth story mode chaos it does not matter This game has dominated for over a decade now and there is a reason for that The story is excellent the online while it can be annoying at times is very well done There are games that I would consider masterpieces like God of War and Elden Ring while GTA 5 may not be a masterpiece in the same sense as those two mentioned it is simply timeless 1010 would recommend

"MainStory was great and definitely fun to play through the gameplay mechanics of GTA havent aged at all and are still refreshing if you boot it up after a couple of monthsyears theyll probably still be fun in the next ages just the multiple main characters were something I had to get used to at first but didnt mind after the first couple of hours of gameplay 9210

The multiplayer has a bunch of flaws though which just have gotten worse over time I havent played in years but I remember loading into an online lobby usually took when you were lucky 1015 minutes without any errors but the constant money farming and the unbalanced vehicles is basically what killed the fun for me its like either pay for microtransactions or farm for multiple tens or hundreds of hours some GTA dollars to buy some mostly useless addon to your base vehicle etc for the majority just to have it easier to kill other online players which is for the most part completly irrelevant The heists were great fun aswell as the custom gamemodes and races with friends there was endless amounts of content and hours you could put into it but for the heists you also had to do a bunch of farming before being able to do all of them 810"

"Let me preface this that my review is mostly towards GTA online GTA V single player is a well made game and probably worth the price despite it being 10 years old and having received zero updates or improvements 

GTA Online is still a buggy mess after a decade I think the coding that made this game in 2013 was a shaky foundation at best and complete spaghetti code so convoluted nothing fundamental can be improved or fixed at worst It has been 10 years and I still get loading screens as if Im on Xbox 360 with a HDD Its 2024 and more times than I can count I enter a building and am greeted with loading screens for 3 minutes before I give up and alt F4 The inventoryinteraction menu is unbelievably unintuitive and frustrating to use You have to go through 10 different options fumbling around to heal yourself The phone call system is still obnoxious as ever Constantly berated with calls emails texts and notifications from characters begging me to do or buy something WHERE IS THE DO NOT DISTURB FUNCTION My mechanic takes about 30 seconds to pickup his phone and half the time cant get my car to me This was an issue in 2013 Matchmaking is a joke If you load into a job you will rarely get to play a full match You have to start the match in a public lobby to actually be able to invite anyone The awful pay for the jobs contributes to the problem as why would anyone want to play this race for 5k when there are better ways to make money The money you earned is directly tied to how long you played so its better to just afk the mission than play Original heists still require 4 people and force end the mission if someone leaves I cannot tell you how many times Ive had an error loading into GTA Online and get sent back to Storymode WHY CANT YOU REQUEUE ME 

Rockstar loathes its player base Zero communication ever Programming cars to swerve into while driving Nerf payouts of everything Force players to glitch desired outfits like police uniforms and then blacklist and remove them We can buy police cars now but not uniforms I cannot believe it took a fucking decade to add police cars you can keep Players have been asking for cops and crooks dlc for years and get only some half baked police cars They even made the police suv a console exclusive Arbitrary limits to the number of CEOs in an online session you need to be one to do any mission Add blatantly overpowered vehicles for players to grief you Encourages players to grief you by making you a target on the map when selling stuff you can do sell missions in solo lobbies now only took 5 years to add but still You have to install Rockstar launcher to play Horribly unoptimized for online Tanks your FPS going online from singleplayer Poor vehicle diversity max like 5 different car spawns Sell missions forcing you to use 4 of the slowest vehicles in existence and drive across the map back Die on a mission and need to retry Any snacks and armor you used will not be reset so back out and restock or good luck Playing with some people and you exit the lobby Good luck finding them you are put into a different lobby Not fun just bad game design 

The economy is still inflated beyond belief 5 million dollars for a police car 2 million for a mustang 400k for a rifle They have made strides in improving money making capabilities with solo heists and improved business payouts but you have to be experienced and willing to grind You need millions of dollars in properties to be able to make any significant money which is why they have a starter pack You practically need this to play if you are new Shark cards give you a pitiful amount of money for how much you spend please dont give rockstar money buy a 100 billion dollar account from modders for like 5 dollars This game has somehow been kept alive and milked for a decade from casual players and whales giving in to micro transactions 

You think CSGO or Rust has a cheater problem You wouldnt fucking believe the number of cheaters on PC Its basically in the TOS that Rockstar doesnt care if you use a mod menu They even reward them because they dont ever ban them but will ban you if you do a money glitch God mode glitches never get patched or banned  There is zero punishment for cheating Every other person is cheating Maybe not overtly spawning spaceships and putting you in a death loop but casually playing in God mode grinding Abysmal security for online where modders can get everyones IP You played a heist and the money was never paid Support will tell you to go fuck yourself There isnt even an option for missing money on support they couldnt care less

They treat PC like last gen consoles by locking PC out of content on new gen consoles They REMOVED 200 VEHICLES for purchase and made them available on a subscription service gta Animals have been added into online for consoles only PC has the best hardware and doesnt get the animals Something that shouldve been in the game to begin with 

They just keep adding DLC with more bloat They add so many vehicles that nobody ever uses and just keep adding more and more The missions and heists they do add are pretty good Although a lot of them require multiple people to play  

If Rockstar had any competition we would have had GTA VI years ago and a much better game Instead we get this shit show Cautiously optimistic for GTA VI Rockstar is a shell of its former self The heads of the studio that made Rockstar great have left the company"
"Third party launcher AND required account which the game is forever bound too Regret actually buying it on Steam because WTF was the point

My fault I guess but I do not know whatever email I used to to activate this in their shitty launcher a SECOND time since I ALREADY PAID FOR IT THROUGH STEAM Their support is not support just a website and the number they have just says to go to the website

I am sure it is a great game I had fun when I played it ON MY STEAM AAAAND ROCKSTAR ACCOUNT but be sure you remember you credentials unlike stupid me which actually is completely ridiculous"
this game makes me hard i really recommend
got called the n word pretty cool would recommend
heel store is W
FUN
I absolutely love this game I have played for thousands of hours on all platforms in total A musthave for every gamer
i like to run people over
Greatest game of all time
the lester mision
Let me start by saying that I have never cared for the GTA style games GTA RDR Saints Row etc but a friend gifted me this because i needed a change of pace to play with friends I dont love the game by any means and while Im still not a fan these just arent my preferred games I can see all the hype The game is very well made and even after being more than 10 years old still gets regular updates I still havent been made a fan but i do rather enjoy playing and just messing around with friends 1010 DO NOT RECOMMEND ONLINE PUBS THOUGH Its private friend sessions and story mode for me If you play online outside a modded or 5M server prepare to hate every moment of it
amazing
good fun broh
nice game
DO NOT OPEN THE GAME WITH YOUR PARENTS IN THE ROOM I BEG YOU PLAY THIS ALONE PLEASE MY BACK IS RED
THIS GAME IS LOWKEY SICK AS HECK
I love the GTA series and V for the PC has been really awesome Runs smooth and fast I have a 2060 GeForce RTX and It looks so vibrant Its perfect if you want to play online the downside you tend to run into hackers im hoping in the future GTA VI online lobbies they have something that wont let that happen Also on the online I usually run around by myself but its way easier to make money these days so the content is always there All in all I highly Recommend it to anyone also if you like to add me I can help you just ask me in a DM
Spend approx 4 minutes in the casino blowing your allotted 20khr that the casino restricts you to until you blow through the savings account from that mission you ran that took 4 hours to set up simulator
too many cheaters
ddgs
SO GOOD
Good game frfr
There is a ton of stuff to be done on the online but unfortunately it is plagued with cheaters ruining the fun for others you can join a solo lobby and grind but it will get old after 100 hours give or take
h
Fun when able to play online in private sessions
"Story Mode is just as exciting and good as youd expect

Online is boring just constant requests to join heists from players and a constant barrage of notifications for features no one uses anymore"

The Story Is SOOOOOOOOOOO fun It has great characters are so cool
GTA Online  Cheater edition Want cheaters play GTA Online I was just playing around with a new vehicle I got some one drives to me shoots me with explosive gun teleports to me Kills me again teleports me to them Same thing I change lobbies another cheater instantly spawns me and entire lobby Guns us all down I try to do a mission lose all my weapons I spawn in a public lobby from mission instantly get crashed by infinite things spawning on me GTA online If GTA VI is like this might as well not play it Only good thing in this game is singleplayer and private lobbies Sad Played 15 lobbies 15 griefing cheaters
its great but the only downside is if a modder gives you levels you get kicked even if you didnt ask for them

This is one huge rip off of an online game  Virtually impossible to play without modders crashing your game in some way  It happens 100 of the time I play   This game has become dangerous to play because it opens up your computer to hackers    Dont bother spending your money here  Rockstar refuses to fix the issue dont give them your money

"h2 i You wake up one day and your legs they just give and you just cant run anymore ih2

Pretty easy to see why its one of the top games ever Shame it never got a proper campaign expansion due to Online being a Depositorysized piggy bank You come in for the guns action clever dialogue and whacky antics and leave thinking about integrity betrayal friendship and whats truly valuable to ones heart

I wouldnt say its my favorite open world of alltime cuz it aint But I admire it for what it was and it excelled in just about every way aside from the occasional instance of clumsy pacing or boring mission objectives

Obvious recommend for anyone who likes modern action drama and a lotta swearing"

this game is the best fking game EVER THANK YOU ROCKSTAR
dont understand why not to get it

yoyo
its a LOT OF FUN

tervor ded me sad
cause its not game its trend
This game helped me realize that V is a Roman numeral for the number 5 I was confused until they showed that beginning scene where they called each other a n1gg
Other than the little shits that ruin the open online session experience by chasing you around on Oppressors or abuse mods they paid for this game is actually one of the best games to have ever come out If youre into robbing getting money guns racing anything remotely car related or getting railed by modders this game is 100 for you The story is also really good
This game made my wife have an affair with the neighborhe fucked me too Turns out were swingers 1010 would recommend

If you can get over the fact that every single online lobby has a modder or 10 in it then its great Otherwise make your own closed friend session and have fun Whenever you go into public lobbies and try to do any PVP the other guy just turns on God Mode and Explosive Bullets and starts one tapping you until you leave Good game though
ITS VAREY GOOD

"Delightfully addictive and hard to put down Grand Theft Auto V offers a fantastic sandbox world to play in with a well flowing story and expansive online mode In regards to solo play GTAV gives a classic story of criminal success and lets you feel like a truly powerful while letting you tap into your inner sociopath The three main characters are by no means good people trying to live their lives while trying to separate themselves from their pasts Despite this their actions would soon come back to haunt them no matter who you play Its by no means a masterclass in story writing but its hashed together well enough and more than enough moments of fulfilling a power fantasy that you wont pay it much mind Furthermore the world of Los Santos itself does what GTA as a series has always done well Creating a snapshot parody of American culture at the time While always crude and satirical coming from 2013 it does have some dated aspects compared to the current year but the game is rated M for a reason

As for the online mode it further enhances the power fantasy by letting you create your own self insert meeting all the notable characters of the main story and letting you carve your own path to criminal underworld infamy while amounting tremendous amounts of cash along the way I will admit I most often play in private lobbies as an introverted person and having tried online more seriously in the past few months its really difficult to get a start in the world without doing a notable amount of research into whats worth prioritizing start with the drug wars series in Sandy Shores by the way Additionally and while I later learned the reason for it its obnoxious that after every mission I do with friends were always sorted back into individual private lobbies or worse put into public ones These issues aside I delighted in roleplaying with friends online and forming our own criminal empires while snatching up businesses and running missions

All in all GTA V is still worth your time over a decade after its original inception"

good with friends or in private servers otherwise too many greffers and hackers
its a great fun game cant wait for gta6

One of the best games of all time for sure I mean being able to play game where you can shoot people go in strip club and many other different illegal shit in 21st century is perfect 1010
havent finished the game yet but the very start of the game felt a little slow to me for some reason probably just me but i pushed through that and its a very fun game so far

"After years of hearing the hype I finally caved and jumped into the chaotic world of GTA 5 on PC and let me tell you it was about time This game isnt just a game its a wild uncontrollable rollercoaster of absurdity especially thanks to one Mr Trevor Philips

Trevor the human embodiment of a no filter policy is like that one friend who always gets you into trouble but you cant help but hang around because theyre just so entertaining His unpredictable antics had me in stitches whether he was rampaging through the streets in his underwear or waxing poetic about lifes injustices while piloting a stolen helicopter

The graphics still hold and are crisp and detailed making misadventures through Los Santos a visually stunning experience And on PC the modding community turns this already insane game into a surreal playground where anything can happen Want to see Trevor riding a flying bike dressed as a pikachu Theres probably a mod for that

The storyline is gripping but lets be real  its Trevors show The missions involving him often left me in a moral grey area but always with a smirk on my face His dark humor combined with the games satirical take on modern society makes for an unforgettable experience

GTA 5 on PC is a masterpiece of madness and Trevor is the cherry on top of this chaotic sundae If you like me are late to the party dont worry  the party doesnt start until Trevor shows up anyway 1010"

This game has its ups and downs as every game does but if youre looking for something to just kick back and play this is your game Theres numerous amounts of things to do customize cars hangout with friends or go on a rampage Its just overall an enjoyable game so Id definitely give it a try
10 years and its still good
"Rockstar are incapable of managing an online atmosphere despite making billions from it Game is rampant with hackersmodders that will boot you from a gamesession due to their fragility 
Despite billions of dollars being pumped into a company being completely incapable of having a playable online space is a an embarrassing joke

The story is alright but the complete lack of effort managing online unless it involves a cashgrab makes Rockstar a garbage company"
good
Its gta you know if its good
great
ppp in a cupp
I like to get drunk and pay prostitutes to touch my wiener

This game is fun and the story and online are impeccable
I changed my email on steam and Rock Star wouldnt help me recover account even after I gave them all requested info Out 5900 
"Had to finish it before gta6 will get released after I played years ago 3 quater of the story 
On of rockstars alltime highlights
9510"
I know this game came out in 2013 but still the whole story is just the best start to a story game you can get I would recommend pc gamers to get this its one of the must haves for pc gaming The next gen consoles are also great for this game I just recommend getting this game in general
""
game so good my dad came back with the milk
this game is very fun
immersive and expansive irl playground Everything is focussed on making money though and if Shark Cards werent a thing Im sure the game woul dbe a much more community oriented FAIR challenge On some gang war shit
i am just a dumb guy with a day job it makes me agree to some putrid terms of service and log into a web site every time i care to play this game i paid for and if i forget my password i can click the web site button then check my email but no link has arrived obviously it is my fault im sure i forgot how i signed up for my rockstar games web site account heck with it i will find something else to do
BIG CAR VROOM BIG BIG GUN BOOM
So I wont lie if you wanna have fun in gta online in 2024 and are starting FRESH get a modded account like I did in 2023 Worth every penny Game is fun just a lot of modders on pc Griefing is an issue but you can just join another session or grief back when you have unlimited cash
pretty cool game

A few years ago I bought a desktop that meet the minimum requirements of the game but the game was basically unplayable I waited for a few years and now I have a computer that could comfortably play the game but I am locked out of single player because I forgot the email i used to play the game for an hour 3 years ago This game sucks im going to unadd this game and just pirate it if its the only way Im allowed to play the game

Lol who the f wouldnt recommend this game Its GTA FAM
"Im very late to the party The game is old and everybody has played it or at least Id assume they did I picked the game up for 10 on a sale and decided to play it through since I never got around to it Before I began the hype around GTA 6 was ablaze on the internet and I didnt understand all these people saying that they want to play it right now Its a game you can wait its going to be just fine and nothing that will change your life

But about GTA 5 when I started I quickly settled into it I didnt care about online or most of the sidesidecontent I did do some sidequests because they were all interesting enough and distinct enough that going through them was enjoyable And the story even for sidequests was interesting I have not skipped a single cut scene because I was in awe of the motion capture Its not that it looks real life or anything but the model for it is so well done you feel these people moving talking and thinking You easily bond with basically anybody because their face expressions are believable And besides most of the best parts of this game happen in cars where youre just driving down some highway listening to your station and people are talking Sometimes Id slow down just to make sure that I got to listen to everything that they had to say because the dialog is quick snappy people dont wait for others to finish this monologue  mostly  to start talking And the stuff they talk about is always something you can somewhat connect to Well not always about being a murderer but for example you can somewhat feel how Micheal is feeling even though he is a murderer that faced no consequences and is living in a mansion doing nothing Each of the characters are distinct and interesting and everyone is placed in a spot where you see that they dont want to go back doing what they were doing but at the same time you see that continuing doing what they currently pursue is destroying their relationship with others Not Trevor really but thats beside the point

The place where the game has its thing down is driving each car is different and you quickly learn which ones to pick on the street Because of the fact that driving is so interesting and feels so complex it feels okay to be placed in those situations where you have to drive from point A to point B At first In the last quarter of this game driving becomes really tedious But it does not affect the game too much to become a big problem and the radio stations are great so you can just enjoy the music But to be honest it sometimes also depends When you have the vibe enabling the first person perspective and obeying all the traffic laws while driving is really relaxing But doing it for too long can expose the limitation in the AI of the characters that are just runningdriving around the city

The story is flesh out really well Everybody gets their introduction and ending  maybe expect Stretch this character is a part in the ending but you only play one mission with him Everything comes around in a nice circle where every character is introduced they play their part and most likely theyre dead at the end Killing off people is paced well and people that you are rooting for to be killed are written in a way to make you hate them That way once you finally get them it feels right but at the same time it feels like these people are over the top but maybe not really once you start to unpeel the layers that make up these characters  Devin and Steve Haines But not to make it out to be something better than it really is the story is just good It is strong and the characters are likeable but not something where you are DEEPLY invested in them It is just there to serve its purpose and to cover the fact that the game is mostly about shooting other people

The game is long interesting simple and fun Now I know why people want to play GTA 6 already Because its most likely going to be really fun"

VERY WORTH IT
driving and music is the best combo in this game

"Grand Theft Auto V is that sandbox open world experience that keeps you busy for 200 hours in single player or 500 hours or more in multiplayer  

In single player mode youll find a long and beautiful campaign with over 70 main missions and 3 endingsthat alone is going to take over 30 hours if you rush it but i advise to enjoy and explore everything because its worth

The strangers and freaksthe side missions and side activities represent a huge chunk of the game its amazing how much details and work they put into these

There is also the multiplayerwhich received along the years manny content updates I dare say theres more content in GTA Online and if youre afraid of cheaters you can create a session only for you and play it alone without some features but enough to finish almost everything by yourself

Pros

Amazing story with great voice actinghuge amount of content
Multiplayer receive content updates even after 9 years

Cons

sometimes in multiplayer its best to create a only friend invite session to avoid cheaters 

My review score

Story    10 
Gameplay 9
Graphics 8
Music     9 

Overall  9"
nice game for ceto king

Yeah so uh love the story mode played it on Xbox and now on PC modded with a few things to make it look better Hate online and when I say HATE I MEAN HATE Online is just horrible Its still filled with exploiters toxic people and a WHOLE lot of stuff that doesnt make any sense like flying cars and bikes Also a freaking laser gun _ I genuinely wish they would remove all of these OP vehicles and just make it like Story mode where your options are Tank Helicopter or Jet Not to mention the PTW with the shark cards dont even get me started on that Deserves a solid 4 4 stars goes to the Story mode 0 to Online

"Since there are already about a million different reviews of GTA V with the consensus being that its great Ive decided to forgo adding another generic review in praise of it Instead Ill review GTA Online as it stands in January 2024b Im marking this review as Recommended but that is entirely based on GTA V my opinions on GTA V and GTA Online are completely different bia big shocker I knowi 
 
Since its launch in 2013 GTA Online has undergone several changes aimed at nudging players toward purchasing ingame currency with real money The everincreasing prices of items vehicles and properties with each game update are a push to boost the parent companys quarterly earnings rather than the parody of realworld inflation one might expect from Rockstar Games 

Online play does have its bright spots with some interesting new missions Unfortunately many of them are locked behind expensive properties purchased with ingame currency and offer little to no replayability Lack of replayability may seem ironic in a game that can be categorized as grindcentric but one gets the impression that this is intentional or perhaps Im wrong and its just plain laziness on the part of the developers 

There is one significant negative that I havent touched on yet and that is the community more specifically the modders I completely avoided joining public lobbies in my playing experience because the game is so infested with these individuals that its almost impossible not to encounter some I understand that not all of these people have malicious intentions but enough do that its worth avoiding the risk and when I say risk I mean itthe capabilities of some of these mod clients are binsaneb 

Overall GTA Online has its moments but the experience is diminished by things such as paywalls specifically property missions and modders and I wouldnt recommend wasting your time on it

bTLDR GTA V  Good GTA Online  Badb"

I reinstalled it last Week and out of 50 lobbys i havent found a single one without modders

its very fun but online is broken to many hackers do I would reccomend but if you want to do online you really cant
All in all I do like the game itself But as far as online multiplayer goes Ive encountered one too many cheaters hackers and trolls The reason Im saying Not Recommended isnt because the game is bad The game all in itself is good The problem is the PLAYERS Im saying Not Recommended because of how many players out there who choose to be bad sports I still like this game and I still play it all the time You can too if you want BUT PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK

"Good evening fellow Steam players I am Dong Dong a professional athlete and gamer for the Chinese peoples republic and I am writing this review about the game Grand Theft Auto V on platforms such as Steam PlayStation 5 and Xbox One

This game resonates with me deeply I have the freedom to do whatever I want in this beautiful masterpiece of a game crafted by Rockstar Games Ive been playing this game a bit recently it has helped me to cope with the loss of my familys Tibetan hound Zonqinp Zon was a positive influence in our household and it is sad to see him go but thankfully I can pretend like he and his fellow deceased hounds Qongchang and Seebodi are with me in this digital experience

Allinall this game is all I have ever wanted in a gaming experience I recommend you to buy this masterpiece Waiting for GTA 6 as well Dong Dong signing off"

"My Rockstar account got hacked and Ive been trying to contact them about it for days I get the same default response asking for certain info every time I send it to them and they reply with the SAME EMAIL asking for my information

 At one point they told me my ticket got updated and that I needed to log in to see the update I CANT LOG IN my account got stolen someone changed the email so I cant reset the password Make sure to use two factor and change your password regularly because if you get locked out youre not getting any help from Rockstar with the issue Just some bot sending the same message over and over again Good luck"
I like the game overall but the main setback is how the people ruin the game But other than the players the games amazing
good game especially if youre getting carried by some no lifers in online
"Incredible Game Really recomend it for everyone Great Story mode Fun to play around on Online mode
tons of missions ways to get money and super fun to play with friends Really recomend it with its value
Really recomend Buying Grand Theft Auto V"
the Best game ever
lobes this game very fun to play and meet people
The overall game is good but Rockstar needs to stop constantly nerfing every way to get money in online Pretty much every good way to get money has been cut down by like 50 Why dont you try to fix the glitches instead Rockstar Or maybe listen to what people want

i stabbed a hooker
"Here is a Ukrainian Garlic Bread recipe

For the dough

1 cup milk 250 ml
2 14 teaspoons active dry yeast 1 packet
2 Tablespoons sugar
2 Tablespoons oil sunflower avocado or olive
3 cups allpurpose flour 380 g
2 teaspoons salt
1 egg beaten
For the garlic oil
3 Tablespoons oil sunflower avocado or olive
34 garlic cloves
1 Tablespoon chopped fresh dill
1 Tablespoon chopped fresh Italian parsley
flake salt optional

INSTRUCTIONS
 
For the dough warm the milk until it is between 80100 degrees F  just warm to the touch Add the milk to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment or to a large bowl if kneading by hand Add the sugar to the milk then sprinkle the yeast on top Whisk the mixture and allow it to activate and become foamy for about 510 minutes
Once the yeast is activated add the oil to the milk mixture then add the flour and salt If using a stand mixer start mixing the dough on the lowest setting Once the dough starts to form a ball increase the speed to medium and knead for 68 minutes Alternatively knead for 1012 minutes by hand The dough is done when it is elastic glossy soft and easily comes away from the sides of the bowlsurface
Add the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a clean damp kitchen towel Let the dough rise for 11 12 hours or until doubled in size
Once the dough has risen and doubled in size punch it down to remove the air and transfer it to a clean surface Form the dough into a rectangle and then divide it into 8 equalsized pieces weigh each one to be exact Form each piece into a ball by pinching the edges inward and then on a flat surface roll the dough into a ball shape
Preheat the oven to 350 F Lightly grease a 9inch round or square baking dish preferably metal as opposed to glass or ceramic Beat the egg for the egg wash Place each ball of dough in the baking dish with an equal distance between each ball Allow the dough to rise a second time for 30 minutes or until the rolls have puffed up and filled the pan
Brush the tops of the dough with the egg wash and bake for 2530 minutes or until deep golden brown
While the rolls bake make the garlic oil mixture Finely mince the garlic then combine it with the oil chopped dill and chopped parsley Brush the garlicherb mixture over the rolls immediately after they come out of the oven Allow the rolls to cool for 15 minutes before serving Pampushky can also be served at room temperature or reheated"
the online is full of nothing but hachers and griefers good luck playing this game
Good game I think I missed some help prompts or something because swimming and flying on the pc are a bit strange on the default controls leftshirt leftctrl numpad and in combination with the awsd and using my mouse to fix the camera view every now and then is a bit weird by default but I wanted to try this using default settings
UY
Most of the fun I had with this game was just running people over 810

Essa jogo tem uma história muito boa muitas pessoas jogam pela mecânica mas quando paramos para analisar a história aborda escolhas entre uma balança composta por família amigos dinheiro Esse jogo nos passa a ideia de que temos que ter responsabilidade sobre certas situações entendo o Michael trair seus parceiros de roubo por conta da família

Servers are trash game keeps crashing modders are rampant and god forbid rockstar decides to make dedicated servers dont waste your money
j
BS game full of hackers and modders R doesnt give a fk problems when starting the game lots of bugs after 12 years Weak company 0 quality not recommanded New version not available on PC Hackers can easily hack your PC if u not careful Mission rewards nerfed to 0 to force you buy shark cards Hackers provide billions for much less money than R  achivranketc xD Should be ereased from the shop its a trash Multibillion company my a xDxD Follow the example  of BG3 when choosing games and never settle for less R another company which follows profit and nothing more seems like bad management 2 me If u gonna play it do as everyone else and just mode trough the game xD
this game is very very good I bought it because this game uhh I cant explain it for rockstar thank you
yes
"Good to have a Game like this to experience the sort of thing that we cant do in the real world
Great Game"

modders rule the lobbies the online has become a ghetto version of the sims and half of the opportunities that make the game appealing with dlcs are negated by the toxicity of modders what you think you are getting is not actually what you are getting if you dont plan on giving yourself everything of the get go with mods dont even bother to play the way rockstar projects this game to be
there is a topless npc in the game
my pc exploded 
rah
its a amazing game and one of the best
i have lost my gogle account and now i cant remeber my password or change it

"Story is amazing 

Had a great time playing the game over the years with my friends in GTA Online 

But it has become stale recently since Rockstar stopped dropping massive updates for online 

I recommend this game but its time for it to die as its been out enough"

i hope gta 6 will do better but i highly doubt it"

This is the most toxic game I have ever played Full with trolls that are 500 levels ahead of you and probably paid for ingame currency only to kill you on first sight The worst spent money in my life The only place you can chill is in separateworld missions which get pretty boring after some hours Fuck rockstar __

Thumbs down Great game but I Paid for the criminal enterprise and shark card bundle of gta told to wait 2448 hours for it to come through Followed the bullshit rockstar asked me to do uploading videos and receipts etc pushing 60 hours now nothing showing and rockstar not getting back to me About to refund this shit Playing since the day of release on numerous consoles and just got it from steam and its not working If its not fixed by tomorrow Im refunding the fuck out of this
rockstar give me rdr 2
i love modders now im level 8000 with 50 mil by just afking
yes
op
lemme know if there is a sex update
Filled with cheaters and the online is a loading screen simulator
Grand Theft Auto V the epitome of subtlety and refined storytelling takes you on a journey through the thriving metropolis of Los Santos The game with its profound depth and nuanced characters challenges your intellect at every turn The storyline is a masterclass in profound narrative weaving together the tales of three utterly relatable and notatall clichéd protagonists The satire is so subtle you might miss it if you blink The missions Pure genius Driving across the vast meticulously crafted world is an absolute joy especially when you encounter the aweinspiring traffic AI In summary GTA V is a subtle refined masterpiece oozing with originality
vERY BEST BUT LAGGING LOW

"I would give this game a 5 star however since playing it for a while now reduced it to 3 stars and not recommend it  WHY

Maybe I should start with the positives
1  ACTION packed
2 Myriad of things to do purchases and missions etc
3 Ability to play on or off line onlinestory mode
4 Play together with friends

Lets go with the negatives and my first big one is

1 When you die youre dead right  Well it seems some pansy queers get their panties tied in a knot and dont want to lose  SHAME on RockStar which do things in 24 hour modes like getting through a bounty or breaking into the stash houses but this one thing gets to me 

When these people get shot at or lose against you they tend to chase you down to prove a point  THEY ARE SORE LOSERS and refuse to lose  So they come after you and within the session MURDER you on and on and one  There was one time I could not even get out of my session to go into another  

Another time this play was so close I could touch him and I KNOW I eliminated them and low an behold they didnt even fall and shot me once again  Yeah I would say 5 to 10 hits from the same person during that session24 hour period would be more than enough  SHAME on RockStar

Maybe there should be a limit on how much you can be killed my ONE person during a session  I mean enough is enough and when is too much enough  Its like beating a dead horse at that point  Move on losers and play on  For Christ sake its only a GAME and thats how I look at it  A GAME

2 In the middle of a great win or lose battle you get a network error  REALLY  RockStar has a multi gazillion dollar enterpriseand it happens frequently  Im sure theyll blame that crap on my systemPity on them

3  Little player clicks kick you out because your winning or youre not playing they way they wantcry babies   Actually I dont mind going into other sessions

Yeah these are the negatives and overall will outnumber the positives if you really want to play this game  Im sure you got hackers in there as well  Phantom players recoding etc  

You wold think this companys been around a million years and would clean up some of these issues  I mean I know its a cut throat game but I counted 51 kills on me and I was not even able to change my session but had to ALTCONTROLDELETE to shut the game down

Yeah its like I said its beating a dead horse  Are you dead enough yet

The multi player section is cool if you can find other players  

Yeah play at your own risk

Could be a fun game though"

Hallo Steam Apakah Kamu Bisa Mengembalikan Gta 5 Ku Saya Tidak Sengaja Menekan Hide This Game Dan Saya Tidak Tau Harus Berbuat Apa
"The Grand Theft Auto series is fun Rockstar makes really good games RDR2 being the greatest game of all time However GTA5 Online is riddled with cheatersmodders that they have completely destroyed the game play experience To the point that Im honestly surprised there hasnt been a classaction lawsuit against Rockstar for refusing to fix the issues They have pretty much put patches on the back burner to focus solely on GTA6 They should be sued into oblivion for allowing this to go on If they cant put anything into GTA Online that doesnt generate money they wont do it This includes security patches It should be a criminal offense what they are doing Selling a product without fixing major game breaking issues

Dont waste your time with it"

"Title Los Santos Sinful Playground A Review of GTA 5s Vanilla Unicorn Strip Club

Rating  45

Welcome to the provocative world of the Vanilla Unicorn Los Santos premier strip club and nightlife destination in Grand Theft Auto 5 Brace yourself for a rollercoaster ride of neon lights seductive dancers and an atmosphere thats both tantalizing and controversial

Ambiance
The Vanilla Unicorn boasts a lively and vibrant atmosphere complete with pulsating music colorful lighting and an eclectic mix of patrons The club exudes a sense of decadence capturing the essence of a highend adult entertainment venue The attention to detail is commendable from the smoky ambiance to the realistically rendered poledancing routines

Entertainment
The main attraction of course is the talented lineup of exotic dancers Each performer showcases unique moves and choreography adding variety to the visual spectacle The club also features private dance rooms for a more intimate experience providing players with a taste of the risqué side of Los Santos nightlife While the explicit content is clearly intended for a mature audience the animations and performances are wellexecuted within the context of the game

Interactivity
Players can engage in various activities within the club such as enjoying a drink at the bar playing a game of darts or even partaking in a private dance The interactive elements add depth to the overall experience allowing players to immerse themselves in the virtual nightlife of Los Santos

Controversy
Its essential to acknowledge the controversial nature of the strip club in the game While it serves as a virtual space for adultoriented entertainment some players may find the explicit content uncomfortable or offensive Rockstar Games the developers have aimed to create an authentic depiction of a certain aspect of city life but individual sensitivities may vary

Conclusion
The Vanilla Unicorn is a wellcrafted and immersive addition to GTA 5s openworld experience It successfully captures the allure of a highend strip club providing players with a taste of the glitzy and risqué side of Los Santos nightlife Whether youre there for the mesmerizing dance performances or to explore the interactive elements the Vanilla Unicorn offers a unique slice of digital decadence that contributes to the diverse tapestry of activities in the game Just be mindful of the explicit content if youre easily offended as the club doesnt shy away from its adultoriented theme So step into the neonlit world of the Vanilla Unicorn and let the virtual decadence unfold "

"i decided to purchase the game for PC previously played on console to relive the singleplayer i remembered so fondly

didnt let me play the game i purchased because my social club was registered under the wrong email

no option to switch email or make a new one it insisted i log in with the older email which i no longer had access to and support ran me in circles for multiple days before outright not solving my issue meaning i was stuck with a piece of bloatware i couldnt play it wouldnt even launch without the login im sure there was a third party way of getting around it but i instead opted to refund the game through steam saved me a whole lot more headache

to be clear this didnt simply lock me out of GTA online or participating in multiplayer content this login locked me out of the base gameplay the singleplayer storyline that i PAID for

dogshit company dont support them"

great ass game lmao
good game
Would be a great game without that Rockstar social login cancer You buy the game on steam you pay for it then if whatever happens to your rockstar social login that you did not ask for and did not know prior to buying the game you cannot play the game anymore as your steam profile gets linked to that particular rockstar social login that you did not want or paid for you as a retard thought you were paying for the game but Rockstar does not care Anyway one day you reinstall the game thinking you can replay it well your steam profile got linked to that initial rockstar login so if you cant access it then bad luck you cant play the game Can you unlink that rockstar login cancer from steam No you cant Did rockstar get your money It sure did Just do yourself a favor and dont buy it anymore If the social login cancer returns in GTA6 just dont buy that either
I switched from playstation to PC and my first lobby that I joined within the first 10 minutes of playing a modder trapped me in a gun store and started spawning money and giving me rp In less then a minute i went from level 1 to level 25 with an extra 100k

1 word modders
everybody should have this game
I can no longer recommend this game or at least the online part anyway The campaign is amazing but I literally cant get through 5 minutes of playing online before modders glitch the crap out of the game and make it impossible to play
rockstar has completely abandoned the pc version of the game it is nothing but modders modders and modders they can make the screen flash and cause seizures as my daughter has found out i do not recommend paying for this game far better games out there that actually ban modders gta is not that game and rockstar is not that company
However GTA Online is filled with hacked players  I really wish rockstar would address this major issue

"I dont recommend this game after 1000 hours because of Rockstars insistence on lowering the quality of their product GTA 5 is a great game no real complaints there GTA Online was great as of 2020 Since then theyve done everything they can to timegate progression thru lower payouts and by removal of roughly 180 vehicles Said vehicles can still be accessed with GTA  their new premium service Two problems with this being one it costs a monthly fee and two its not out for PC Also trying to play in a public session without modders is almost impossible Rockstar knows about these cheaters theyve been in the game since release and little has been done about it However if there is a money exploit theyre quick to patch it out If you encounter an issue online and need help good luck getting a hold of customer service theyve ripped their phones from the wall Now you can message them and hope you get someone competent Honestly with their recent performance I expect GTA 6 to be more of the same

TLDR This game gets a 410 for quality control issues Rockstar prioritizes monetization of the community"

"Good game if you have friends alright game solo

If you play with friends you will most likely have a great time There is enough stuff to do that someone in your group will make the dumbest mistake in a heist or will spend 5 million on a vehicle that is terrible just to be bullied for it
Yes the online can be very grindy at times and you might run into a fair few modders But my experience with modders has been mostly fun with them doing random stuff with the lobby to have a laugh only 2 or 3 where in it to ruin the game for others 

Story is very nice I enjoyed it"
VERY GOOD
this is it boys the year before gta 6
The Game Is So GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
"Hackers 0 anti cheat buy on Xbox or PS if you intend to play online at all

This game is a ton of fun  The single player campaign is really good and the open world keeps being interesting  Playing with your friends is a blast but the open multiplayer lobbies are hit and miss you will commonly see maxedout griefers exploiters and straightup cheaters
such an amazing game  with endless play always something to do

If you love playing with modders this is the game for you Every lobby is these little twig bois trying to show off how good their mods are Rockstar does literally nothing to stop it Good luck paying for GTA6 and getting the shame lame shit
Amazing game graphics top notch the story is amazing Although the story is a bit short compared to other Grand Theft Auto the amount of detail put into the story is insane The game is worth buying
still fun after all these years
Absolutely worth it Im 250 hours into online and have just scratched the surface Havent even started story mode which is a whole other thing Every minute is fun always something to do Recommend strongly
peepeepoopoo

Singleplayer und GTAOnline allein bieten echt schon unglaublich viel Content der bock macht Die Story zu spielen lohnt sich meiner Meinung nach sehr Online in öffentlichen Lobbys zu spielen ist ein absolutes Shtfest spielt lieber in Lobbys mit FreundInnen Mit Mods FiveM und RageMP auf jeden Fall eine der aktivsten Moddingcommunitys die es gibt

"One quote to review this game 
I said something nice not something expensive  Trevor
55 actual banger sad i slept on this game for so long"
Cashgrab only good for mods imo try LSPDFR  THE ULTIMATE POLICE SIM
San andreas was the Best gta this doesnt come close I got this game for the 3rd time tho rockstar are very undeserving of that I got this  for the mods To many trainee apprentices doing all the work at half the wages while rockstar CEOs pocket all the money my biggest issues are the  Running and the movement of the Player its all restricted and slow and the shooting is meh and the map doesnt have the freedom feeling and sense of journey that san andreas had but its still an OK game 710
never buy this game from the people playing it to the devs that run it this is a abomination not only by man but by all life yes im waiting for GTAVI to drop stfu

gta 5 is such a classic who actually hates this game
perfect game  will recommend to everyone
Didnt realize I have spent too much time playing the game Enjoying it very much
"Very buggy on pc and Rockstar glazes the console version of this game Heists bug out and kicks everyone youre playing with out of the lobby For example on The Cayo Perico heist when youre trying to use the key cards on doors your character will just stand there and do nothing Other times guards will catch you even though you havent killed anybody and youre out of sight Sometimes when you take the primary target it wont count and it wont be added to your payout 

If youre two people playing the Diamond Casino heist and you reach the tunnel before the vault the game will kick both you and the other player out of the session These are issues theyve had for a while but theyve never bothered to fix it Theyre a half assed staff who dont care as much for pc compared to Playstation and Xbox Some people experience different bugs than what my friends and i have but it still bothers me that these are common issues and they dont care to fix it I understand they are working on gta 6 but still

Mind you ive played over 300 hours on the ps4 and ps5 version of the game and ive never experienced a bug whatsoever"
very good
great game
What I like about the game is that when you start you can go to the R mission at the top of the map and there are a series of missions The guys name is Dax and if you complete all 6 of his easy missions you get 500 grand great starting tip for new online players
10
highly recommend
Just play the story mode NEVER start online
man i buy gta v but to mothe ago say buy agin why man for what
wish rockstar would stop taking shit away and nerfing s h i t but all in all fun game especially when you have friends to play with
i cant play gta 5 beacause of error
Fun

"I play GTA solely for the storytelling aspect However the story ends quite abruptly like they just ran out of budget and decided to cut it short The last score is a letdown its just another heist but with a bigger cut The final antagonists you have to kill are pretty forgettable The map is big but feels empty especially outside of the city Its a step down from GTA IV in term of story R also never released a single DLC for singleplayer a decade later which is very telling about their priorities

For R standard this would be considered a negative review"

"Unfortunately GTA Online has killed by cheaters and lack of balance 
Cant complete single mission in this game When Im trying to complete mission someone on a flying bike  with rocket launcher on it  just destroying me and im surely losing 
Dear Rockstar Games how do you want me to fight with that when i have only 10 level and just basic weapons 
Im happy that people donated you to get this stuff but what about balance Excuse me I just joined the game I cant do nothing with people on a fighterbombers and invulnerable cars Of course thats a competition in the game but that should be at least a little balanced 
I wanted to play GTA Online so much but after 63 hours in this game all what I can say  a huge dissapointment"

I loaded into the game and within the first 2 hours of GTA Online I was given every trophy so I couldnt have fun through getting them legitly This also blocked me from getting the call from simeon therefore not being able to buy anything
experience is good
"Pros
Great story

realistic map and highway exits and ramps
heists are the raids of this game

cons
online economy inflation
can be a grind fest if youre focused on getting bread

"Grand Theft Auto V is an extraordinary openworld actionadventure game that offers an immersive and thrilling experience From the moment you step into the fictional city of Los Santos youre greeted with a living breathing world filled with endless possibilities

The games storyline follows three protagonists each with their own unique backgrounds and personalities which adds depth and variety to the gameplay Youll get to know Michael a retired bank robber trying to live a peaceful life Franklin a young hustler looking for his big break and Trevor a volatile and unpredictable character

One of the standout features of GTA 5 is its vast and dynamic open world Los Santos feels alive teeming with pedestrians bustling traffic and a variety of activities to engage in Whether you want to participate in highspeed police chases engage in thrilling heists or simply explore the citys stunning landscapes theres always something to keep you entertained

The games attention to detail is remarkable The graphics are stunning with incredibly realistic visuals that bring the city and its inhabitants to life The level of immersion is further enhanced by a phenomenal soundtrack which features a wide range of genres and perfectly complements the fastpaced gameplay

GTA 5 also introduces an online multiplayer mode called GTA Online where you can team up with friends or other players from around the world to tackle missions participate in races or just wreak havoc together in the city This adds a whole new dimension to the game providing endless hours of fun and excitement

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece in the gaming world It combines a gripping storyline a massive open world stunning visuals and an online multiplayer mode that keeps you engaged for hours on end Whether youre a fan of the series or new to the franchise GTA 5 is a mustplay for any gamer seeking an adrenalinepumping experience"

Absolutely awful if you want to play with friends Every time you enter a mission with friends you get thrown into lobbies with randoms and not able to connect with friends even though you all enter at the exact same time Cant even invite them to missions  They managed to take GTA and sucked all the fun out of it

this game is very fun and gooood i forgot i have it for 2 years lol
good
Game still looks good in 2024 I am glad they never stopped updating the online content of the game I just wished though that they have added more single player content and story I think that would have been awesome including the mystery in Mt Chilliad UFOs coming to life as if there is an invasion More gangrelated stories for Franklin Coming of old Los Santos characters such as CJ Tenpenny etc
its fun

good
lol
There are so many hackers on here now the game is no longer fun It used to be just every once in a while and they would just do goofy stuff now they are just causing issues for all other players and can remove you from the sessions I know the new GTA is going to come out soon but if they are still trying to make money off this  one they should at least be policing it
nivyg
they banned me even though i did not do anything wrong
If your reading this go in story mode and use code TOOLUP for and RPG AK47 Handgun Sniper rifle Grenades and a submachine gun and if your run out of amo reuse the code for more ammo
Not much to say we all know it one of the best
Go in private lobby to avoid all the toxic players and cheaters especially on PC
""
its good
its almost impossible to make money if you dont have a 4 man crew if you dont have a 4th person to play with you then its not fun at all because you cant do heist it just makes everything so hard kinda sucks that its that way bc the game is super fun if and when you have money i have a buisness that makes you alot of money but you have to have alot of money to start and upgrade it ive have played the game for 12 hours since i bought the business and its less than  a quarter if the way till i can sell my product other than that the game is so amazing if you have 3 other friends to play it with

Game is crawling with God ModeNoRagdoll losers abusing mod menus Rockstar doesnt give a shit Game can still be fun at times and youll often find chill people playing but for the most part the game is full of trolls abusing god mode trying to make the GTA Online experience as miserable as possible for legitimate players As if trying to make money legit in this game wasnt tedious enough enjoy getting harassed by losers on power trips at the same time
Really good story and really good to play with friends sucks that thier are a bunch of toxic and hacker people on online mode but other than that its really fun
sfbsvsbdvedvdsvewefewveswa
You dont need any review to know just how awesome retro and unique this game is I love Rockstar and their masterpiece games
"At this point youve probably played the story mode of GTAV so youre looking at maybe GTA Online or something

It is 100 not worth it Rockstar has specifically designed it to be an incredible time and moneysink Their lackluster anticheat systems mean legitimate players trying to play the game are outnumbered by bots instantly killing players from all over the map

"Grand Theft Auto 5 stylized as Grand Theft Auto V is the 15th overall installment and 5th installment of the main series of games known as Grand Theft Auto a thirdperson shooter game set in the fictional version of Los Angeles known as Los Santos dveloped by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games The game follows 3 main protagonists Michael De Santa a film buff and former bank robber in witness protection who following a series of events must come out of retirement Trevor Philips an old friend and crew member of Michaels who must finds out his old friend never actually died during their final heist which went wrong and Franklin Clinton a smalltime street gangster whom Michael takes under his wing and mentors into being a better criminal

Grand Theft Auto Vs story is full of great characters a great story itself and very memorable moments Aside from that is the aptly titled Grand Theft Auto Online which offers an experience great for friends and parties just dont hang around freemode or expect a rocket to the face"

ITS SUPER GOOD
To this date GTA V is still simply the best
fucking server loading
The game is good but there is a problem with the online session there is alot of modders wandering in the session making the game freeze
I am a 45 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father raising my son who is now 14 years old My son won this game from his uncle so we installed him on his computer and he started playing Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game This was horrible for me because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him I bought the game chose my skin and world and started playing but I was stuck in what you should do I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate I loved it because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died Since then this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well This game reminded me that there is fun in everything and I brought many happy memories to me and my son
awesome

"Great game for interactive open world experience Crossplay is a NO big sad multiplayer game in this modern world with to ability for PC players to play with Console players 

Rockstar please consider catering to the community of your player base  

PLEASE ADD CROSS PLAY TO PCPS4XBOX before releasing GTA 6 or slightly after 

Much love for the hours enjoyed StalinFX"

Smd Rockstar Stories great but online has become a complete shit hole Join a pub lobby and prepare to be Ddosd by a modder flying a UFO tracing IPs and locking people in cages Also Rockstar has a tendancy to ban random accounts and then ignore unban requests

You know if your buying this you either have nothing to do with your life or you were born in 2008  2016 then your probably playing the infamous GTA Online if you have found yourself in this dark place in your life please seek help for this is a dark path to fall down it is a spiral down a infinite staircase and it is a ugly trip that you cant stay home for and the thing about this is if you quit you will just return to satisfy your addiction to purchase everything and grind to your burial 800 2738255

I love the game it is fun as hell You can get really mods for free It make the game even more fun If you play the on online mode you well have a lot of fun you might make fends but there might be a modern I love this game so much
why the fuck are there so many random crashes
i think this is a wonderful game cant wait to play gta 6
"story mode  what do you expect from rockstar 
online mode grind money grind money grind money buy a  cool car worth all you grinding grind money grind money and repeats 
if you wanna play the online i dont recommend it without friends its a great game when you have friends to play with  one of my best gaming era was gta online making story films with in game editor canceled because of a stupid  in grope fight hanging out in lobbies killing each other playing the heist and races
ah good old day i miss it"
Single player is good Just beware of the janky online mode
Its awesome Great graphics and stuff
g
super gooddddddddddddddddd
Hope you dont get exploded within 5sec of joining an Online Session
good game would recomend
Normally i would recommend this game but after my recent game plays in online half of the servers are filled with modders that kill you and troll you but on the other hand if your playing story mode its not that bad the story has a nice lure and got great graphics which means that you need a more upgraded PC to play it
fun

Best game ive ever played
honestly cant go wrong buying it playing solo is kinda painfull becuase earning money is impossible because of cayo nerf if u just want to fly around in cool cars and planes get kiddions mod menu from unknownCheatscom follow a guide on how to get money its not bannable and it saves you grinding for days and it also can help agianst mk2 nerds becuase there is mod to remove you from the radar try not to interact with modders who are lagging or interacting with the gta world because they will crash ur pc if you so much as breathe on them do be warned game gets very boring after you download a mod menu because you unlock everything sense of pride and progressions is obliterated
I was told this was a Dora the Explorer game

"Online is trash Rockstar keeps making it harder and harder to enjoy the game by removing and altering aspects to make it as grindy and unfair as possible To top it off they do not have the capabilities to fix the hacking infestation that exists on pc 
So if you are not getting murdered by npcs with overpowered aimbot you are getting griefed by a hacker who has never washed their ass

Save yourself the money Rockstar is not the same company it once was when GTAV released"

"GTA V is nothing short of a masterpiece in the world of openworld gaming Rockstar has created an immersive sprawling landscape that captivates players from the very beginning From the intricate storyline to the stunningly detailed Los Santos every aspect of the game is a testament to the developers dedication and craftsmanship

Despite my laptops modest specs the game runs surprisingly well providing a smooth and enjoyable experience The optimization is commendable allowing me to delve into the rich narrative and explore the vast cityscape without sacrificing performance

The characters are brilliantly crafted each with their unique personalities and story arcs that kept me engaged throughout my 12hour gaming session The missions are diverse offering a perfect blend of action strategy and humor The attention to detail is astounding making Los Santos feel like a living breathing city

Whether youre a fan of intense heists adrenalinepumping car chases or simply want to roam a meticulously designed open world GTA V has it all The multiplayer mode adds another layer of excitement providing endless opportunities for collaboration and competition

In summary GTA V is not just a game its an experience Its a testament to Rockstars commitment to delivering topnotch gaming adventures If you havent played it yet youre missing out on one of the greatest gaming experiences of our time

Pros

Incredible openworld design
Engaging storyline and characters
Optimized for a variety of hardware
Diverse and exciting missions
Multiplayer adds extensive replay value
Cons

None worth mentioning
Conclusion
GTA V stands tall as a mustplay title for any gaming enthusiast Rockstar has set the bar high and this game continues to shine as a beacon of excellence in the gaming industry
The game is too good and the online gta is fantastic"

Absolutely shocking decisions by rockstar to force you to have a social club account to even play the story mode Make sure you dont make the same mistake I did of playing ten years ago linking to your steam account and then losing access to the social club account You wont be able to use any rockstar games you purchased on steam and as usual the support by rockstar is complete trash

A moderator flung me he was mean

"Theres a reason this game has held up for 10 years its because Rockstar knows how to craft a world and story like no other The story mode is fantastic it may not be the best story in the franchise but the introduction of multiple protagonists to explore this at the time massive map it was truly an awesome experience
The online is another beast entirely going strong for almost 10 years is impressive The online community is fairly toxic unless you have a friend group That being said it is still pretty fun to load an invite only server and raise your own mayhem"
after u pley a bit its the best but for the long run i still dont know
this game is so good because when i started playing this game i made a friend get it and now he loves it
oh yeah shoot cops and kill the ops also you can get drunk and pass out and end up in a bathroom

"I can say with 564 certainty this game is no longer worth playing My reasons include but are not limited to
 Instead of focusing on removing hackers and improving the Online experience Rockstar seems more keen on inflating costs and deflating profits and of course their insatiable lust for selling Shark Cards The amount of work that needs to be put in to getting the latest business or vehicle is extremely absurd and overinflated You spend millions of in game dollars on a business that demands irl days worth of time dumped into it to turn a profit and why does a mid SUV cost more than a literal super car
 Content disparity between current gen consoles and PC baffles me Its one thing to have a game exclusively on one platform or console but when the same game is missing features that you can only get on another platform I am curious to their reasoning but so far my moneys on incompetence of their own code One of my friends recently had to stop playing the game due to it bluescreening after about an hour of play since the Christmas update He figured it was due to some sort of graphical overload due to the snow but after the snow left the bluescreening stayed 
 The constant disappointment that comes from features being added and never failing to come up short is a thing to behold Firstperson GTA is something mostall players of the series have wanted for a very long time Rockstar adds it and the FOV is abyssal Of course mods can fix this glaring issue but you have a very good chance of triggering their anticheat and getting your account nuked Towtrucks have been in the game since launch and after 10 years they FINALLY added them Buuuuut its locked behind a business and it can only be used on mission specific vehicles 
 While its nice the interaction menu got a facelift recently its still clunky to navigate through That and while the controls felt good back when the game launched are in desperate need of an overhaul Mapping the functions of running interacting and answering your phone has lead to many instances of death failure and general annoyance God forbid its not an unskippable phone call I dont care if you need your shoes or want a pizza Im in the middle of a literal war right now Text me 
 Lastly there is no Michael content for GTA Online making it highly likely the Kill Michael option is the canon ending to GTA 5s story There are plenty of places where Michael could have been the guy instead of this deluge of onedimensional quippy tropey uninspired characters that feel tacked on instead of interwoven Instead of collaborating with Ned Luke Michaels actor for the 10th Anniversary of GTA 5 they just added a business Meanwhile Ned is doing a play through of GTA 5 on his YT channel I highly recommend checking it out sometime
TLDR Rockstar is greedy incompetent disappointing lazy Justice for Michael Modders ruined the game but at this point I hope they win Fuck you Rockstar see you in Vice City"

For me GTA V is an absolute mustplay game before you die The singleplayer is a wonderful story that really makes you feel for these folks However the fact we never got singleplayer DLCs is criminal eh Hah He he But seriously beat the missions and do the side stuff Youll not regret it 

As for multiplayer its best to play it with friends and that is made far easier now that private lobbies have full progression now Go to Invite Only and go nuts There is a LOT in multiplayer Missions heists businesses legal and illegal and a whole lot more Theres plenty to do in multiplayer that unfortunately completely overshadows singleplayer to an obscene degree That aside its definitely worth playing now that you dont have to play public"

Cool
After 10 years the only problems that get fixed are things that are fun or profitable for people The minor QoL changes and recent updates that just use the same tired formula are just indicative of a corporation trying to extract as much cash for this cow as possible And the loading HFS the LOADING in 2024 Doesnt matter if you are on a SSD you can do 1 mission and be stuck in an infinite loading screen And then theres the actually unplayable content so full of glitches that the most interesting part becomes Wow I didnt know it could mess up like that

Timeless masterpiece
"Trash mechanics You may argue that its a 10 year old game but Halo CE original is 15 years old and the game has superb aiming and vehicle mechanics GTA has slow sloppy and has relativity unresponsive controls understanding the basic physics of GTA youll find that most things dont even follow those simple game physics some tree you can run over no problem some are invincible the invincible trees have an unrealistic hit box and making the smallest branch or a leaf an indestructible monster genuinely makes no sense how a triple A game company makes so many contradictions in their own game the movement is trash as wall trying to turn your character 90 degrees will make them run in a circle 5 times while running into every wall possible seems the controls are purposefully delayed and sporadic for a worse experience

its easier to talk to a special needs kid than it is to play this game"
great game
yes
i love doing the cayo perico heist and then after beeing done with the heist i wil most likely run or fly straight to the strip club where the following steps happen 1 go up to the body guard and knock him out 2 go in and have a few shots 3 blow all my money to get the digits from the workers 
i mean its gta5
fuck
I absolutely love it So many fun heists and mission to do and I love just free roaming and having a good time with other players But the one thing i dont like is the amount of annoying players in the game that just go around shooting and killing people but I guess you cant control that
Gta é gta mas a versão online do Pc está tomado por Modders Não há chances de jogar em servidor público sem haver ao menos um player explodindo a sessão inteira Sinto que a Rockstar já abandonou faz tempo

"I kind of think I wasted my money a bit the graphics seem artificially capped on this PC port with the game looking better on my Xbox 360 from 15 years ago when you open it through steam it asks you to provide personal information to a third party service rockstar social club which I found creepy as hell

The first game I had online was fun there were normal people and it was about what I expected the next day I played I was having a terrible time being chased from hospital to hospital by guys with tanks or weird ass laser miniguns and jetpacks depending on the session and when I would leave the session I would get a bad sport message I get the feeling there were bots to keep me playing and my personal experience wasnt great

Overall it feels like it jumped the shark if you like wild and wacky shit you might like it if you want the story just buy an old console version"
dont play online unless you have a mod menu or youll hate yourself
very good game to say the least 
Very good game loved since childhood lowriders is cool

Great Game to Mod the required Social Club is very annoying as it will forget the BS password it made you set at random intervals then make you create some insane secure password that you can never remember because you never use it and of course the auto fill for the silly worthless password in Google wont copy in game my damn PC knows the password but Rockstar disables the feature as some stupid copy protection  This is a STEAM game I PAID for it created your WORTHLESS account stop requiring a fresh login to a service I never use
Best game you can ever buy
best game

"its gtav what can i say
most fun with some good mods"
"game is good
online makes you get hacks to deal with the hacks
otherwise you cant have any peace in online mode everyone is a hacker like 810 of them so you and one other will be complaining while the rest are like whaaat on pc no way when yeah i dont think people theses days understand how shitty hackers really are"
This game actually taught me ethical lessons haha
Great game

grand theft auto has been such a good experience and i have enjoyed playing it with friends and other but the only thing i have that i kinda dont like is all the modders but other then that its a amazing game and i do recommend it for others to play

For mine 135 hours playing this game i feel the need to come here and say that this game is perfect The game has fast and slow cars and that are very customization able Houses and penthouses are nice and you can customize them to There are missions and heist Guns that you can upgrade and make them have diffrent colors ECT There are places your able to go inside of You can buy night clubs counterfeit money places cocaine place weed farm were you can get supplys and then sell them for money Over all this game is very gun and unique in its own way
fun

Absolutely absurd that they labeled PC as last gen and dropped the game on here PC literally invented ray tracing but no the devs abandoned it and moved to stupid console development only Even GTA 6 wont be on PC at launch Hope rockstar enjoys how horrible they are making their company look

"Do not buy shark cards to support GTA 6 Rockstar has 22b they can pay for it themselves first

Never spent any money on shark cards but the storys amazing and onlines a dumpster fire and only fun in invite only lobbies"
"Honestly I was in love with GTA Vice City Back around 2004 it was my favorite game and I still retain warm memories of playing it Vice City seemed to have been bustling with activities and you could always find something to do

GTA5 A whole nother story for me Dont get me wrong the story itself is rather good But it offers nothing else besides it It doesnt give you  or does a very poor job of pointing at  interesting and meaningful side activities I found nothing interested to do apart from doing the main story Im not interested in yoga and tennis I want to explore the city find interesting stuff while Im doing it and experience interesting game mechanics Most of it seem to be in the story I personally didnt find the same enjoyment and diversity I saw in Vice City In fact it seems like a lot of features from Vice City were either not present in GTA V or rearranged turning them into optional and utterly boring side activity 

Another gripe for me was Online Im not interested in GTA Online but its still included with the main game I guess no point complaining about this since removing it is unlikely to massively change the disk size

All in all if you liked GTA only for the story then feel free to buy it with a discount If you want something more for your experience then youd rather play the Witcher 3 or Red Dead Redemption 2 Especially the latter It has all the vibes of GTA but with more diversity more gameplay more fun more side activities its just much much better 

Hopefully Rockstar takes RDR2 experience into consideration for GTA6"
Ive always liked this game
i like vanilla

"The game is quite interesting as a concept free world but badly executed and is example of how world should not look like
Let me give you examples
 There is too much unnecessery cursing It is just annoying to say the least Yes there could be some from time to time but this is just too much 
 Crime is glorified and really it should not be It would be better for main characters to fight crime not cause it 
 There is no point for Russian language and culture to be part of the game as the game is made in America 
 Too less legal activities opening business and managing it be part of striving for success

I dont think this game is suitable for anyone because it makes you do innapropriote things in worst way possible 
And it is not suitable for younger people especially not to make impression that world consists only of crime

Yes  you may say  well this is game and in game you should do something that you would not do in real life but this is too much violence There are also legal and interesting things to explore that you would not do in real life Like building a software company or something 

I hope that GTA 6 would be at least a bit better because this is dissapointment to be honest"

GTA V is a very fun game I am visually impaired and while some parts are more difficult than others I usually find a solution I love the mods that the community makes especially since some of them greatly help me with inavvessible sections Trust me and buy the game
I love GTA
"Achievements
GTA V offers a diverse range of achievements that cater to both casual players and completionists Some are straightforward and easy to unlock while others require skill strategy and persistence Whether youre stealing your first car or completing a complex heist the achievement system keeps you engaged and motivated Its satisfying to see that 100 completion mark next to your profile and the variety of challenges ensures that theres something for everyone

Story Mode
The heart of GTA V lies in its captivating story mode Rockstar Games has crafted an intricate narrative with memorable characters unexpected twists and a sprawling openworld environment As you switch between the three protagonistsMichael Franklin and Trevoryoull experience a rollercoaster of emotions from highstakes heists to personal struggles The attention to detail voice acting and cinematic cutscenes make this one of the most immersive singleplayer experiences in gaming history

Online Mode
GTA Online takes the game beyond the story mode allowing you to explore Los Santos with friends or other players worldwide Whether youre racing participating in elaborate heists or simply causing chaos the online world is a dynamic playground Customizing your character buying properties and competing in various activities add depth and longevity to the game Plus the regular updates and events keep the community engaged ensuring that theres always something new to discover

Overall Recommendation
In summary GTA V is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends an engaging story mode with a thriving online community Whether youre a fan of intense action exploration or simply want to cruise around the city this game delivers The attention to detail stunning visuals and sheer freedom make it a mustplay title So buckle up grab your virtual weapons and dive into the chaotic world of GTA Vits an adventure you wont regret"
great game
I LIKET
"I love this game some much I must have played it about more than 100 hrs
Just started playing the game again after 3 years PS3 and 4 away and its just as good as I remember HOWEVER I paid 10 for steam plus just to play online and what a waste wont even bother since its just littered with unaffordable dlc Thinking back I used to spend my time in a private lobby on online back in the day to avoid the bad players The online could be amazing if it went back to full lobbies for heistsjobs and when the new car out was 500k and not 2 million

Its sad that theyve gotten greedy and are holding back gta 6 because online earns so much So until then its play story again and just enjoy the freedom but you cant modify cars and insure them which is the only downside"

Good
honestly disappointing generally a fun game but completely ruined by cheaters and modders online Rockstar truly does not give a shit about their games and only care about money clearly because any sort of money cheats they immediately catch on to protect their profit margins but any other kind of cheating or modding is completely overlooked because it doesnt affect profit These modders basically have admin powers that you would see on gmod servers in gta online They can spawn anything kill anyone trap you and boot you from the game They basically have god powers on any server and rockstar does jack shit They let their game rot because its still pumping out money And thats just the game side Rockstar themselves makes this game an endless grind through repetitive missions missions that are literally the same as the story mode missions with even the same animations or models used And you have to do those missions over and over to grind through level after level and slowly gain minuscule amounts of cash compared to the cost of literally anything in this game They ask for the price of most top dollar games and then proceed to use the predatory tactics to milk even more money out of you Rockstar is milking the game for everything its got with no regard for the people who play it

"I know this is an old game but it doesnt matter This issue is timeless The menu controls like a sloppy drunk wet cow that youre trying to control with your mind Its absolutely abysmal

Furthermore lets say that you dont want to use WASD keybinds from 1990 and instead you want to use ESDF keybinds that actually make sense well good luck Youll find yourself constantly running into conflicts

Worse if you decide like me that I dont care about online and I just want to play the story mode well Ill just unbind some useless online only keybinds right No no you wont The garbage game will complain that you have keybinds unbound You say yes I know still save Does it save your keybinds No You have to go back into the keybinds and bind every single useless keybind that you will never use because the developers are lazy and useless

Even simple things like clicking on a graphics setting and trying to change it It feels like I need to use telepathy to change or do anything It runs and operates so incredibly poorly

I hope this garbage isnt a sign of things to come for GTA VI"
its good
Rockstar doesnt care about the cheating in this game Every lobby you join you gotta worry about damn modders fucking your shit up The only way to not get fucked is to download cheats so you dont get fucked with every damn lobby
Yes

Recommend You can just play with any ages you want unless your parent policies
Definitely this game is epic But dont buy it at Rockstar Games cause it cost a lot how about steam with discount Student also can pay up With the GTAV and GTAOL you can play a lot such as missions racing and whatever For me this game is pretty worth it for me

GTA is honestly iconic and although Rockstar has been milking Online for money over the past couple of years the content that was available at launch and the content that was added over the years alone makes this game worth the 30 price point Although I got bored of online after about 100 something hours I still need to go back and fully complete the story mode because the progression and the missions never seem to bore me The fact that you can switch between Micheal Trevor and Franklin throughout the story make it all the more interesting as their personalities are very different from one another and playing different missions with each character feels more memorable rather than if you were confined to a single character Although I am not the biggest GTA fan to this day I have to admit that it was one of the most impressive games released in the 2010s and the fact that they continue to have a stable player base to this day means that they have made something incredible Not sure how I feel about GTA VI yet but GTA V will always stick with me as I grew up playing it
the game is just so unique overall the story mode has its downs and sad parts but besides all of that its although very good but the price is very pricey
very fun but the people online are meanies lol

i like blow up people with jet 
If you a GTA fan youll love it
It took a long time for my boy friend to get me to pay for GTA V I bought it because it was on sale and it is alright graphics are better than expect for such an old game The most fun is playing with mod gamers and they give you money or levels or kill you continuously until you quit the entire game because you cant stay alive long enough to switch servers
drogas molieres
yesssss
s
too many hackers terrible fps and crazy amounts of lag not only that but you need to be a billionaire to buy half the things 2 million for a go kart doesnt justify the price just because its new
For an old game this is still a strong and fun game If youre waiting for 6 to drop and are wondering if you should give this a try Then the answer is yes This is a great game even though it is almost 9 years old
there is always something new to do in this game chances are if youve finished this game theres still more to do not to mention its fun as all heck
Fun fun fun

good game recommend for kids under 5

its fun as long as you play offline with lots of money or if you play online get your own sever so you dont get killed
"A la 512 chica dile a tu novio que salga del closet
A veces bebe tinto a veces bebe Rosé
Borracha toíta canta No Me Conoce
Yo sé que no tiene gato hace par
Lo que quiere e bellaqueo en la playa de Ocean Park
Tiene el flow medio retro a veces usa Vans
Tiene par de envidiosa pero no se la dan
Las botellas bajando la nota subiendo
Ella mueve ese culo pa ver quién la tá viendo
El trago le llega sin estarlo pidiendo
Muchos hablando mierda y mucha mierda comiendo
La noche está pa pasto y pelea no juega pelota pero pichea
No vende droga pero toa el flow se lo capean
Se hizo la dentadura ni el sol se la blanquea
La baby siempre linda nunca fea
Eso e normal eso e rutina
Dice que la má a veces son la má fina
Échale premium le gusta la gasolina
Fuma y se pone china me caso si  como cocina"

e
I dont have words to describe this game its one game who i dont understand how this game was maked on 2013 so for me its very good and if you dont have friends you can play only because the story mode is very very good and with friends it is more fun
Good game but if i unalive andyone they will drop big money stack but you only get like 11 dollars
"Im voting this down because I have no space on my laptop to install another big game and thats partly due to GTA Online hijacking 559 GB of precious SSD space for no reason whatsoever Simply deleting the dlcpacks folder will cause certain issues in story mode so Im not keen to do that I guess it was beyond your knowledge and resources to make GTA Online a separate download like so many games on Steam It puts me off replaying the game so after installing it and not playing it for months Im just going to uninstall it again I hear thats really good for the environment

This might come as a shock to you Rockstar Games but not everyone is interested in GTA Online I mean its a possibility that theyre not even remotely curious about it When I look at the Hardware  Software Survey for Free Hard Drive Space Im shocked by the amount of free space most people have so in that sense youre in the right but youre also not the only 100 GB pony out there People are making guides to trim down oversized installs on Steam be it unnecessary language files online content or whatever Youre probably going to repeat this with GTA VI and nothing I say or do will change that because you dont care Why should you right Youve made 85 billion off this game Writing this is about as useful as telling Bezos to stop being a greedy inhumane asshole"

Recommend just singleplayer multiplayer have big problem Just bugs and dosent work
the game is dope as fuk
"Just a joke you can sort of pretend that its a game if you stick to the online version and practically imagine that there is a game but for Story Mode so the soul of a GTA is just a dump of random assets in the form of a city with a couple of halfbacked cutscenes

This is one of those games that you can use to determine the intelligence of a person Do they like it They probably also believe in horoscopes and preorder every single AAA games they can

Bad controls bad gameplay offensively stupid UX and UI a story that is a waste of time soulless characters strokeinducing mechanics and so on"
i would recomend this game to people who like to play racing games shooting games people who mod and exploit the game are always getting banned but some times you run into them other wise the game is brilliant and the majority of the time you will be to busy to notice people using modsexploits there are a lot of fun and entertaining things to do like jobs and missions races etc 
Good Game

Play the game ethically morally and legally and you should be good Also play on invite only servers the online players are toxic

Everything is expensive now they nerf heists all the time lots of hackers and some of them can even enter your private session like it happened yesterday and all Rockstar cares is about patching money glitches not about fixing the random crashings banning the hackers fixing heist bugs that can fck your 23 hour planned heist or anything useful there was a time when GTA V was enjoyable back in the 360 days but now If you can ignore all the problems or you if you just want storymodefivem maybe

"Griefers Modders and Hackers are pretty common thing youd find if you play in public lobby Theres invite only lobby where you can play alone but that kinda defeat the purpose of playing online and trying to play with other people

Theres also the problem for players like me who play GTA Online every once in a while which is the way rockstar keeps nerfing the ingame monetary rewards from heists like the Cayo Perico and the Payphone hit Making saving money to buy stuff you wantneed keeps getting longer and longer"

Not a bad game lost access to my rockstar account but apparently cant create a new one and play as youve allowed no way for us to reassociate our steam purchase with a new rockstar account So i guess i can never play GTA V again Fairwell Rockstar games

I could go on like this for ages GTA V has an abundance of such moments big and small that make San Andreas  the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas  feel like a living world where anything can happen It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly wellrealised world and tells a story thats gripping thrilling and darkly comic
GTA is one of the best game Ive been played since I was a child
its gta5
game fun but rockstar needs to fix the glitch where the snow in the winter event makes me beat my children

"I only recommend the single player Online is outdated and simple things like playing with friends is overly complicated and rife with issues Online is a money pit constantly begging for more shark cards to be able to do the content you want to do 
I originally played on console when it came out and the game then was a solid 8 or 9 outta 10  had over 300 hours on xbox 360 and xbox 1 Now i would rate single player as a 8 and Online as a 5 
just wait for Gta 6 if you want to play with friends Its just not IT anymore and its FILLED with hackers who just want to ruin everyones day sad state to come back to this game in tbh"

"So tired of these morons leaving PC out Never have consoles and PCs been so alike Yet here we are still dont have the most basic of things that have the potential to make them MILLIONS more like GTA And this week is the final straw We wait 10 years to get police and emergency vehicles and the pieces of garbage make the weekly challenge to take pictures of animals So PC cant even get it I cannot fathom to stupidity of the people working at Rockstar And how TakeTwo the neverending money printer and all around consumerhaters even allow this to happen 

Mark my words we wont even get GTA6 Ever I only hope all of you use your brains and do not give them your money so they can see what theyre going to lose out on"

"Too many hackers modders and grievers in public lobbies to be enjoyable Rockstar doesnt care about anything other than money and Im tired of their company and their playerbase making their games unplayable

Rockstar can go bankrupt for all I care Im not buying anything else from them and GTA6 will never be on my wish list Id rather boycott Rockstar games from this point on"

GTA V was an instant classic upon release and time has not yet diminished the glory of Rockstars flagship product
good
It is a fun game play and has nothing wrong with it but the only problem is that there are hackers  just wont let you progress Everytime i go to sell my stock ppl teleport to me and blow up my vehicle or if they fail they teleport back in front of the vehicle and try again until i die Until this issue is better resolved im take my leave
Will continue to play even after the release of GTA 6 The damn game has a lot of memories with friends

Another great installment in the GTA series It has everything that makes a GTA game fun and executes on them perfectly The addition of multiple characters that you can switch through was a nice touch that i hope keep with GTAVI
game
asdasda
trash dont mod even in story mode
This was a waste of my good money You cant even level up playing at the Casino without players you have not interacted with taking shots at the character This GTA 5 online version is essentially a gangstalking platform You cant enjoy leveling up without interference from other players Some people just want the Ai interaction expansion online version Not the threatening chats out of nowhere The nonsense of socalled high level players stalking a level 4 who has not used my paid for business tycoon pack as of yet BS
the only time its legal to run over old people
its so good i love it
"Listen I love this game but its over run with modders and griefers the game crashes constantly because everyone is trying to turn gta online into their own personal mod sandbox and constantly crash the session for everyone else The game takes a VERY long time to boot up so getting crashed out every hour makes it hard to justify playing the game Today Ive played for about 3 hours and havent been able to accomplish anything because i always crash about 75 of the way into an hour long task and then back to square one 

I know GTA6 is almost out but Rockstar should do something about this chaos it makes the game hard to enjoy"
gta is fun u guys should try but it takes up 50100 gb of storage so make sure when you guys this game make sure to read my review
amazing

Every time shes mad just fck attitude out of her
As a real life pilot GTAV can be used as a great tool to practice real world procedures navigation and communications While the base game may not come with the best models for airliners and will require you to purchase 3rd party addons to enjoy a realistic airline world the popular Cessna 172 comes very close to what I fly in the real world Combining the realistic Cessna with the beautiful scenery GTAV provides and a 3rd party addon for ATC communications like PilotEdge or VATSIM I can create a very realistic feeling with the simulator If I every fly an unfamiliar route in the real world I can practice it in the sim first to get familiar with the sights I will see when I really fly I can practice real world approaches as well as other instrument procedures Because the actual feeling of flying is hard to replicate I strictly do not use the simulator to practice technique as it could create bad habbits for the real world however while this may be true I can still practice working procedures and task management which sets a great foundation for myself when I return to the real cockpit
i liked michaels nuts
GTA 5 BEFORE GTA 6 IS CRAZY

its ok i dont know how too buy shark cards on steam though
Cannot play the game because I used to have my steam account under an old now dead and inaccessible email address They will not let me play the game on this steam account because I changed it Leading to one of the most insanely stupid things Ive ever seen This effectively means that because I changed my Steam email Im permanently banned from Rockstar due to this insanely stupid oversight on their part Or as I see it they forced me to boycott them After all why would I ever purchase games that Im not allowed to play

"Choosing to modcheat an online game with PvP  tiny pp energy
TLDR For the price the single player alone is makes the purchase worth it If you wish to play online youll have an great time as long as youre careful in public sessions and keep your grinding in private sessions If youre a car fan and enjoy shooters like me this game is awesome The online DLC has been consistently awesome however Rockstar cannot be bothered to implement anticheat Console players enjoy a cheaterfree experience as well as a few more features simply because theyre more profitable Protip for NVIDIA owners at the end of this review 

I decided to purchase this game in 2021 because I never actually played the single player and ended up spending close to 200 hours in it The story of Michael Franklin and Trevor is second to none This story and its game play is so good that it secured quite the profits for R in the beginning this game is the single most profitable piece of entertainment in human history Im personally very glad that the death wish ending is the canon ending as evidenced by the events of GTA online I absolutely love the default controls and how this game can seamlessly switch between my keyboard  mouse to my Dualsense controller As an aviation nerd the attention to detail when it comes to flying is incredible 

While the single player helped R make recordbreaking profits in the beginning it is the online component that kept this game profitable month after month and year after year to the tune of millions of dollars per month on average Shark cards have been selling like hot cakes for the better part of an entire decade Personally Ive never bought any shark cards and despise online cheating so 1800 hours later my character has EARNED well over 665mil and over 6mil RP all while maintaining a KD of 21 I have mastered the grind of consistently earning money and RP with most sessions netting me over 2mil Out of principle I refused to buy shark cards because R REFUSES to do anything to remedy the cheater epidemic that is present in this game The modding scene has gotten so profitable that it has been estimated to be worth millions of dollars PC players get fed over because we are statistically less likely to buy shark cards compared to our console peers follow the money and to add insult to injury those of us who solo Cayo Perico have been getting our primary takes significantly nerfed By all means make the heist more difficult but the primary takes should pay more R also decided to take away the ability to fast travel via Kosatka during bikebunker sell missions Console players enjoy a cheaterfree experience because not only do they account for a much higher profit margin for R but because their paytoplay online providers do not allow for cheating on their platforms they essentially pay a monthly protection fee Is there fun to be had in public lobbies Absolutely However one must exercise caution as modders are able to crash your game on purpose give themselves god mode as well as exposing your IP address which means you should use a VPN Do all of your grinding in a private lobby and youll be fine but be sure to switch to a single player character once a modder starts to have his way with you

NVIDIA users there is an antialiasing method that everyone should be using in order sharpen the lines of the game Go to your NVIDIA control panel  manage 3D settings  program settings  select GTA V on the drop down menu  multiframe sampled AA MFAA set to on I have personally seen this option improve the visual clarity on lowerspecd mobile cards as well as highend desktop cards "
i mean its gta v what else i need to say

killed some guy for fun he posted my ip address in chat for fun i feel safe
loved the story too many cheaters and sweats in online
"Ive had the game for quite a while 5 years ago i was pretty sure I had completely outplayed it I just played it last week and its boring but thats coming from a player with 2k hours on steam I migrated from Xbox one and 360 as I had pre ordered the game I know this review seems negative but thats only due the the lack of gta 6 If you havent ever played this you better play it because its worth it If your R then F u for making me buy this game on multiple console and platforms multiple times as you avoid releasing a new game Thats is all 

Also if you do buy it here R has gated some content to the PlayStation so they want me to buy it again or what I will not"

"The most restrictive openworld to come out of a AAA developer It picks and chooses when to be realistic almost always to the detriment of fun Youre basically playing a tech demo that tries as hard as it can to make an openworld game linear 

For a game named after a crime and known for glorifying gangsters it sure is tame AF Check out these verbatim reasons for failing ingame missions

 There was a disturbance at the showroom
 You notified the neighborhood if you make too much noise literally seconds before a scripted event that notifies the neighborhood
 You abandoned Lamar by getting out of a burning car
 Tracey fled in fear
 Franklin spooked a rival racer

Are you fucking kidding me I was half expecting emotional damage to pop up at some point 

Throw in telepathic teleporting cops who materialize out of thin air in seconds any time you fire a gun anywhere on the map and youve got a case study in wasted potential 

The gaming equivalent of paying for a fancy dinner only to find out its made of wax"

"Traditional cannoli cream uses a sheeps milk ricotta which I prefer  if I can get my hands on it Any other high fat unpasteurized milk will work Or if you want to cut some corners or are tight on time you can start off with any decent premade ricotta Skip the low fat stuff youre making cannoli

3 cups of drained ricotta

13 cups of confectioners sugar

15 tsp vanilla

Orange Zest

Using a hand or stand mixer whip together these ingredients for a few minutes until well incorporated Transfer from a bowl to a piping bag and keep in the refrigerator until ready to use

The Shells

This is part that can easily go wrong and where you need to have a zen mindset This recipe makes about 45 small to medium sized shells

15 cups of all purpose Flour

5 tsp cinnamon powder

15 tsp cocoa powder

2 tbsp white sugar

5 tsp salt

3 tbsp cubed and chilled butter

2 tbsp Marsala

5 tsp white vinegar

25 cup of water

1 egg for the wash

Heat a neutral high heat oil to 350F in a deep pot or fryer

In stand mixer combine all of the dry ingredients and mix well Add in wet ingredients except the egg and continue to blend for a few minutes Mixture will be somewhat crumbly Remove from the bowl and pour out onto a large working surface

Knead with your hands for 5  10 minutes until you have a mostly smooth and homogeneous ball of dough Wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour

Remove the dough from the plastic and cut into about 5 smaller pieces Flour the dough balls gently Pass each ball through the pasta maker going from the widest setting down about 6 settings Be slow and methodical and dont skip any steps

Lay each sheet of dough out on your work surface and gently flour again Using your circular punch out form cut circles and save all of the excess dough which youll use for one final pass through the pasta maker

Carefully and tightly wraproll each cut circle around the cannoli tube and seal the edge with your egg wash Be extremely careful not to let egg get all over the place Avoid getting the egg on the cannoli tube or the dough will end up sticking to the tube while frying Clean up any egg that gets on your work surface

When the oil temperature has reached 350F drop each tube into the oil and fry until golden Using tongs turn the cannoli in the oil so they cook evenly This should take only about 1 minute

Transfer to a rack lined with paper towels and carefully slide the shells off of the tubes while its still hot Youll want to use more paper towels so you dont burn your fingers

The tubes should be wiped down and chilled in the refrigerator for just 1  2 minutes before starting the next round of shells This avoids a lot of mess ups

The finishing touches

Once the shells have completely cooled you can start filling the cannoli This is made easier as a two person task and makes for a fun family activity but is manageable by one person if necessary Using the piping bag fill each shell starting with the center and working outwards Nothing worse than a cannoli with a big empty pocket of air in the middle Once completely filled you can garnish with whatever you like Traditional toppings include candied fruit crushed pistachio or chocolate chips When the cannoli are all dressed up and ready to go you can give them all a final dusting of confectioners sugar They should be eaten fresh as they start to lose their textural appeal if they sit around too long and get soggy"

What can be said about Grand Theft Auto V that hasnt already been said a million times This game is a masterpiece and I am blown away by how modern it feels even 10 years after its release Sure the controls can be a bit janky and the story gets messy towards the end but as an all around experience it still holds up incredibly well Every time I play this game I feel like I went on vacation to California The world feels so alive and its full of many activities The attention to detail is absolutely mindboggling The minigames actually have plenty of depth to them You can spend hours playing golf and tennis or cruising around and taking in the sights at various beaches mountains and forests Car customization is very deep and rivals every racing game out there that was out in 2013 Also a special shout out to the soundtrack which is full of every genre you can think of and ranges from old school throwbacks to modern for 2013 music to even some updated recent songs that released long after GTA V came out Although the story may not please everyone this game has some of the most memorable characters in all of gaming Franklin Trevor Michael Lamar even the yoga instructor are all unforgettable characters There is constantly something fun going on in this game and theres never a dull moment
hi
Great game but there are bugs that require you to either reset the game or play with your settings Overall this game is prob one of my fav OAT
good game
"This is really weird i actually like this game Its a decent grinding game

The grind for money is not that hard if you know what to do and its been a blast for the past few months robbing drug lord over and overstealing from heavily guarded casino in town and saving the world from doomsday with my friend

The community is actually not that bad while yes i agree modder and griefer are pain in the ass but the majority of player i meet in public or heist is friendly and chill 

Cant wait what gta 6 and gta online 2 can offersuperr excited"
i really like it is better then xbox gta because on xbox gta its more hard to shoot and you can play fivem and i give gta pc 
disappointing strip club
it good
IS ASS
"story mode is a masterpiece
Online is cringy af Too grindy too little reward"

Amaxing game

great game
Game is fun for a couple of months but once you get rich and start owning all the items in the game there really isnt anything to do since you have every heist unlocked they need to add new heists instead of all these dumb new vehicles it got so bad for me to the point i decided to download cheats and give myself 10000B dollars because i wanted to be banned so my account could be reset to restart the game and it didnt take me even 2 weeks to get to level 50 and unlock most heists get the game its fine at the start
I shoot and drive
Once I got it running on the Steam Deck it was great But the installation experience was bad Its pain to enter login information in the stupid Rockstar launcher and then it tells you to enter a key but doesnt specify what key it is For some reason in my case performance initially was severely degraded but after hard resetting the Steam Deck multiple times it finally recovered

"Grand Theft Auto V 2013

Second GTA i ever owned in my life the first one was GTA 3 on my old Netbook with Windows XP back when i was 9
the only reason i got to buy it on Steam despite having it on the PS3 was that it had GTA Online pretty good online in my opinion played it like 8 times and im still on level 5 since i got the game back in May 2023 im going to rate both the Story Mode and the Online mode now so lets start with Story Mode

Story Mode
ah yes the Story Mode Warning Includes Spoiler but im sure everyone knows already the entiry story by now so pretty interesting some Heist that happend 20 years ago in 2004 bla bla bla 9 years later 2013 and 2 of those guys responsible for the heist meet again bla bla bla murdering and shit

i rate the Story Mode 9 missing copies of GTA 3 on the PS3 and Xbox 360 out of 10

Online Mode
this review is too long so fuck it 7510"
"10 years old in 2001 I got GTA 3 I begged my mom
11 years old in 2002 I bought Vice city at school a classmate sold it to me cause his PS2 broke
13 in 2004 bought SA
17 in 2008 bought GTA IV
22 in 2013 bought GTA V
34 in 2025 will buy GTA VI

Rockstars GTA games have become an integral part of my life and Im grateful for the joy theyve brought me"
it is a cool game
love it
hi

I want to kms Oppressor mk2 people are r wording me
i only drive around in story mode and do the same in online mode besides causing pain and misery occasionally to people just trying to have fun by killing them

"1010
1 person said happy new years thats more than people in real life we winning"
very good
"After almost 500 hours of gameplay inside and outside of Steam I can confidently tell you that Rockstar treats its player base horribly So many parts of the Online experience are forced to be done solo as they have no benefit to doing them with friends Payouts for almost every single activity is minimal and feels like a spit in the face after you realize grinding for 100 hours will only net you disappointment Every part of the Online experience is there to punch you in the dick and then hand you a single ice cube to make it sting a little less but Rockstar are still the ones who did the kicking in the first place

If you want to play this game for its online be prepared to ditch all public lobbies since they have at least one hacker in them at all times All things worth doing will be done in a Crew only lobby or in a closed mission where you can typically only bring in 3 friends Rockstar may keep pushing horrible content updates that give you new ways to waste time but theyre never going to be worth investing your time Do not buy this game do not buy their next GTA just dont waste your time with these disrespectful developers"
cool game
yes
"dopey

its fun tbh
buy it
"Very good game with an amazing story and good graphics for its release date Btw for the people playing online and didnt get anything from the criminal enterprise starter pack wait from 12 to 24 hours and make sure you finished the prologue in the story mode Go into settings and then on online Click on criminal enterprise starter pack From there you can view all the properties vehicles and more 

NOTE You can only get the weapons if you are under level 5 To get the properties and the other things you need to be over level 5 to claim them"
Bro I cant even play the game I logged in with a social user on the rockstar games launcher and It talks about unlinking an accout or sum and I contact support they help but I still cant play I have tryed everything I can

great game classic
My fondest memory of this game was seeing a van drive up with Fred from Scooby Doo exiting it and running up to me to clock me straight in the face
its a very good game only bad part is the amount of storage it takes
"It has been more than six years since I last played this game

The single player campaign was and remains the most impressive one in any game that I have ever played I can still recall various plot twists and angles of the story As for character design it doesnt get much better than Trevor Now I dont know if GTA6 which was announced late 2023 will ever come to PC but if its anything like GTA5 its going to be great

I didnt play much of the GTA5 Online because I quickly got tired of all the hackers and griefers However get this game for the single player campaign it is awesome"

"Since invitationonly sessions and more SOLO missions have existed GTA Online is worth a lot more

BUT it bothers me too much that the PC version is less supported than the other platforms Where is the ray tracing update What about the animals in GTA Online 

PC players deserve more respect"
Ive played on and off for over 1500 hours since release I just tried to come back to the game after a few months away and now Rockstar wont let me log into my account or send me a password reset email Seems to be a fairly common issue too I dont know what their deal is but if youre going to lock your game behind DRM the least you can do is make sure it can handle basic account management
its fuc king great
good
"The strength and uniqueness of GTA is that it includes many games into one This one is no different  there are a ton of things you can do with your friends especially when you start buying different businesses

I would probably not recommend it for solo as it is doable but feels more boring therefore more grindy and not ideal The PC port doesnt seem to be perfect but it should be running well on most current machines"

I saw enough reviews to know not to touch the online mode But the story and gameplay are everything you know and love about rockstar games Zany characters Social commentary Cool heists Still a good game by all accounts even in 2023

I am a new player to GTA V online I am trying to do my best but the game is just bullshit full of bugs and players are so cringe killing you with every occasion There is an email that you get in game with a treasure hunt if you finish this mission I think you get like 250ktreasure hunt The problem is that every time I get this email and start the mission after a while the session of game ends due to and unsuspected error it is 3rd time when this happened to me and I have to wait hours to get that email again and hopefully the session wont end do to an UNSUSPECTED ERROR again FKING ROCKSTAR GAMES

Great game I love it
Its a very fun game
"Positive GTA 5 is a powerful continuation of a legendary gaming series that has captured my heart since its early days The games strength lies in its extensive and captivating story which can be experienced from three different character perspectives providing the game with incredible replayability and depth Each character is uniquely designed and contributes to a rich and engaging world full of life and adventure The multiplayer aspect also shines with a variety of missions and activities that can be undertaken solo or with friends creating dynamic and unpredictable gaming scenarios

Negative Despite the many positive aspects the multiplayer part receives criticism for going overboard with certain elements especially when it comes to the introduction of overly futuristic vehicles like flying motorcycles For me this has disrupted the realistic and downtoearth feel that the GTA series has traditionally aimed for creating an imbalance in the games dynamics

Summary GTA 5 stands as a titan in the gaming world with a rich and dynamic narrative memorable characters and a fun and extensive multiplayer mode While some elements in multiplayer may feel exaggerated the games overall offering is still of an exceptional caliber that few other games can match For longtime fans and new players alike GTA 5 offers a world filled with adventure laughter and excitement"

"ATTENTION Enable dual factor authentication to protect your account I have over 500 hours in this game and someone was able to switch the email I was using I have sent multiple tickets to Rockstars support with help regarding this issue and have been blown off Look it up on Google Many people have lost their accounts to this issue for YEARS and its STILL occurring 

Lets say that you want to try a different Rockstar account when you start the game through steambecause of the way GTA is linked to your steam and Rockstar account you will not be able to play the game through a different Rockstar account Also due to this issue I have lost other Rockstar games associated with my account I spent my hard earned money on multiple Rockstar products now they are permanently lost and there is nothing I can do about it Shame on Rockstar for not even remotely trying to fix this issue"

GTA 5 for PC is a masterpiece with exciting missions diverse gameplay and stunning graphics The attention to detail in the vast world of Los Santos is impressive Its a mustplay game and one of the best of all time Dont miss out on this extraordinary experience before GTA 6

Best game ever
its fun playing with you friends
"If your expecting a masterpiece based on how many people know this game and the hype that is following gta 6 then I dont recommend this game If your looking for interesting and engaging story I dont recommend if you want to just drive around city stealing stuff and killing cops then I recommend the game
The characters you meet in the game are interesting and the banter is enjoyable to witness but as far as their own character progression goes there is none
Entertaining moment are sandwiched in between long travel times The travelling does get very boring to the point where you just end up taking the taxi everywhere as it is more efficient
The open world while very lively and believable is pretty shallow and lacks content
Minus the travel times the missions are fine but each mission lacks a strong tie to the story to the point where a lot of the missions feel like filler stuff just so the gang can do interesting things This leads to moments where there isnt something to keep you looking forward to the next thing
There is stat upgrades like better stamina or better shooting which you upgrade by using that actual stat If you run a lot then your stamina will upgrade Overall the upgrades are minimal and dont end up changing your play style"

Fun Good story and fun online Fun to play with friends and shooter planes
decent story mode and online mode when there isnt cheaters and greifers for online mode i would recommend making a private game for you and your friends to avoid those types of people
THe game for when you ever felt like you had to just go and do when the cars and you grab them and then drive them until you commit a crime or atrocity of sort within the confines of the game then go to the job of sorts and steal and plunder from the innocent and it could last 10 minutes 1 hour 5 hours as the crow flies maybe consider this game as one of them that is good and maybe not one to be skipped out on like i know you want
After half a decade of virtual pennypinching I finally splurged on GTA V with my hardearned cash  I used to roll with the crcked cruising the digital streets on a budget because lets face it my wallet was as empty as my ingame garage Now every pixel in Los Santos knows Im legit Who needs reallife cash when you can buy a virtual yacht and live your best pixelated life My bank account may be crying but my ingame character is living their best life The things we do for love and epic car chases

pretty good its kind of confusing when you first start but you might not have that
i love indiscriminate murder
Good story  good characters But in offline main characters are not allowed to purge cops and to 0 within a period   of time This is very ANNOYING and really ruins the gaming experience In Fallout 4 or Witcher 3 although guards will reappear main character can always completely eliminate them within a certain period of time

THE BEST
"Abysmal loading times constant crashes full to the brim with pointless mechanics and busy work that make even the simplest gameplay convention into a chore

The online mode is fun but completely broken Constant glitches from missions that become unbeatable to expensive ammo and resources just disappearing out of my inventory for no reason every now and then 
Many official online missions clearly had little to no play testing done and some of them are truly miserable experiences even before you take the griefers into account
Its also grindy as Hell but we all know thats intentional to tempt you into buying CRIMINALLY EXPENSIVE microtransactions
And lets not forget the complete lack of moderation so hackers just run rampant to a frankly astonishing degree I usually stick to invite only sessions because public online is just unplayable at this point

Of course if anything bad happens like you get hacked or lose access to your account Rockstar doesnt give a damn You just cant play or even make a new account anymore sucks to be you

The story mode is pretty good all things considered"

GTA 6 IS COMING BABY

I am a 45 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father raising my son who is now 14 years old My son won this game from his uncle so we installed him on his computer and he started playing Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game This was horrible for me because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him I bought the game chose my skin and world and started playing but I was stuck in what you should do I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate I loved it because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died Since then this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well This game reminded me that there is fun in everything and I brought many happy memories to me and my son

My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on gtav and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here"

"would expect a lot more maturity from a 10 year old game

the game is fully bugged every session I play I will hit some kind of issue or another

dont have this problem with any other game

examples
 sit down on computer gets stuck
 login to computer gets stuck
 get into some buildng get stuck
 receivesend some transaction get stuck

half the time it gets stuck it just shows a black screen for 15 mins or longer until I get kicked out of the session for being inactive

how am I supposed to play the game"
online is so much fun i plunged a knife in my spleen

"Grand Theft Auto V isnt just a game its a memory its broken the barrier past nostalgia and become something entirely different Every moment in the fictional city of Los Santos is a testament to the care and detail the developers have poured into this creation Its not just the stunning visuals or the dynamic soundtrack that make this game a masterpiece but the way it makes you feel part of an expansive living world The story woven through the lives of Michael Trevor and Franklin is more than just a series of missions its a journey through their wild lives and achieves a level of immersion that I have yet to replicate in other games today

The heart of GTA 5 lies in its ability to offer something for everyone Whether youre tearing through the streets in a highspeed chase enjoying a quiet moment watching the sunset over the Vinewood hills or teaming up with friends in GTA Online the game seamlessly blends adrenalinepumping action with quiet moments Its this balance that makes the experience so memorable GTAV will always keep its position as top 5 games ive ever played I remember being 11 years old with my PS3 going to that gamestop with my mom and getting the game bringing it home launching the game and hearing that echo of the siren in the loading screen Nothing beats this feeling and I dont think anything will come close to this for any other generation

"The support is an absolute disgrace You are forced to carry out very long tests in order to be able to send a message The support itself consists of an AI or cognitively untalented aliens 

The scam with the Social Club connecting to Steam  which means you cant create a new Social Club account  is intended to milk the cow again 

Ive been playing GTA since childhood Not anymore"

Chumma Game 
Not very happy Rockstar even though I chose my local storage drive decided on their own to place files on a cloud drive now 22hrs of gameplay gone I dont use cloud services so when i got a message saying it was fulli just deleted it and paused syncing This is a little creepy since I never gave permission to anyone to access my onedrive account no where did it ask I installed to a local storage m2 drive not the cloud To top it off this is the third time ive bought this dam game 1st pc 2nd ps4 and now again pc First time account was stolen and pc stolen at same time Ps4 well lost all that to life problems but now i could install through steam so fealt safe and bought again only to have it not be and to be some real creapy like looking into places i never gave access I looked now they got files and folders again all over the onedrivecloud drive just from playing again and thats just messed up cause i agin said no to cloud and that said rockstar servers but idk this is just crazy

A good game
Its not as good as the rest of the GTA games but the story is still decent and can be pretty fun Online is kinda garbo though The characters are charismatic and funny and they all have good character development and arcs So would I recommend this game Yes Id say I would though its rather disappointing in a way cause the story in GTA IV is so much better still its a really good game though with great gameplay
its fuin whenever alayws got sum to do
very fun support takes a while to respond but when they do support is decent

I love the quality of this game and theres sp may experiences in it
allows me to fulfill my terroristical dreams
Last time I played GTA V is when i had a slim Xbox 360 Got the game on a good sale on Steam and im flabbergasted on how many detailed improvements have been made with this game Replaying the story is always delightful with the life like lighting effects more detail to facial animation and better performance in frame rate Bravo to the devs at Rockstar Games
great game to play
Good game but sadly I had to uninstall because of a lack of space
its amazing
Singleplayer is good Online is perfect with zero flaws doesnt crashfreeze at all and works perfectly all the time
GTA5 is a good game Period W game frfr

"These people dont know how to program a game

Edit
The more I play the worse it gets These people really dont know how to design a game

Edit two
This game does everything possible to make you NOT play with your friends It doesnt matter if you are friends on Steam friends on Rockstars Social Club as well as Crew Members in the game that you register through a web page The game will STILL make it SO YOU CAN NOT PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS Every mission it kicks you out Every Heist it kicks you out If you play a game of tennis it kicks you out YOU CANNOT STAY TOGETHER NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO ITS STUPID DO NOT BUY THIS OR GTA6 DO NOT SUPPORT THIS TRASH COMPANY
If your in a heist with one friend your other friend CANNOT JOIN your server After you complete the heist The friend you were with get separated onto two different servers Even after hosting a private friends only  crew only server
Also you cant even host a private online game without first going in to single player If you just start online mode it throws you in a random game of strangers without even asking you if you want it friends only or not
SO IN ORDER TO PLAY YOU DO THE FOLLOWING
Start single player host a private game wait for friends to join do a heist get separated into two different servers host a private game wait for friends to join play tennis leave the court get separated into two different servers host a private game wait for friends to join again rinse repeat and never actually enjoy the game

Edit again
It keeps scattering my friends across different servers and launching games when everyone is not ready Only 2 of my 3 friends are in the lobby and the game forces a start Starts a cutscene that we cannot skip even though weve already seen it before and so we all have to AltF4 to quit the game While still struggling to get my 3rd friend into the game Who programmed this junk Its horrible

Edit 1202024
I dont know what they did but now the game is even worse then it was before"

"What should you do to stay healthy until 2025 and be able to play GTA VI

Sleep at least 8 hours a day
Exercise every day 15min walking or jogging are more than enough This reduces risk of having a heart attack
Stay hydrated
Eat healthy Important nutrients for eye health include vitamin A vitamin C vitamin E zinc and omega3 You can eat walnuts instead of potato chips while lying on the couch Through that when walking on the street you can see a car more clearly notice obstacles such as potholes sewer pipes on the ground and avoid injuring yourself
Reduce the risk of infection by paying attention to hand washing
Remove toxic people from your life This helps to protect your mental health
If you smoke please try to quit
Dont push anyones buttons You probably wont want to get beaten or killed
While it might not have a direct impact on your health to enjoy GTA VI more youll need to focus on it Stop watching porn and those  10second videos that  with your skill"

gta online has a lot of lag and delay they cant even show the delay in milliseconds

Online is now full of hackers Most players have been here a long time and can be helpful if you show the ability to be helpful to them Meaning the CEO organization thing is a great way for a low level player to gain money and level Problem is its still GTA online and everytime you log in you are subject to possibly the worst gaming experience or sometimes the best you ever had 1010 must play must own had to have been there
Gta is rally legend game and gta V is super cool game You can play online i like Roleplay thats amazing So this game really must be in everyone library
Fun playin gainst opressors 
DOPEEEEEEEEE
"this game is addicting but i fucking hate flying missions in it 
1010 money killing robbing driving"
Funny USA simulator Online mode is def better than Rdr2 online
its gta 5
very funny game to beat up your friends in
ธหยด
story is 1010 online is fun w game
Better dont  waste your time and money on this gave specifically  GTA Online  as it is full of cheaters and modders which will ruin your game play in every server that you join When you finish important  mission or delivery they will find  way to either kick you out of the room or crash your game Story is good but if you come for the Online better go somewhere else as it is visible that Rockstar has zero interest in fixing the 80 modder population which feels like kings in the game

it is really fun and good and entertaining and good and fun and funny and cool and fun and entertaining
love shooting people
"To start Ill say this my whole life Ive always wanted to play this For real that is After all nearly every person I knew had played it We had it on the Xbox 360 when I was younger and I remember I used to sneak on it before hearing a parent coming close to the room so I quickly exited and booted up Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga They knew something was up as every time they came in I was on the title screen

Anyway several years later and Ive finally played through the entire story It went by about as quick as a breeze not because its shortif anything its a decently long storybut because it was so fun
Usually every game has at least one mission that is extremely annoying just because its no fun to do  but this game was a gem And if theres anything Grand Theft Auto has taught me about gems
its a steal"
cant wait for gta six
"SHIT ASS GAME
ONLINE IS PRACTICALLY UNPLAYABLE 

THIS GAME BY FAR HAS THE WORST ANTI CHEAT

I hate that PC gets blamed for the cheaters when its always been rockstars fault
ive put almost 2k hours in this game IMAGINE MAKING BILLIONS ON A GAME AND NEVER SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY THAT PUT YOU WHERE YOU ARE"

Really Very Addictive Game Once you start playing you cant leave
Used to play on xbox and servers were pretty good Pc servers are trash and filled with modders I had my feet randomly explode up and atomizer shots rain from the sky the entire lobby teleported to one spot on map players that are invincible with indestructible vehicles and constant spam to dupe cars or sell money It makes it nearly impossible to progress in any way On top of that going into business consistently gives me a black screen that never loads up and I have had multiple disconnects Its a pretty new game though so hopefully they will get this stuff sorted out in the future
otimo jogo
every time i try do a heist it gives me an inifinite sky loading screen and no its not a problem with my network
Fun
nice
i got back into this game for about a week and nothing but annoying modders that keep fucking booting you off the game or some shit this game has turned to absolute garbage it isnt even fun to play anymore
kinda gets boring after a while but its really good and quality made
I LIKE THIS GAME
One of the best games frfr

An extremely great game Truly still stands now in 2023
Well what can I say about GTA V if not GTA V Online which is the one Ive played the most and will mention Well its riddled with issues in various ways to the point where the game is flooded with hackers everywhere You really feel absolutely nothing when conquering a yacht or a mansion the game is so saturated with hackers that everyone has everything and public sessions are complete chaos And seriously its no joke how many hackers there are The other day they put me inside a container and I had to leave the session because I couldnt escape the hacker kept forcing me into that container So reconsider spending your money on this game if youre only going to play online its really not worth it Now the story mode on the other hand is worth it It doesnt have the limitations of online and even features animals and a whole living universe unlike online So thats it grab it on sale have fun and please dont use hack in this game

"Update GTA Online on PC is absolute trash and full of hackers If you report them the report is actually sent from their PC which their mod menu detects blocks it and makes everyone in the session unable to do anything You invited you to your own apartment screen and so ow or they just make you unable to move and blow everyone up 
And then they make you a target and keep messing up the following sessions you join

What a poop show Rockstar


Good game but clearly designed as controller first the aircraft controls are horrible on PC compared to other games
There should have been fast travel to properties player owns around the map apart from changing spawn location and restarting session as work around Driving to properties on other side of the map simply to check suppliesstart a mission is a huge waste of  collective human hours
The session management also wastes a lot of time in loading screensending people from crewfriends sessions to public sessions after each mission
Rockstar mustve done it to increase active game time to show for stats  Hope this changes in GTA VI"

GOOD GAME

ta bueno
I do like this game all in all man but the one problem is the amount of hackers in this game all Im saying is that ROCKSTAR needs a better anti cheat
guud gayme
Its good
this is very good game
If you want to be able to play this game play storymode or in a private server since you will most likely end up getting hacked or griefed by a modder if you play on a public server The game itself is fun its grindy as fuck in online but fun Ive been playing it on Xbox for years But yeah I cant bring myself to recommend a game that might get you hacked so until Rockstar fixes their problems I cant recommend this And yes I got kicked out of the game by a hackermodder just before writing this
my favorite part of this game is the shoe store such a variety of shoes my favorite are the white shoes but if you prefer the black shoes thats okay too in fact you can like any type of shoes and nobody is to judge you you can even enjoy boots instead and whos to say otherwise unless you like to walk around bare foot then you disgust me
why is franklin black
its GTA what else is there to say
We all know its worth it
got corseted by oppressors as a lvl 8 dont cop
All about money  Bought the game with start up pack and in game cash Cant even acces to it activation code dont work even tho it clearly shows that the pack is dowloaded and ready to access too much information needed for them to help you or they send you straight to the QA that clearly does not satisfy the client with their satisfaction rate In other words its what called a scam

This is a very iconic game The characters are lovable and they elevate the experience Franklin is the best Fight me

The story represents how corrupt and sad our current society is 

Pacing can be slow at times but its overall a good experience

Gun fights are very intense and fun

I recommend this game if you like open world exploring andor action adventure games"

I would NOT recommend this game for new players unless youre gonna do story mode if youre gonna do online be prepared for the oppressor players and hackers the dlcs in online are great but i would highly recommend getting friends to do it with since randoms are almost always a POS also would recommend getting versions of the game where you start out with a lot of money so that you can actually have a chance of winning against oppressor players who sit in they moms basement jobless
fun game but if u have a bad PC dont get it
wow online is just so antiplayer isnt it

i like this game
Just a reminder that the source code for GTAV has been leaked If there are any vulnerabiltiesbugs that grant access to your computer the hacker community has them Hackers could already access private lobbies before this so going invite only wont help you
i can steal and drive

I played this game for first time and it was on Steam Deck i didnt know it will need other launcher and internet connection to start the game ngl this was pretty anoying to create account in RockStar launcher to download it and to do everything on my Steam Deck without wireless keyboard and mouse it was pretty shit even few times cannot type on the virtual keyboard and so on  at the end everything sets like magic after struggling lol dont understand why also need internet  because i dont play online mode i play story mode  well after all set up the game looks pretty good and the fps its almost always 60 which is perfect I will recommend this game on Steam Deck even though all this shits i mention because the game its pretty fun to play even just to drive car run from police or listening music and chilling But keep in mind i have around 10 hrs in the game and the game uFREEZES 23 times so i need to hard resetu I didnt expirience this with other games till now
extremely good game i  just wish there was a tutorial from where different missions are
BUGS AND HACKERS ARE LEADING ONLINE VERSION OF GTA5

"I give modders 6 months with the source code before online is completely unplayable and infested with mods and crypto mining servers

If it wasnt unplayable already itll honestly be a data protection risk come 2024

Id say stick to single player or the thousands of mods for it that youll pretty much never run out of stuff to do Or risk having your computer filled with spyware online up to you"

Great game but rockstar needs to update PC to next gen There is no good reason besides greed that PC players can not have Haos workshop and other such next gen features There would be no problem porting all of those features and Im fairly sure mod clients for RP servers already have them Update the damn game
Lots of modded modes make the game better in my opinion

Plagued with hackers in every lobby now But its fine as long as Rockstar focuses on whats important DLC

Jesus Fcking Christ the solo missions in this game for online are impossible and require a google search to even have a shot at figuring out what kind of stupid roundabout way of doing things the missions wants you to do Only play story mode Stay away from online unless youre messing around with friends If youre looking to play a game for fun or to relax steer clear The mechanics and missions are that frustrating

"Turns out if you  dontt remember your Rockstar Online information theres no way to play the game
Even if you offer for them to take it out of your library and to pay full price for it again

Obviously Thats The best Game Ever Released
"Story Compelling and intricate A blessing to experience with lessons from a gritty grim depiction of the West of Western culture

Online Was once a great game to play with friends and charade with randoms but this is the PC port Total cashgrab pricing of ingame multiplayer content turned it into 1930s German economy simulator where they prompt you to ask your wallet for permission to buy the most overrated possessions known to man  Virtual vehicles

A curse no doubt conjured by the Rockstar North corporate beancounters that analyzed the profit of holiday and birthday gift revenue coming from these aforementioned dream vehicles back in 2014
It was when missions paid a Nth of any purchasable ingame content The grind was not worth it even when the prices mirrored the real worlds retail prices of cars and weapons Punks with dough to spend and hackers were swift to drop in and find ways to accumulate ingame currency without grindy gameplay The well was poisoned before the water had time to collect at the bottom"

"Gather your friends for an exciting GTA V experience But caution if youre playing solo  GTA Online has lots of hackers
Main Recommendation
Consider trying out GRAND RP a cuttingedge server for GTA
Its a blacklist server but its way ahead of its time
Boasts a dedicated team of admins ensuring a great gameplay and roleplay experience
Make new friends and receive cool goodies regularly from the game administration
Conclusion Some outcomes of my experience
 For a better safer and more enjoyable time in GTA give GRAND RP a shot
 Its a standout choice for those looking for quality roleplay and a hackerfree environment"

"Grand Theft Auto V GTA 5 is an absolute masterpiece that continues to captivate players with its unparalleled openworld experience dynamic characters and immersive gameplay Released in 2013 the game has stood the test of time and remains a shining example of what an openworld actionadventure game can achieve

One of the most impressive aspects of GTA 5 is its vast and meticulously crafted open world the fictional state of San Andreas The attention to detail is extraordinary with a diverse range of landscapes from bustling urban environments to serene countryside and picturesque coastal areas The level of detail in the game world is staggering and it creates an incredibly immersive experience for players

The game features three playable protagonistsMichael Trevor and Franklineach with their own distinct personality background and set of skills This innovative approach to storytelling adds depth to the narrative and allows players to experience the storyline from multiple perspectives The character development is exceptional and the writing is topnotch making each protagonist memorable in their own right

GTA 5 excels in offering a wide variety of activities beyond the main storyline From adrenalinepumping heists and thrilling car chases to golf tennis and base jumping the game provides an extensive range of diversions to keep players engaged for hours on end The attention to detail extends to the side missions and activities making them just as enjoyable as the main storyline

The games graphics and attention to realism are outstanding even years after its initial release The level of detail in the character models vehicles and environments is remarkable and the games lighting effects contribute to a visually stunning experience

Furthermore GTA Online the multiplayer component of GTA 5 adds another layer of longevity to the game With a vast open world to explore cooperative and competitive missions and a constant stream of updates and new content GTA Online provides endless hours of entertainment for players

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a landmark achievement in the gaming industry Its combination of a richly detailed open world compelling characters engaging storyline and diverse gameplay options make it a mustplay for any fan of the actionadventure genre Even years after its release GTA 5 continues to be a shining example of the incredible potential of video games as an art form and entertainment medium"

good game  waiting for next update
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
My friend bully me very bad cry emoji
Not only has this game resulted in the lifelong arrest of an autistic person that has never hurt anybody or intended to hurt anybody but it also locked me out because you need a rockstar account and cant login with your steam account I forgot the password and no longer have access to the gmail account linked to it Theres also the fact that Rockstar has absolutely RUINED GTA online by implementing pay to win aspects with overpowered vehicles that are obtained by you guessed it ingame money that can be bought with real life money The only reason they never do anything about it is because having these overpowered vehicles create incentive for people to purchase those vehicles to fight against people who already have those vehicles but what do you know these vehicles are fucking expensive so you can either grind for these vehicles or purchase money for these vehicles This is only made worse by the fact most of the content in GTA online costs a metric fuck ton of ingame money so you cant really have fun without investing into rockstars most disliked industry or by spending litteral days just to afford to purchase a random fucking building to start the content chain The grinding is made worse only by the fact that while you grind you get called and texted by in game characters advertising the content you cant afford and the devs will constantly create more content that you cant afford
Honestly pretty good

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS GAME AS ALWAYS SINCE ITS NOSTALGIC AND IM A BILLIONAIRE NOW SINCE IM IN THE GRIND
i went to the strip club highly recomend
Love it
VERY GOOD
"Rockstar requires that Social club is linked to Steam which seems like it shouldnt be an issue unless like me the Rockstar launcher is saying that an account with an email Ive never made nor seen in my life is linked to the account They wont let a new social club account sign in because it is not linked to Steam I assume they did this to ensure I paid for the game but the fact that I can launch from Steam should be proof enough This is highly unethical Ive played tons of other games with their own launchers and they all let you switch to a differentnew account you created after launching through Steam Im essentially out of my money or stuck playing offline which is not part of the original purchase agreement 

You pay for a game believing the multiplayer will work seamlessly and when it doesnt it feels like youve been scammed because you have been Just pirate this game I shouldnt have to look up guides read Reddit posts or talk to support just to get a product I purchased working The process to recover this account is highly convoluted and the Rockstar website wont even allow me to sign in under the new account I made to contact support even though I verified my account and everything Why even spend the money for a headache just take to the seas

Edit

I was wrong I cant even play offline since that requires you to sign in too Instead of launching offline it just gives an error since the Rockstar launcher doesnt work without wifi Ive literally been scammed by a AAA game company insane"
Franklin is black   
Cant run the game when I bought it so I returned it
To meany cheaters and moders ruining online lobbys and there is no friend party system
The GTAO hackers are so bad they managed to rip my social club account from under me and I have no way to access the game I payed for anymore Thanks Rockstar

Even after 10 years this game look fresh and new Really liked the single player mode

"Ive had problems with this game I didnt like it very much at launch gameplay felt weird I didnt like the characters etc Now that Ive been playing all 3D GTA games in order I can better appreciate the evolution of the series This is the best GTA has played and looked ever so much so Id be tempted to play it all again if it werent for GTA Online

Im gonna be honest at first I was so frustrated with the GTA Online I left a negative review I felt the game was constantly fucking me over and wasting my time Its a rough start but if you can survive that the game starts to feel rewarding Its grindy though be prepared to do the same things over and over again Story is mainly locked behind endgame content businesses costing millions and so on But there are some pretty nice returns of characters from the main game here and there GTA Online is like crack you know its bad for you but you cant stop taking it"

"Let me sum this up by saying the following
Base Game Reccomended
     This is a classic hit by R for all to enjoy just like the rest of the GTA Library
Online Play Not Reccomended
     This is a mobile game disguised as a GTA online experience yes I was suckered into it back in 2015 as well for the short time I had friends

who played it too Any new expansion that comes out to get you to pay for shark cards is an easy way to make money when all they need to do is add an OP car and a plethora of shitty by comparison cars all too expensive for their own good Avoid this game if you want to keep your salary or your job R knows youll lose one or the other playing

And sure it might be a great experience now but the point is dont pay for shark cards"

Take everything with a grain of salt and have fun go in knowing everything you sell and do can be ruined and it seems to not ruin your day solo cayo perico is the easist but a grindy way to make millions and fun tip buy lots of garages and all the garage levels from the arcade ad keep all your cars youll end up regretting sellling them and you always lose money on them so no reason to go down the rabbit hole of desperation for a new mediocre car

"Yes for the 10 I paid for it but its a very flawed game and a sign of the low standards of gaming today

This one is by far the best GTA yet and also still shows their failings in knowing how to advance the series This game like all GTA games is a fun chaos simulator When the game tries to be serious the flawed mechanics are obvious Its clear Rockstar has no intention of improving them much

The first thing I noticed is Rockstar doesnt respect their players This was a single player series that now focuses on multiplayer and the single player game is hurt for it The fact that different gen consoles got moreless content is also an insult to customers 

The city is by far the best theyve done yet Its vast and beautiful and very well realized I love driving around in it Its added by the fact that you can put your own music in the radio Thats something that should be a standard today The commercials they add really make it better 

The story and three protag concept is cool and it works very well I cant say I care for it or the characters These have never been why I played GTA in the first place The constant bickering just wears thin far too fast

I like the arcade feeling of the driving in this over the fish tailing of GTA 4s cars Motorcycles are actually usable again 

Sadly theres just so many problems with this game

First the game is not optimized well On a 3070 running 1080p at 60 fps I had to turn MXAA off to get over 30fps It held a solid 60 until I went underwater It would sit around 15fps underwater This is just terrible The standards of poor games people accept today just makes me sad

The whole structure of the game is poor If you want any chance of making money you have to do the story first What little reward there is to having all that money is just planes and helicopters that cant really be used as all the meaningful gameplay is gone Businesses have such a poor Return Of Investment youll be waiting forever for them to pay off Cars are absolutely worthless except to look at in story mode If you buy them they can disappear in seconds you cant use them in most missions because Rockstar has once again failed to innovate on their lazy programming You go out of your way to grind money for a car take it to a missionand once again they stick you with the shittiest car because they dont understand how to make a game difficult Therefore theres no point to going after money or vehicles In multiplayer your cars get saved Not in story mode because they dont care about it They specifically devalue their own product This is the same thing they do in Max Payne 3 where he constantly throws away machine guns to pull out a pistol That shits just amateur hour

The mission structure often fails as they stick you in a position where Michael drives and Franklin shoots They put the characters in positions where their abilities arent useful This makes meaningful gameplay hard as the game is catered against its strengths When I picked ending C they disable sprint in the firefightyep Theyre that desperate to fake difficulty

Collision physics are inconsistent You dont know what will stop you dead or get knocked over This wasnt as big of a problem  in past games

The hidden packages dont appear unless you save and reload the game They dont tell you this and they actually patched this is in 

 The AI is dumb and often drives right into you

The police come when you punch someone out in the middle of nowherebecause birds call them not a joke Artificial difficulty is lazy work Yes its easy to lose thembut it becomes tedious time consumption for no reason The police are very inconsistent Sometimes a one star level takes minutes while a two star level takes seconds to lose Theyre not difficult just annoying"

Grand Theft Auto V GTA 5 is an immensely popular video game known for its openworld gameplay captivating storyline and extensive multiplayer features The game offers a vast and detailed virtual world to explore allowing players to engage in thrilling missions car chases and heists The pros of GTA 5 include its immersive and visually stunning graphics diverse range of playable characters and the freedom it grants players to navigate the virtual environment The multiplayer component GTA Online offers an expansive multiplayer experience with numerous activities and missions However the game does have some cons to consider It contains mature content and explicit violence which may not be suitable for all players or age groups Additionally the games size and complexity can be overwhelming for some and it may require a significant time investment to fully explore and appreciate all its features Overall GTA 5 provides an expansive and immersive experience but its mature content and complexity should be taken into account before

"h1 Awesome Game But Installation Nightmare h1

This game is really fun and great and all but was an installation nightmare for me Fun story and open world so far But be warned when trying to install it may not go smoothly for everyone Overall if youre thinking of getting this game its worth it

PS Rockstar Games please invest some time into fixing your poopy launcher I shouldnt have to run things as administrator all the time or jump for 50 hoops just to get your launcher working Please yes Thank you"

Game Of The Year

What else can i say Its timeless Over 10 years worth of memories Returning in light of recent eventsBRING ON GTA VI 
"GTA Online is the worst online multiplayer experience ever It almost feels like a game such as GTA should never have online features Half the time I feel like I was in a boring dream Missions heists and what not take too long with redundant driving from one point to another and lack of vehicle spawn If your chopper blows up in the middle of the desert youre d o n e fucked 

Yes some deathmatches races and all that events can be fun but if I wanted to play those game modes Id rather play other games As for the heists the thing that gets you a lot of money quicker its like being tortured more painful than when Trevor tortured that dude For one connection errors are more common to encounter than the actual players who are willing to join the heist What worse is that once youve got some players ready and you finally get to hear the mission instructions your fellow crew mates would grief the fuck out of you with all that hack trainer or some shit Sure that sure sounds like fun The heistsmission are very long with the long drive and thousands of npcs to be killed so it makes sense if you need other players as they might help you travel faster and kill npcs faster Truth is you cant rely on other players for helping you because most likely theyd rather be trolls I know I can play with friends and family but they are smart enough to avoid this shit

Money is important So important that you need money to have fun in the game Some missionsheists requires you to buy some properties To earn money you should do contract mission or events these contract missionsevents dont even get you loads of cash Meanwhile the properties you need to buy are way too expensive Luckily these contract missionsevent can be done in solo however even so the missions are made for multiplayer so it takes so long Wait whats this oh you can buy money with money Thats right You want to buy these ingame properties to enjoy the additional missions but you dont like grinding for money because its boring Just give Rockstar your cash

Seriously I would prefer Rockstar to make dlcs to the main game for additional gameplay stories and ingame stuff than this online bullshit"

Well its a really nice game its not that short when i played it my first time my playtime was about 43 hours The game is not dead like GTA SA i mean the city is bustling with life there are a lot of NPCs and there is a lot of their models There is some few glitches and broken mechanics but the overall is great The side quests are nice too when you dont have anything left to do There are so many activities that you can do to diversify the game for me personally i like to play tennis its well made and realistic You should buy this game if you didnt already
it a good game
Why not

"VERY GOOD GAME 
DOWNLOAD AND PLAY"
Gta is a very fun game to play and enjoy with ur friends their is also many mods like LSPDFR you can play as a copswatmillitaryFbi and many more You cana also install FiveM and roleplay with other players in real time you can be a gang membermillitaryfbiswat policecivyou can also even havea  job this game fivem is very fun because the carssounds are very realistic this game evne has proximity chat Which means when ur very far from a player you cannot hear them like real life but when your close to them u can hear them better the closer you get  also Fivem is fun because you dont get a watned level by the cop npcs you get a wanted level by the real pollice players which means when you unalive a lot of cops you lose them unlike gta v with the cops the more you kill them ore they come an also you can roleplay robberys such as a bankgas station

"First time ever trying a GTA game  Bought this on sale cheap
Maybe its too old maybe im too old but a few minutes in I knew this wasnt for me   Uninstalled got a very quick refund  My thanks to Steam and Valve"
someone spawned in a whole bunch of money for me now im permabanned and cant do anything about it Rockstar wont undo my ban either
"Online mod is filled with hackersmodders that ruin gameplay Good luck reporting them as many have a mod that crashes your game should you click on report

Campaign and private matches with friends is fun"
r4eally fun with friends
great game
niec gaem me liek boobies
yes
the game of all time
Endless loading screens and more cheaters than money in Rockstars back account
I have no idea how this game is as popular as it is The game is essentially a terrible menu simulator the people that play it are all either cheating or toxic and there is little to no explanation as to what you should actually be doing If you do not have friends to play this game with do not get it as you will likely have a lessthanideal experience

"I never played the online stuff dont care for it and I think the absurd money it makes has really hurt not just Rockstar in terms of actual game development instead of just making shark cash bait but the industry as a whole 
However I cant deny that the singleplayer experience of the game is excellent Very memorable and enjoyable Not a lot of bad things to say in fact I usually end up replaying it every few years I say just go for it"

Rockstar is nothing but an ignorant company in the topics of their player base and how cheaters are almost in every single damn server of GTA Online Every day and even every minute they ruin peoples fun time and gameplay which makes GTA Online itself unbearable but ofcourse Rockstar games isnt so willing to put up an anticheat programme just because for whatever reason as if they claim that GTA Online and their player base is notsoimportant and just like they let go of Red Dead Online they are slowly letting go of GTA Online because their incompetence and hunger for money is higher than the values they give towards the game So if you are here for online get ready for a hot and ready disappointment at your monitor being delivered to you personally Because Rockstar Games letting people ruin their game They dont even give a shit about reports i have personally reported many cheaters sometimes even same guy over and over again for coming up to me later on and ruin my game or crash it

"GTA V Story Mode 55 Stars

 Story is epic each character has a lot of indepth individual stories about who are they  Gameplay from gunplay to driving a vehicle is enjoyable  Map size is okay  Game graphics beautiful from 2013 until this day

 But they should make your bought car not disappear when you leave it Instead it just returns to your garage

GTA Online 35 Stars

 uhhhh Grindy and a mess

 When I joined the public session mostly I was bombarded with people in chat advertising their mod menu or sometimes moderators jailing your character so it could not move ruining lobby sessions and business missions There were some friendly moderators that helped me with business missions Invite only session is better

 So back in the summer update when they gave GTA 5 free on Epic I grind business mission just selling cars and leveling up and character stats to profit    

 Mainly playing online just to have fun with friends playing Heist Or doing an online racestunt race and the new one a drift race"
fun to grind

"Very low expectations for GTA 6 after spending less than a month with this lightlypolished turd


OfflineStory mode is way too short and theres not enough story for each character They all just feel like sidecharacters with a little extra screen time What little of them is added to Online doesnt make up for this at all nor does all the extra side crap in story mode


Online is the real dumpster fire A lazy even more buggy stupid excuse for a cash grab built around a bunch of badlyimplemented good and bad ideas and designed to spread and induce toxicity and punish people for trying to get away from that crap Rockstar are abusing every mental manipulation they can to try to keep people playing but anyone who does so must just be desperate for something to do because it is boring AF playing the same crap for disproportionate effort vs payout in so many different forms getting griefed constantly in public lobbies no matter how peaceful you are and etc


Between this and the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition BS Rockstar has officially justified pirating their games but in reality everyone is better off just avoiding this bloated corporationfocused shadow of what was once a good game studio entirely Long live III VC SA IV because V killed GTA"
good game with much gratuitous violence
hill kookers
AMEI O PUTEIRO
b
its fun game and the world is great to mess around in and even better with the online bits The story was decent but the ending kinda just okay
Hacking makes online unplayable If you run into a hacker all you can do is leave that online session and go to another hacked session This is the first time I have ever requested a refund from steam Do not buy this if you want to play online 
this is my dream game
awesome game man 
nnbjnk
great game
good game
very good dont play online tho
sssss
ok
Love it
Game is pretty much useless now that I cant even log into it without Rockstar informing me that my Steam Account is connected to another unknown Rockstar Account
this game is my love
I cant
""
The original content is great and worth the while to sit down and play for some 150 ish hours but after that the new updates are sloppy in writing they lack any fun and interesting characters plot lines visuals and are generally bankrupt missions are drug out until they run you insane out of boredom jokes that dont land because they could never even fly id suggest you buy this game off a website that sells the keys for cheaper since the original value of 60 euro is just not there anymore
gud

"After completing Grand Theft Auto V on 2 console generations I got to say that the PC version is far more superior and the performance is way better than the PS4 or PS3 and Xbox 360

its epic
One of the most annoying worst online experiences even if you are part of the problem Basically Rockstar is never going to stop their hacker problem and they actually treated them to a special Christmas event And people can still do whatever they feel Playing this game online is like being a criminal basically Dont be a criminal kids There needs to be legal laws to ban rockstar from having and advertising these servers They are broken and unplayable Long loading times nobody who is a legit gamer plays this game online Everyone is no joke just made because my KD is 11000 players in 4000 D basically now the tables changed People cant admit they get mad when someone gets them over their skill Now they use hacks because the last person did So do not buy this game for online You will waste your time and rockstar will not do anything about it Been giving support tickets GTA V ONLINE SERVERS SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN NOW

Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece of openworld design storytelling and sandbox freedom Its immersive world complex characters and darkly humorous narrative provide an unparalleled playground for virtual crime sprees While its mature themes and occasional mission hiccups might deter some for those willing to dive into the gritty underbelly of Los Santos GTA V is an unforgettable experience that leaves a lasting mark long after the final credits roll Just remember with great power comes great responsibility and a healthy dose of explosives for when things inevitably get chaotic

 GAMEPLAY 
Living breathing sandbox Los Santos and Blaine County overflow with vibrant detail from bustling city streets to sunbaked deserts offering endless opportunities for exploration and mayhem
Three unforgettable protagonists Michael Franklin and Trevor are more than just playable characters theyre flawed complex individuals with motivations that twist and turn as the story unfolds
Cinematic storytelling From pulsepounding action sequences to darkly comedic exchanges GTA V delivers a rollercoaster ride of a narrative that rivals Hollywood blockbusters
Unparalleled online playground GTA Online extends the experience with a constantly evolving world of cooperative heists competitive showdowns and playercreated chaos

Mature often offensive content Violence nudity and strong language are abundant making GTA V unsuitable for younger audiences
Mission design can be uneven Some missions feel repetitive or frustrating occasionally breaking the narrative flow
Microtransactions in GTA Online While not paytowin some may find the optional ingame purchases for faster progression intrusive

"Its Grand Theft Auto 5 if it at this point you need explaining what that means then you even reading this review is pointless

Best game for cars and driving

"GTA online is pretty much unplayable on the pc unless you do private servers there is at least 1 or 2 modders hackerscheaters in every single lobby Some will give you free money but most will turn on god mode turn invisible and then automatically taze everyone on the server 10 timessecond so you cant move or theyll telport everyone on the server to them to kill them 

Even when the games not being ruined by cheaters its ruined by rockstars own bugs trying to quick join a heist will put you on a never ending loading screen more than half the time I had the most expensive vehicle disappear from my inventorygarage Gameis such a piece of garbage"

"IF YOU ARE HAVING THE Unable to download required Files From Rockstar Services ERROR PLEASE READ LAST PARAGRAPH

Played this game with a Friend with no issues for months then put it down and when i came back to it the other day i couldnt Play Online I kept getting the Unable to download required Files From Rockstar Services error I Issued a ticket with R and got a Bot Response TWICE in a row then after waiting a day or two and trying every fix i could think of R closed my ticket and didnt Issue any Response I DID end up fixing the error The simple fix stated below is the reason i am negatively reviewing R as opposed to this game although i do dislike the grievers this game promotes online which ruin it for everyone as they have made a game which requires these infuriating steps and offered a poor Customer Service Experience I have such taken to referring to R Lovingly as Fkstar for the Foreseeable Future

The Fix was as simple as going to OUTBOUND RULES in windows Firewall permissions and allowing GTAV"

"Grand Theft Auto V stands as a towering achievement in the world of gaming offering an openworld experience thats as exhilarating as it is expansive Set in the sprawling fictional city of Los Santos this game seamlessly blends action narrative depth and boundless exploration

From the moment you step foot into this virtual metropolis the attention to detail is staggering The city feels alive teeming with a diverse population bustling streets and a vibrant ecosystem that reacts to your every move The level of immersion is unmatched as you navigate a world that feels as dynamic and unpredictable as our own

But beyond its stunning visuals and vast open world its the intertwining stories of three distinct protagonists that elevate this game to greatness Michael Franklin and Trevor each bring their own flavor to the narrative offering a multifaceted perspective on the criminal underworld and their intertwining lives Their stories intertwine seamlessly providing a rich and engaging storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat

The freedom this game affords is unparalleled Whether youre causing mayhem in the city streets engaging in highspeed pursuits or simply soaking in the details of a sunsoaked skyline theres always something to do The breadth of activities from adrenalinefueled heists to leisurely rounds of golf ensures that boredom is never an option

Furthermore GTA Online extends the experience far beyond the singleplayer campaign allowing you to dive into a persistent multiplayer world Collaborate with friends in heists compete in races or simply revel in the chaos of the openworld sandbox with countless other players

In summary Grand Theft Auto V isnt just a game its a living breathing universe of its own Its blend of immersive storytelling boundless exploration and unparalleled freedom cements its place as a titan in the gaming industry offering an experience that continues to captivate and enthrall players worldwide"

i like hijacking cars and running over innocent pedestrians its great would recommend
Its a very good game and now i know why this game has a great story and still playable after 10 years Though there are some issues with gta online as you know there are many hackers in the lobby If Rockstar could just ban these hackers gta online experience would be great Overall this game is worth playing and paying
was actually able to play the game for a while before getting off for like 6 months when i try to log back in the initializing bar is in the bottom right and im just sitting waiting for hours dont get this game because if you log off for more than 6 months GTA 5 the game itself just breaks and  you cant play it and all i wanted to do was play story mode so i could get my moneys worth of the game now im just considering on refunding the game but i still want to play GTA 5 on pc if anyone knows whats happening pls comment i guess
This games is just nostalgic

"Broken outdated and addictive

Publisher and Devs are just trying to squeeze as much money they can out of you"
this shit bussin
Goated
"Grand Theft Auto Online the multiplayer counterpart to the iconic GTA series has unfortunately become a prime example of a game suffering due to profitdriven decisions by its publisher TakeTwo Interactive The experience in GTA Online feels less like a playerfocused venture and more like a relentless pursuit of monetization at the expense of player enjoyment

One of the glaring issues is the inordinate focus on microtransactions TakeTwo seems more interested in squeezing every last dollar out of players than delivering a balanced and enjoyable gaming experience The exorbitant prices for ingame items coupled with the grindheavy nature of the game make it clear that the primary concern is the virtual wallet rather than player satisfaction

Updates and new content often prioritize expensive ingame purchases rather than addressing core issues and improving the overall gameplay experience It feels like TakeTwo is pushing players toward spending real money to stay relevant in the game creating a sense of frustration and exclusion for those who may not be willing or able to invest additional funds

The rampant presence of hackers and modders further compounds the problem creating an environment where legitimate players are left to fend for themselves against unfair advantages Instead of addressing these concerns TakeTwos focus appears to be on releasing new moneymaking content neglecting the need for a fair and secure gaming environment

In conclusion the current state of GTA Online reflects a disheartening prioritization of profit over player satisfaction by TakeTwo Interactive The game has devolved into a grindheavy microtransactionladen experience that often leaves players feeling frustrated and alienated Its a stark reminder that a games success should be measured by more than just its financial gains"

"In the city of Los Santos a young hustler falls under the wing of a former criminal living a difficult retirement Circumstances lead to the pair to have to do a job to pay off a debt  a job which gets national coverage and draws unwanted attention from a former partner corrupt cops ruthless movie moguls rival gangs aggressive fitness fanatics and many others

I have played this game series on and off over the years but criminally did not play the former one based in Los Santos but instead rejoined with GTA4 a game I enjoyed but not one without its flaws The good news with V is that the game keeps the strengths of the fourth game but makes many improvements which produce a much more fun and enjoyable experience across many aspects The first thing to say is that the world of LS is technically amazing in terms of its attention to detail and beauty  it is hard to describe to people who decide they do not like these games but to see a glorious sunset from a hillside with perfect shadow effects and vegetation movement and know that someone designed and made this not just filmed it is something that hit me over and over throughout the game The map is enjoyably large with diverse landscapes and character and I still find great pleasure in just going around in it even if I have nothing specific to do

The story is solid enough for the game even if it is rather generic and overblown The characters are quite clichéd in some regards Michaels story for instance is not so imaginative and generally I found him the least of the characters Franklin is similar but covered by him being the intro character so I stayed close to him throughout Trevor is a wonderfully violent and funny character and his entrance is memorable and really shakes the game up The events of the story are necessarily overblown but this is part of the fun and generally I liked the flow to it The many supporting characters are great fun and the energy and color of it all does cover up for the fact that the story is not really that complex or engaging at times As it is though it is about events and setpieces and the game provides plenty of fun memorable missions admittedly as well as a handful of awful ones and in this way there are loads of missions to replay and enjoy and most importantly this game actually allows you to load them to do just that

Side missions add color and fun and although I do miss ongoing missions like the vigilante ones from IV there is still plenty to do The range of vehicles adds to this and I also enjoyed how much easier they are to drive than in the previous game Weapon customization and the range of them provide fun destruction although the police are a lot more aggressive in this game than in IV so it is harder to go on a rampage and make it last In theory the Online world offers endless gaming  I tried it for one evening and it was fun despite all the issues but the community seemed messed up and very reliant on having an existing group of players  it looks fun but Im just more of an offline player these days

Grand Theft Auto V is a great game even if you only play the days and days of content in the single player game Technically the game is astounding with its attention to detail and just the sheer beauty of the audio and visual design of the whole world The plot is solid enough to do the job while the characters main and supporting are colorful enough to engage while playing through missions which are mostly enjoyable and offer plenty of big setpieces that are overblown and fun"

"The online is an absolute joke Riddled with modding trolls who crash your game lock you in cages run around with god mode teleporting you around For every maybe 50 modders youll find one that isnt nefarious Every single online lobby has modding trolls in it and if youre lucky to find one without them it will only be a matter of time before one joins Rockstars solution Invite only sessions which turn online mode into just a buggy extension of the story mode

On top of that the latest chop shop update is riddled with soft locking bugs that require you to restart the game and start missions over again just to be able to complete them For one of the most profitable games in gaming history you would think they would hire some professional game developers but apparently theres not many competent coders in the gaming industry anymore I could write code at 13 years old more stable than this embarrassment 

Tldr If you want to play online just find an RP server to play in those server owners care about their private servers more than Rockstar does their own game"

Buy the game not the shark cards or criminal enterprise pack"
its really a facade to the people with lower end computers it promises a great experience for entry level pcs but in reality your gonna end up running a 28 fps adverage
You get to feel like a criminal and jaywalk

"Grand Theft Auto V A Timeless Triumph in Gaming Excellence

Rating 

Grand Theft Auto V stands as a towering achievement in the world of gaming a testament to Rockstar Games unrivaled ability to craft a virtual experience that transcends entertainment Even years after its initial release GTA V remains an absolute masterpiece continually drawing players into the vibrant and chaotic world of Los Santos

From the moment you step into the meticulously crafted city the level of detail is staggering Los Santos is a living breathing entity pulsating with energy and realism The games visuals are a feast for the eyes showcasing Rockstars commitment to pushing the boundaries of what is possible in an openworld setting The attention to detail from the bustling city streets to the serene countryside is nothing short of aweinspiring

But what truly elevates GTA V to legendary status is its narrative brilliance The intertwining stories of Michael Franklin and Trevor create a narrative tapestry that is as compelling as any Hollywood blockbuster The characters are richly developed each with their own motivations and quirks making them more than just protagonists  theyre complex flawed individuals you cant help but invest in

The heist missions a hallmark of the GTA series are the epitome of gaming excellence The level of strategic planning coupled with the freedom to execute plans in various ways provides a sense of agency rarely seen in other games Whether youre orchestrating a daring bank heist or engaging in highspeed pursuits the gameplay is a perfect blend of challenge and sheer fun

GTA Vs soundtrack is a work of art in itself The radio stations boast an eclectic mix of music catering to diverse tastes and the original score seamlessly complements the onscreen action The attention to audio detail from the roar of engines to the ambient sounds of the city further immerses players in the games world

The longevity of GTA V is also owed to its dynamic online multiplayer mode GTA Online This everexpanding world offers limitless opportunities for cooperative and competitive play ensuring that the Grand Theft Auto experience extends far beyond the confines of the singleplayer campaign

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V isnt just a game its a cultural phenomenon that has left an indelible mark on the gaming landscape Rockstar Games has crafted an experience that transcends its medium delivering a perfect blend of narrative depth visual splendor and engaging gameplay Whether youre a seasoned gamer or new to the series GTA V is an absolute mustplay  a timeless triumph that continues to redefine the possibilities of interactive entertainment"

"grand theft auto v the reason that my review took so long is because i always 100 my games before writing a review for them so here it is i guess
the story of grand theft auto v has aged very well after all these years and its nice to visit it after a while but unfortunately not everything else
so if someone installs the game and only plays through the main story and a few side missions its a very solid experience but the collectibles and the side missions have such a dated and a not fun design to them that really drag this game down
like the fact that the game doesnt tell you which stunt jumps are remaining or where is the alien piece and etc
and dont get me started on gta online i swear to god i never had a worst online experience in all of my years as a gamer and the fact that a lot of the achievements are from gta online just made the whole process so much more tedious 
i never want to touch gta online ever again 
i think the story is solid enough to justify buying this game but if you love your sanity dont go for completion or online achievements"

I have enjoyed playing every GTA game I have come across The story mode is incredibly engaging and the online version can be equally enjoyable if you find a private lobby away from the modders and hackers However due to the constant interference of modders it has become increasingly difficult to complete missions and enjoy the game For this reason I cannot recommend it to others looking for a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience
LESTER STOP CALLING ME
aaaa
no need to explain
LOL the game has released for 10 years and it still has many bug
This isnt just about violence It has depth in its story that you can only expect from rockstar It is based on America as everyone know

hhdfggffhh
What a bad game The dialogues are so incredible stupid and the handling feels so off all the time When it comes to the missions there is only ONE correct way to do them no freedom whatsoever But what bothers me the most is really the stupid characters and their unbearable dialogues I dont care if you are twelve Im going to rape you anyway was the sentence that made me quite this game at last Just what our society needs Even More antiheroes who idealize drugs abuse and the all consuming pursued of making money
very good

Ive played GTA ever since it was a thing My favorites were San Andreas and Vice City I bought this game about 10 years ago and never really played it through until my roommate started playing it through the Online version I had no idea what I was missing out on This game is utterly fantastic Rockstar really went all out when they developed this masterpiece You can do whatever you like in this game consequences included of course But thats where the charm comes from Jump in have fun run missions become an underworld crime lord and get away with it Its a nice step away from reality for a few hours at a time

"My 18 year old ask me to reinstall the game and in doing so I noticed that I had yet to review the game  We have at the time of this review over 320 hours play time on the PC with nearly double that on the PS4   Funny thing is that we have never even completed the story campaign or played on the online portion   The vast majority of the time was just my daughter and I making tons and tons of mayhem   Well more me making the mayhem and her going on joy rides

For years now she has asked me when GTVA 6 was coming out and she was so glad to hear that it was finally coming out in a couple more years  I dont care what people say I am glad for her that she will finally have a female antihero to play as  In the past we have always modded the game just so she could play as a female character   I tire of people saying a game is woke just because it has a female lead  Grow up and get with the current century is what I have to say and I am in my fifties so it isnt like I am a Millennial or Gen Z saying this   If you dont like the character being female do the opposite of what we did and mod the character to a male

Anyway it is amazing how much fun this game is just driving around and sightseeing even after all these years the game still holds up as a decent looking game  Rockstar put heart and soul into the game and it shows

By the way if you ever get a chance to meet Steven Ogg voice of Trevor in real life do it  The dude is hundred kinds of funny and a cool dude all around"

"I had to request a refund because I couldnt even get to the game 

Trying to launch the game starts a launcher where you have to create an account and give personal information That alone is very annoying but I went through the process and thought that was that but I was sorely mistaken After setting up an account and verifying my email the launcher asked for an activation code and it provided no information on where to get it I looked up online and apparently you can see this code if you log in with the created account on the rockstar website I tried logging in and I was met with the worst captcha I have ever seen

The captcha is very difficult you need to match randomly generated rooms with several objects to a blackandwhite map of the correct room layout That is already challenging by itself but the kicker is you have to do it 10 times So I did my best and submitted their captcha 10 times At the end it gave me the message That was not quite right and I had to start over

I tried a couple more times but in the end I gave up and asked for a refund

I dont understand why game publishers put these hoops to play their games I already paid you so just let me access your game ffs"

"At a discount I totally recommend this game It can be a fun bit Unfortunately it didnt quite hit the mark for me it becomes too repetitive I feel like I spent most of my time in the game driving around the city 

The characters lack depth appearing rather onedimensional Although theyre intended as satirical figures I found the critique of society lacking due to a lack of insightful storytelling The excessive violence and torture felt out of place lacking context and purpose devoid of any impactful consequences Some side missions were entertaining yet others felt mundane and offered little reward contributing to an overall weak storyline Despite moments of entertaining banter between characters there was a notable absence of character progression leaving them seemingly unchanged from the games start to near completion I stopped right before the final heist

Investing in properties within the game felt pointless the money spent never returns requiring an extensive grind to acquire them all which didnt appeal to me

Although there were enjoyable moments in the game there were also instances where playing it left me with a sense of discomfort or unease I wont delve into the portrayal of women in the game as objects or unable to exhibit ruthlessness However I found the inclusion of the therapist character puzzling Was it intended as satire Therapy remains taboo in many societies so why not explore that notion Why not play with societys perceptions of therapy Instead it seemed evident that the therapy sessions in the game were not genuine therapy but rather another aimless story arc leaving me questioning its purpose and significance 

As for the online mode it could potentially be enjoyable with friends However the high cost of items and the grind required were significant deterrents While the concept of owning businesses seemed promising the execution made it more of a chore than a pleasure The delivery missions were timeconsuming the process of checking supplies at businesses in person felt tedious and the excessive hours needed to play repetitive missions for incremental progress towards a new and improved business felt unreasonable"
Ye the online is kinda fun i guess

Needs bloatware to play Avoid Not sure why Valve even allows games like this that block paid purchases behind launcher Denying someone something they paid for is theft
siuuuuuu
"Rockstar hates its fanbase

No singleplayer content updates in a decade
In multiplayer its so tedious and lengthy to grind money for vehicles businesses and they do this on purpose so you will bend and buy Shark Cards for real money So naturally everyone just cheats and hacks for money or vehicles that they want Rockstar responded by adding the MK2 oppressor which made it so griefers can kill you freely time and time again

The game also has no anticheat so expect to be trapped in cages teleported and having your whole ass game bugged and crashed for making the mistake of joining a public lobby 

Game takes forever to load which makes it even more painful because 710 times you will error out be sent back to singleplayer then have to rejoin multiplayer whole process to launch the game 510 mins on good PCs

Cayo Perico is the only really valid option for earning good money which is a pretty cool heist but gets old grinding it time and time again I dont have a problem with grinding in games but when it revolves around driving 38 miles across the map to the same spots time and time again its just boring

at least they brought back beloved features from GTA 4 and Vice City like Vigilante missions oh wait actually nope it took them 11 years to even add cop cars you can own and still no vigilante missions

Will Rockstar learn from these mistakes in GTA 6 doubtful they make 25 million per day off Shark Cards why change a winning formula"

I liked this game a lot but the developed are dead set on minimizing as much enjoyment from it as possible For me my breaking point has been them showing us how fun this game could be with the cayo perico heist where you can make all the money you could want just for them to go back around and stomp it into the ground again because they wanted more money from sharkcards Not to mention the fact that they thought doing that was a better idea the fixing the rampant cheating problem This game has become a shell of what it used to be Its just a fat bloated pile of shit begging you for more and more money

Its GTA V omg
"Saw the GTA6 trailer was very impressed found out this was on sale for all of 10 including GTA Online Scooped it And I couldnt be happier

The game is over 10 years old as of this commentary and I never got to play GTA4 yet so its been an enormous gap since I played GTASA on the PS2 for reference Ive played since the very first GTA on the PS1 along with GTA2 GTA3 and GTAVC as well

The level of depth and immersion blew me away and would have had my teenage self floored because I played the older titles for their immersion The story was so much fun to unravel and I especially loved the Trevor character The sheer amount of things to do were so many that I probably wont be able to 100 this game any time soon But what really struck me was how faithful they were to referencing their older titles including a car from GTA2 which is like the bastard child of the franchise it seems

Its all the fun and frantic openworld destroyeverything GTA was always known for with a massive city and a more rural county chock full of weapons to play with a load of cars of all different types that dont look repetitive after a while new minigames and RPG elements

The only sad thing is that unlike GTASA they had to remove the cities of San Fierro and Las Venturas because that would have just made the world map so immense that this game would probably be so much bigger to install than it already is now Still with how deep they have been going plus what I saw with the GTA6 trailer who knows if theyll make some kind of altUSA travel system to do this sort of thing and interconnect them along with Liberty City and Vice City Im looking at you GTA Online

100 recommend Its the 5th major installment of a beloved franchise and it really delivers its entertainment especially if youre into openworld immersion"
From a singleplayer perspective the game is nothing short of an excellent experience the story isnt the best in the series but is a great parody of modern america Each of the three characters have their own narrative that collides with each other to feel unique and relevant to the main plot The choice of endings are obvious and not necessarily compelling which leaves a half baked finish to the game But the first 23 of the game have excellent character development and writing The open world is great but feels empty Its more or less a travel hub to go from point A to point B but has a good level of detail and almost every part is used productively The online portion of the game sucks and is boring using the same open world as single player with very few things different or interesting to see and do Unless you have a small army of people to play with multiplayer is a cash grabbing joke The whole of the single player is what holds up to this day 9010
Rockstar your decision to require a social club account even to play story mode is dumb as S H I  T T Was hoping to come back from a hiatus but ended up uninstalling Wont be buying 6 Done with this money grubbing nonsense

"EDIT After playing all this time on GTA online ive come to the conclusion that this game is absolutely killed by hackers and mod menus GTA online does not feel like a safe game to play and for that reason I cannot recommend paying for this product
I personally like playing in closed sessions enough for it to be playable but if I had known how bad this hacking issue was I probably never would have paid 14 bucks for the game
Any time I am in a public PC session I have distortion effects on my screen am being teleported all over the map or am being bothered in some other way by a hacker
They will make you randomly explode when walking invert your screen and basically play god while rockstar only bans those who abuse the in game currency and have no care for the well being of their players or the experience they have online
Great single player game absolutely horrible online experience and it has made me realize that I need to see this fixed when GTA 6 comes out or i will not be purchasing it


Been a few years since ive played GTA V and last time it was on a ps4 coming back now in 2023 its almost like a new game online in some ways
Very good game overall and honestly its still worth 60 bucks even after 10 years of its original release date
Fun solo fun with others and lots to do either way with what is still one of the most immersive cities in gaming even after a decade"

"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME

So not so recently Rockstar are slowing down and probably going to stop handing updates out to PC version of this game so if you really want to play go and play on a console while they still get updates

Now why you shouldnt buy it really at all Imagine this game is what we think of when we recycle a bottle it get crushed down a few bits of extra glass gets mixed in from somewhere and then turned into a new bottle But at the core its basically the same bottle This is every single GTA update Every one is recycled content Ooo new mission added Its basically drive shoot a few people look for a tiny thing not marked on the map drive miles back rinse and repeat Want to earn good money Either cayo or agency is your best bet which would be fine but every damn mission is the exact same All youre doing is the same thing over and over It doesnt even feel like grinding it just feels like soul sucking stuff

Rockstar are the worst This game places first for most popular and most profitable game in the world Breaking most records ever set What do they do in return Add subscription services nerf money making methods like cayo prioritise consoles over pc because Rockstar earn more from consoles than from PC and increase the prices of everything while also nerfing vehicles and other things I didnt even mention the fact they removed over 100 vehicles from the store only to make it so that GTA subscribers can get them The worst part It almost feels like a cult You mention Rockstar is bad and have no shortage of evidence of this and then you get all these Rockstar supporters coming out of the woodwork telling you how youre wrong and Rockstar is better than god

Yes I have nearly 1000 hours in this game and yes I still play from time to time but this is me telling you do not waste your money on this game on PC Probably dont waste money on this game at all

Also Rockstar dont care The game is full of modders and racist people and they dont do anything about it Honestly one of the worst gaming companies going

TLDR Dont buy on PC  Rockstar bad  Everything sucks"

"GTA V is a very amazing game especially Director Mode though i am sad about the fact that on January 30th i will no longer be able to play due End Of Support for Windows 7 8  81
Which honestly makes no since as the game is still supported on Xbox 360 which is way older than these versions of windows but i guess everything comes to an end am i right
Other than that this is one of the best games ive ever played cant wait for GTA VI and hopefully it will be available for windows 7 8  81 but most likely wont be so i hope ill have windows 9 or above by 2025"

Beast game if you like to get in a lot off of cop chases and rob places but need a good computer

Super underated game
Yah know its your classic rouge like dungeon crawler Uhhhhhh I really like longsword paladin build but Ive heard that people do well with a rogue type build The perk system is very well fleshed out I cant explain how it feels like I grow a year older with every point I invest I really liked the side quest when Tiny Tina killed Ralof The Steve Carrell cameo was really cool he came on all like im the joker baby and then blowded up some buildings Ive never played GTA San Andreas Shoutout Full Throttle energy drink After enjoying some playtime everyone should take a brief moment to step outside to your nearest 711 or whatever boonk ass gas station you have around you and grab a nice cold delicious Full Throttle Its the perfect thing to quench your thirst on a steamy hot day as well as give you that nice boost of energy I find that it pairs well with a 6 milly upper decky zinneas and ferb and a brand new pack of newport golds to create the most delicious and palatable meal Enjoy space coyboys

Probably my favorite game ever made I hope GTA 6 matches or exceeds the love I have for this game
like
Why did I moved here guess its just the community
this game is the best game ever and gta g is never coming out
fun
its gta
super
100 play this game best purchase ever
Its GTA itll be great no matter what
The online game play most part of the game is to travel to a long distance which will take around 10 mins and do some work like the part which you will feel like real playing either killing or sneaking or something like that for around 1 min only The same thing repeats for each and every mission The heist setup is same  You will be asked to travel for most part of the game Worst online setup Im fed up with this Even though there are many ways to travel it is irritating to travel for the most part of the game
fun
gud
This is the best GTA game to date so far Probably will be the second best once GTA VI comes out
worth every single rupee

very nice game im waiting a new winter update
The game is great even 10 years after launch But good God what on earth is up with with this puzzle solving verification 20 puzzles that takes many minutes and you have to get all options right to be able to redeem a code after solving other puzzles The nightmare goes on for at least 30 minutes Fix this
"An amazing game no doubt People always say how the remastered is barely different from the old ps3 but I have played on a ps3 and let me tell you theres a drastic difference specifically the graphics which people say at least the people I know are barely changed I see many differences in shapes many differences in contrast 

My 2 gripes Modders are a big thing in this game expect to run into one or two a day Also some cutscenes have little to no work put into them meaing that they are still good but Rockstar apparently forgot to remaster certain parts But dont worry you wont see it often Probably at most once or twice throughout your entier playthrough of the game"
YoWhats up Homies
just good
My 14 year old self has finally achivied the dream of owning and being able to play this game Ill come back in the future when the same happens with GTA VI
No review required  amazing game and is perfect for the steam deck 1010
best game ever made and i am willing to pay 1000 for gta 6
tttpig
ha npc go boom
i recondmend this game to people who like to rp and shii
This is one of the incredible game which I had played ever The graphics are realistic and you can experience the whole map of Los Santos and the missions are also interesting I had played all the series of GTA And believe me this game is incredible which is made by my favourite company Rockstar Game I would highly recommend to play the GTA 5 game
It is funny and the most realistic game you will get
strip clubbbbbbbbbbbbbb
Fun as flip dude
hands down one of the best games ever made

Kept myself from paying GTA 5 for 10 years but damn it was a good game
fun
"GTA V has generated 8 Billion Dollars in revenue

For reference Barbados has a GDP of 56 Billion 

Fiji has 49 Billion"
Still a lot of fun after so many years
man wtf
gooooooooood
Classic
its fun and open world
"honestly this made me hyped for GTA VI since itll just be this with better graphics and an updated map and vehicleweapon roster

I wouldnt rate this anything over a 710 due to the fact rockstar kept selling this for 10 years and though it was acceptable They only updated the GTA Online mode so Ill give it a 9210"
"The game would be great if it allowed me to play I have played this game before for a good while on my Steam account when I purchased it But then at some point it went free on Epic Games then I picked it up there After I tried it out there I missed my save from Steam and the achievements When I came back the Rockstar Social Club says that I cant use my account here because I already have a account on Epic even though I made it here first
Point is Rockstar support said they couldnt help and Steam that I cant refund so now I have a unplayable game which just became a locked trash bin where my money was thrown"
people cheat but funy
shit ass
ignore the grind play the game
asssssssssssssssssssssssss
They removed everything fun from online  All you can do is the boring repetitive missions  Wanna have some fun in an open world  Nope not allowed  We built this detailed world and all the NPC responses but no you cant go in there
gta v is super cool
One of the best gtas the online is great iv been playing the same character sense 2014 on my xbox 360 and the creators had the forethought to character transfer making it so i didnt waste my time ill miss this game when its gone
fdfdfdsfsdf
like how the game is still the same from when i originally bought it for my xbox 360 back in 2015 only thing is that the driving movement is shitty
This game made me horny over tonya

perfect game
"This game sucks Utterly I thought this was TripleA 100 GB of garbage

First of all why the hell do I need a Rockstar account to launch the game Im not playing online this shit should be opt out

Second of all to even log in to my Rockstar account I have to go through multiple captchas that will fail if you get even one answer wrong that consist of 1618 rounds of advanced spatial matching or 10 seconds of audio that you have to categorize

Third of all it wont even launch without 5 minutes of loading on a R symbol just to tell me that the game has already been launched before quitting Useless

Fourth of all get rid of the dog shit launcher No game has EVER benefited from a launcher save for perhaps MInecraft where you need multiple profiles for different versions and mods

I expect an AAA game to launch and work out of the box What did I get Half an hour of absolutely nothing This game has been out for 10 years and yet somehow it still needs work"
such a good story and they nailed the driving physics The graphics have aged so well too this is one of the greatest games ever made
its ight
Its GTA V speaks for itself at this point
great game loved this growing up
Game is very Fun just be cautious oh people who like to grief people
stressful and soo many hackers but nvm its fun tbh
The GOAT
It a really fun game you can enjoy and play with your friends and have a nice time
very cool

Rockstar continues to make absolute bangers I write this review shortly after the GTA6 trailer has been released After playing this game for years on multiple systems i still find new things to do here and there new ways to cause chaos or new encounters And thats just in the singleplayer mode GTA Online is constantly getting updates and adding things to do or things to buy You wont find another game that does what GTA does in this capacity
I think everyone knows about this game so yeah go ahead buy it its amazing

If you are a gamer and have not played this game you deserve death
"THE ONLINE IS TOO FRUSTRATING AND A MONEYGRAB

The singleplayer is an ok a regular gta game story 8 to 10 hours of play maybe a bit more where its ok till you have mission to earn money but when you finish them its a problem to earn unless u go trought all the trouble of doing the investments in shares in the ingame interenet before the heists which is a PITA you need to do with a youtube guidethere are singleplayer cheats but not the money cheat like if the developers wanted you to feel poor and frustrated

online its just a nightmare it feels like a work but sorry im here to play not to work or i would have stayed extra hours at a real job you start with nothing and you are going to get killed by other players a thousand times untill you get in private game to advance with some online missions and earn something so u can buy the basic weapons but some missions cant be done without players in the game so you are forced to play with griefers people that will purposelly ruin your mission because you cant literally do nothing against them when you start for lack of equipement and cheaters which has filled the game and makes planes rain over u or just crashes the game spawning too much stuff or run around in godmode fucking everything up and not only that it takes u soo much time to earn with missions that is as frustrting as a real job you dont like and when you buy one of the basic things that you need to protect yourself from other players you are back to zero unless u buy the in game money with real money  or u are lucky enough to find a hacker that drops money on you but guess what if someone gives u money he is porbably gonna be banned and u too but if you cheat without givingtouching the money no problem no bans u can crash servers no one cares       

i have been playing for a few years and i have seen those problems only getting worst 12275h of play almost all online and more than 34 of it was just tring to earn ingame money without having fun to buy what i needed i totally understand why cheaters are growing

I tell you people dont buy this game and dont buy the next one from this developer they dont deserve your money this shiny garbage has been made to suck either money out of you or all of your free time and patience the next one will be no differentdont feed the sharks people or more will comeand no more fun games will be made just frustrating moneygrabs that looks appealing"

VERY YUM GAME

"biWhy did I move here Guess its because Steam You see screenshots artwork review discussions and guides So I bought it this year and Ill upload everything I have in mindib

I rarely play the story mode so I just go directly to Online mode to play with friends doing heist and stuff But after I bought it on Steam I decided to play the story mode Though I didnt finish all the random events  Strangers  Freaks GTA Vs story amazed me Each mission Each dialogue Each moment is absofuckinglutely GradeA 3 protagonists with their lifestuffproblems to tell A gangbanger a father formely bank robber and a fucking psychopath yet loyal become involved in a series of dangerous missions and heists all while dealing with a dangerous group
list
Franklin with his desire to become something more  make something of himself which now he become a successful entrepreneur  multimillionaire in GTA Online The Contract Its funny to see Franklin  Lamar doing their chitchat His best lines is always biWhatib

Michael is a successfully retired  wealthy criminal that wanted to live a peaceful life with his family in Los Santos but slowly turns into a living nightmare His best lines biYou forget a thousand things every day pal Make sure this is one of emib

Trevor I dont know what to say but hes the fucking aggressive one But I gotta say hes very loyal  respects all those close to him Trevors first introduction include Johnny from GTA IV TLAD and the moment where Johnny is beaten up till dead by Trevor One of Trevors best and funniest lines for me is when he is with Michael and tells him that he kidnapped Madrazos wife biWhat kind of fucking animal do you take me for No I didnt kill him But I did kidnap his wifeib
list
GTA IV also had 3 protagonists but they were separated yet had one connected plot while GTA V all in one standalone game and whats new is each protagonist has their own colours 

Its cool that GTA V has many awesome features The main story now has playable heist missions convertible cars can retract and deploy their top covers weapons remain in the inventory after player died or busted all the weapons are stored in inventory instead of replacing them random events appeared randomly throughout San Andreas and 3 protagonists in the same mission allowing you to switch characters during the mission

Above all giving me a GradeA experience a place with many activities Online mode to have fun with friends and is still getting new content to this day this year is Chop Shop and spoilerit gives you patient report after finishing the storyspoiler"
Finally got something other than my PS3 to play GTAV and I can say this is 100 times better No lag no modders but I couldnt transfer my old account 
One of the best
its awsome

Good
The best game ever

"The storysingleplayer mode is one of the best games in the genre and while its difficult to mod there are some fun mods like LSPD for singleplayer that let you play as cops or SWAT  

The official online gets a lot of hate but honestly its not that bad these days I only learned this when I started playing again recently but last year they made some major changes that have reduced the frequency of griefers in public lobbies as well as made some MASSIVE changes to the grind You can now run just about any mission and heist prep on a private lobby meaning you are effectively 100 safe from cheaters or random griefers when running these missions This has effectively nullified most of the grinding as the only thing preventing you from farming gun running missions before was griefers and you can easily get millions in a day for doing practically nothing through gun running missions uninterrupted by players trying to kill you with jets"
VERY GOOD GAME

"I have loved every GTA game I bought it on release for PS1 GTA3 Vice San Andreas on PS2 
Single player is excellent and worth buying if you havent already experienced it

However GTA online for PC is absolutey fcked and a fentanolfilled dumpster fire rolling down Vinewood Hills 
So much so that R has already abandoned GTA6 2 years before its release on PC

If youre buying GTA5 online then its probably so you can play it modded anyway or want to RP 

If youre not cheatin youre not tryin Eddie Guerrero

GTA5 on console may only be on lifesupport with GTA6 around the corner sucking up most of the development team but at least its actually still getting support Come join me on PS5 for a strikegoodstrike much better experience"
I like to pit manuever my friends in  races

No complaints everyone loves GTAV

Good
Best Game ever even though its been a long time since it released this is the best game i ever played I regret for not buying the game much earlier
cheaters
Its a great game with a rich suspenseful story Great memorable characters Personally I dont play online that much mods keep me entertained in single player If youre on the fence buy it on sale Well worth it
Been having this ACTIVATION KEY REQUIRED issue when starting GTA 5 game have the CDKEY is also useless it says ROCKSTAR ACTIVATION CODE ALREADY IN USE Read a lot of complain regarding this same problem on GTA 5 community but seems like theres no solutions Thumbs DOWN for ROCKSTAR GAMES
"The tennis game with Amanda was intense and I lost This game taught me that no mater how many advantages you get your spouse will take them all back before crushing your dreams I have never felt such disappointment as when Micheal lost over five advantages to a woman that he coached and is now better She must have been Serena Williams in hiding and she blew her cover This game proves that no matter how many times you want to win there will always be a professional athlete hiding  in your daily life ready to ruin it forever

In conclusion 1010 game The tennis courts did not get rained out"
I want to torture wade for being an absolute nerd
VERY FUN
Its the best game in the world hands down 
the game is unplayable its full of hackers and Rockstar aint doing nothing

GOOD GAME
"h1Im not a criminal Im a entrepreneurh1
iSee you in GTA 6 if im alive theni

Grand Theft Auto V the latest instalment in the controversial yet wildly popular franchise delivers just that First released in 2013 the game has since been remastered and optimised for PC offering players a chance to experience this sprawling crime epic in stunning 4K resolution and 60fps 

Set in the fictional city of Los Santos GTA 5 provides a vivid recreation of Southern California and all the seedy underbelly it encapsulates The game offers a scathing and satirical take on the American Dream through its interweaving story of three criminals from very different walks of life

h2Storylineh2
As you progress through the game you are confronted with moral dilemmas and complex relationships in a world filled with crime corruption and the constant pursuit of power

What sets GTA 5 apart is its unparalleled attention to detail and the sheer scope of its openworld environment Los Santos evokes the feeling that it is a living breathing city bustling with pedestrians traffic and countless activities to engage in You could participate in street races play a round of golf enjoy a bike ride along the coastline or visit a strip club

GTA 5s story mode is a mammoth task with any one of the characters  Michael Franklin or Trevor  providing enough narrative for an entire game Combined they offer an intricate plotline with the highest standard of writing Once introduced you can freely switch between these characters each with personality traits and strengths

Franklin a streetwise hustler with a good heart can drive in slow motion Michael in witness protection tries to leave his criminal past behind Trevor is an unpredictable and volatile character who thrives on chaos

h2Gameplayh2
players can engage in various forms of gameplay such as completing missions participating in heists and exploring the open world

h3Shooting Mechanicsh3
While the base shooting mechanics have held up reasonably well since 2013 there are now thirdperson cover shooters that feel more fluid However GTA 5s shooting is still immensely enjoyable

h3Missionsh3
With multiple approaches to complete objectives you can tailor missions to your preferred playstyle Whether employing stealth direct confrontation or strategic planning the diversity of options ensures that gameplay never feels repetitive or monotonous

The variety of missions and mechanics guarantees that players remain engaged and excited You may enact a meticulously planned heist engage in intense gang warfare or embark on an adrenalinefueled chase sequence

h3Customisationh3
Players can shape unique experiences by changing outfits customising vehicles or exploring the openworld environment The plethora of choices for players adds replayability even after completing the main story

h3Open Worldh3
Players are granted almost total freedom to explore the vast metropolis of Los Santos and the surrounding countryside

Driving through the city evokes a palpable sense of place with responsive vehicle handling and collision physics creating an authentic experience whether navigating dense traffic in a sports car or offroading in a 4x4 Piloting aircraft opens up new vistas from scenic coastal flights to heartpounding aerial stunts The open waters surrounding the city are equally inviting to explore by boat or submarine

An astonishing array of side activities are scattered worldwide from recreational pursuits like golf tennis and cycling to more illicit diversions Stranger encounters introduce memorably eccentric characters and side missions with compelling selfcontained stories Collectibles like letter scraps and spaceship parts encourage exploration while revealing more about the world and characters but no one knows this

h3Driving Mechanicsh3
The driving mechanics of GTA 5 are unrivalled and constantly comparing other openworld driving games to GTA games like Just Cause Watch_Dogs and Saints Row just to name a few doesnt even come close to the pure satisfaction I get from the multitude of vehicles I have at my disposal and how vastly differing they all feel to navigate through the streets of Los Santos

h2Stunning Visuals for 2013h2
Everything from the character models to the buildings and terrain is meticulously detailed3 The lighting and particle effects are also remarkably realistic showcasing beautiful sunrises and sunsets and how dust kicks up from offroad driving These visuals combined with the seamless transition between the city and the open countryside make exploring the world a visually arresting experience

h3Cinematic Soundtrackh3
The original score for GTA 5 was composed to create tension during action sequences and a sense of ambience while free roaming or completing mundane tasks The game also features licensed music spread across 15 radio stations including hiphop rock and country genres Players can simply cruise down the freeway and enjoy the scenery while listening to their favourite tunes

h2Onlineh2
After nearly a decade on the market GTA 5 Online remains a polarising experience For all its ambition and scale the game struggles to balance engaging openworld gameplay with an incentive structure that pushes players toward griefing and other toxic behaviour Though recent updates have aimed to curb the worst excesses of the community the problems run deeper in the very framework of how GTA 5 Online functions 

If you can find a group of likeminded players there are glimpses of the promised fun and hijinks But for most GTA 5 Online is a cautionary tale of how even the most sprawling virtual worlds can feel empty when not built with community in mind You may enter with an open mind ready for adventure but leave with a sobering reminder of the darker impulses that emerge when there are no consequences For a game that holds up a mirror to society its a reflection we may not wish to see

h2Conclusionh2
Overall Grand Theft Auto V is an impressively ambitious and complex game that pushes the envelope of openworld gaming and storytelling The massive scope of its gameplay and intricate story should satisfy even the most hardcore GTA fans While not without its flaws and controversies GTA V is a technical and creative marvel that provides hours of entertainment and escapism 

Suppose you want to immerse yourself in a satirical take on modern culture with engaging characters and nonstop action In that case youll find it hard to beat this sprawling crime epic With so much to see and do in the world of Los Santos GTA V stands out as one of the most compelling openworld experiences in gaming"

Game requires admin rights  Launcher requires admin rights  Game requires Steam to run with admin rights  Even with all rights granted the game is perpetually stuck in a loop where Steam launches Rockstar launcher windows flags that as suspicious asks if I want to allow it to make changes to my device I reluctantly click yes and am greeted with the Rockstar launcher window where I have to click launch from Steam uhh I literally just launched from Steam  This brings up an error window that says it failed to launch  Verifying game files does not solve this problem  Ive owned the game for 9 days and have had this issue 3 times already  I dont play online Im only trying to play story mode but the game no longer launches  Steam refused my refund since Im over 2hrs but save yourself the troubleif you dont already own this old game dont buy it here  Or maybe even at all
You can drive fast and make big explosions

Online is full of modders who grief other players for no reason and rockstar dont seem to do anything about it The whole online part of the game is just an endless grind but if youre not happy with it you can always pay real money to get ingame cash lol
"Great game but terrible company that lies to you Or just simply scams you 
Single player mode requires internet connection They say you need it once to activate but after 2 days being offline traveling game wont launch I dont care about multiplayer I want TO PLAY ALONE 
Now Im waiting for Rockstar launcher to update for 2 hours on crappy mobile internet for no reason since I dont need that stupid launcher 
You basically pay for crappy experience while pirates have it better for free
If buying isnt owning since I cant play it whenever I want pirating isnt stealing"

This game is UNPLAYABLE because of all the modders Dont bother Also to all of you dipshits that have enough time on your hands to grief people with fucking god mode on I hope you all die of dick cancer Fuck you
yes
This game is really amazing the story is pretty good Although I did accidentally corrupt my save file  GTA Online is really good when you arent getting hunted by high level players I have made friends with people who do private lobbies with me to host high paying robberies so I can get cool cars The one thing I have to complain about is the modders I ran into one and he said wanna see something cool so I said yea and he made me go from level 10 to level 105 I do admit it was my fault It really messed me up because I had so little money for such a high level Besides that I think the game is good

"Ive been playing this game for about 23 years a majority of the time i play this game i have to play in friends only lobbies
My experiences consist of getting locked out of my online account locked out of gta v for 3 days couldnt even play story mode spawn trapped in passive mode prevented from leaving the game and closing the window because of spawn camping lagged out of the game my internet taken offline falsely reported because modders and hackers got mad at me locked out of all of my cars even the cars in my garage and businesses being constantly targeted for some reason even while hopping lobbies to get away i get ddosd and booted offline for killing a modder with a 1000 bounty crashed for going after their bounty locked in a cage while in passive and set on fire and cant escape even in death prevented from switching lobbies to escape them while they keep spawn camping me i could drive around do nothing and still get kicked off the game even playing in story mode ill get kicked out of the game and another thing making money in friends only lobbies only for it not to save due to connection issues and when i try to in a public session i just get targeted and lose all my money anyway so whats the point All of these experiences are from dealing with modders and hackers in the game slowly day by day its becoming less enjoyable for me to keep playing As of December 27th 2023 I cant log into gta v at all to play the game that i paid for"

"Grand Theft Auto V A Tale of Two Realities  A Stellar Campaign Overshadowed by Online Chaos

My experience with Grand Theft Auto V has been a rollercoaster of emotions swinging between awe and frustration While the singleplayer campaign is undeniably cool and engaging the online portion of the game has left a bitter taste in my mouth due to the rampant hacking issues that plague the experience

Lets start with the positive aspect the campaign Rockstar Games has crafted a narrative masterpiece with an engaging storyline diverse characters and a sprawling openworld that begs to be explored The singleplayer experience is a testament to the studios prowess in storytelling and game design providing players with a captivating journey through the criminal underworld of Los Santos

However the real allure of Grand Theft Auto V lies in its online mode Its a shame that Rockstar Games seems to turn a blind eye to the overwhelming hack scene that has infested the online realm Hackers run rampant and their presence transforms what should be a thrilling multiplayer experience into a chaotic and frustrating mess From money hacks to invincibility cheats the online portion of the game feels like a lawless Wild West where legitimate players are left to fend for themselves against the onslaught of malicious exploits

The sad truth is that Rockstar Games despite their immense resources and player community feedback has not done enough to rein in the hack scene across all their games This negligence not only undermines the integrity of the online experience in Grand Theft Auto V but also casts a shadow over the multiplayer aspects of their other titles Its disheartening to see a company of such stature failing to address a persistent issue that has been affecting their player base for far too long

As much as the campaign showcases Rockstars brilliance the allure of the online world is where the real fun is at The fact that this experience is marred by the unchecked proliferation of hackers is a major letdown Until Rockstar Games takes decisive action to curb the hack scene and create a more secure online environment Grand Theft Auto Vs online mode will remain a frustrating and unfulfilling playground for those seeking genuine multiplayer enjoyment"

Ive played the gta 5 story mode on my xbox one a bit long ago i think this upgrade to my gaming pc is mid although you can adjust your graphics settings  Peformance is kind of better I think this upgrade to pc is small for me So I dont think its good to buy the game all over on pc and ps5 If you already bought the game you dont need to upgrade Anyways the story is amazing and great CHOOSE DEATHWISH

This game needs to be re optimized so that players playing on older hardware can still enjoy the game as well  it sucks that i can run the story mode perfectly but when i try to play GTA online my CPU is overworked and can t run the game at a consistent 60 fps
yippee
this game has been out for ages and ive probably sunk thousands of hours between xbox 360 and pc the game has gotten progressively worse with each update the game used to be simple heists and gangbangs and now its become a game where the grind to get money has basically turned into a 9 to 5 job it went from lets do a heist or lets rob this gang to well looks like i need to resupply my bunker so i can sell it for money i can use to upgrade my bunker so it can produce more stuff to sell from each supply run the game has fallen from grace and with the recent deletion of some of the most iconic cars ive finally had enough hopefully they make the next installment worth my time and money but i fear this series is over

"Definitely a must play since I was a kid playing GTA III Vice city and San Andreas was the only way of experiencing some sort of reality in games along with the feeling you can do whatever you want

Story 1010  the back and forth between Michael and Trevor with a side of Franklin with the San Andreas vibe is awesome
Gameplay  810  would like a bit more challenge with the shooting mechanics
Graphics  1010  for a 10 year old game it looks stunning Wish it had an enhanced edition with RT"
good game _

"Playing this game was like having a conversation with a brick walltedious unresponsive and it left me feeling pretty solidly unimpressed The storyline Id have had more emotional investment watching paint dry And dont get me started on the characters They were about as memorable as yesterdays news
Ive seen more intuitive gameplay in a game of blindfolded tag with a group of cats And bugs Oh boy its a bug buffet Glitches everywhere like the game was sponsored by a techsavvy insect population
In summary this game is a bit like the Titaniclots of hype but ultimately it left me feeling like I was sinking into a sea of disappointment Save your money buy a plant at least they respond when you water them"

"the game wont allow u to bring ur progress form xbox or playstation making u grind the whole game again just the story mode is amazing and will always be the best story rockstar has made
so should u get the game yes if ur new but if joining for consle no its better to keep playing on consle"
Ive spent over 2 weeks on console and it is a terrible experience for me because the agony you have to go through just a heist setup
fun

Um yeah Its super fun way ahead of its time The only problem is that after finishing the campaign there are no more heists or things like that
"10 blood
10 boobies
10 drug dealing
10 drinking
10 idk gang rap
50 driving recklessly and not getting fined for it

great game tho"
good game 18
its the best
W
Its as fun as GTA 4
Its insane how busted the UI and matchmaking is for a game thats been out for a decade and extremely profitable Ive spent hours queuing just to play a single mission
best game ever made
GTA is a fantastic series and will continue to be You can virtually do anything you want considering how old it is Cant wait for GTA VI to come out
boobies
A lot of stuff to do and super fun
only 10ish years to finnish
"Well worth picking up by now if you havent already for the single player But the multiplayer is still riddled with bugs and full of hackers Online is fun and has lots of missions and things to do but is completely overshadowed by the few downsides that being the game is still full of bugs especially online and be prepared to be stuck in a deathloop as the hackers spawn kill you time and time again 

Do better Rockstar"

I have not really played any video games for thirty years  A friend shared a few games with me recently and well here we are   WOW   GTA V has my mind blown Im certain that most people are used to the speed aggressive action and the controllers with dozens of buttons and vibration features but beyond all that is an insanely entertaining way to spend some time  Im so impressed with the story line and the game play that Ive barely been able to appreciate the hard work and talent expressed by the graphicswhich are otherworldly when compared to Metroid Shinobi Contra etc  In short I cracked open a door and babystepped back into an awesome world that all started with GTA V  Highly recommended thanks for taking the time
Outstanding game

"Gameplay  810
Whilst some people may dislike the Rockstar gameplay formula as it certainly isnt for everyone I like it and it has made me come back to the story missions of this game about 3 times across all the platforms that I have played it on now The gun play in this game is satisfying for me as the guns really feel like they have power behind them Driving mechanics are fun and easy

Story  610
I wasnt too interested for most of the story and whilst there were some cool mission based around the story and some funny moments in the cut scenes it was mainly the gameplay that kept me playing

Graphics  710
The graphics of this game still hold up quite well today and Im sure they will for a while There are little details in some models that make the game world feel real and like there are many moving parts to each object Explosion and fire effects still look good and are satisfying to watch

Performance  910
I had some performance issues when I first started playing this game on PC but I have put that down to driver issues as they have disappeared since

Online  610
Personally the online never really interested me much but I think that it is mainly down to the fact that I dont have a group of friends that I can play it with to properly get into it and that would keep me coming back There is plenty to do in the online for people who like that sort of stuff though I just personally prefer single player games

Overall  910
If you havent played this game yet then I would recommend that you do so before GTA 6 releases within the next 58329 years"
so fun i love it

money hungry company that doesnt really care for its player and the online system is awful
I never thought Id be allowed to own this game but now that I can I must say that even after all of these years it is a masterpiece in every way possible and continues to prove to me that games do hold up nicely even a decade after launch Although online has its flaws with modders on pc I really dont have anything bad to say about the game Im genuinely so excited to see what rockstar has in store for us with GTA 6

A Modern Gaming Masterpiece GTA V Review Rating  After investing a staggering 793 hours into Grand Theft Auto V I can confidently say that it is an absolute gaming masterpiece Rockstar Games has once again delivered an unparalleled openworld experience that surpasses all expectations The level of detail in Los Santos is mindblowing Every street corner building and NPC feels alive and vibrant creating an immersive environment that constantly begs to be explored The attention to detail is remarkable showcasing a level of craftsmanship seldom seen in gaming The storyline is gripping filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat Each character has a distinct personality and their intertwining narratives provide a deep and engaging experience that is both humorous and emotionally charged The gameplay too is exceptional The controls are smooth and intuitive allowing for seamless transitions between driving shooting and participating in various activities From highspeed police chases to intense heists and exhilarating stunt jumps there is always something to do and a sense of freedom that is unparalleled GTA V boasts an expansive multiplayer mode that further amplifies the games longevity Whether its joining a crew and engaging in epic battles or simply exploring the vast open world with friends the multiplayer component provides endless hours of entertainment and camaraderie Furthermore the constant updates and DLCs released by Rockstar Games have kept the game fresh and exciting From new vehicles and weapons to challenging missions and events the developers commitment to the games ongoing support is commendable However its worth mentioning that the game does contain mature content and violence which may not be suitable for all audiences While it successfully explores darker themes its important for players to approach it with maturity and awareness All in all Grand Theft Auto V is an exceptional game that has undoubtedly become a cultural phenomenon With its stunning visuals captivating narrative and an expansive open world that begs to be explored it is a mustplay for any gaming enthusiast Despite the countless hours invested the game continues to surprise and captivate me making it a definite contender for the title of the greatest game of all time I cannot recommend GTA V enough Whether youre a fan of the series or new to the world of GTA this game is a true masterpiece that should not be missed Happy gaming Note The rating and review are based on personal experience and may differ from individual to individual

"Regarding GTA 5 ONLINE
The missions do not pay well enough because Cockstar wants us to buy shark cards
The whole game is just a platform to sell shark cards from
It seems they purposely make the missions unenjoyable to coax you into buying shark cards

"NB I havent been a fan of the series though I enjoyed RDR2 a lot so if you are or want to try it out maybe this review isnt for you Also as I understand the overwhelming majority of people now buy it for Online which I also dont care about this is about the singleplayer mode

So Ive played quite a few huge sandbox games Ive even 100 or close to 100 completed quite a few Why does GTA V not work for me in that regard

Well really the answer is quite simple despite being a huge open world with many many activities you bcouldb do I dont particularly care to actually do any of them It is honestly quite baffling as to how much work the game developers have put into things that just seem completely out of place and pointless You can do parachute jumps You can play tennis You can do plane stunts You can do a triathlon You can buy property You can participate in car races You can do yoga You can play golf You can buy and sell stock on the stock market You can use your inconvenient phone camera which makes you stand completely still while you use it to take pictures of wildlife that kills you in one hit

But is that really why Id play a Grand Theft Auto game

Sure there are still the main missions and a few side ones but completing ALL of them took me less than 40 hours and that included some messing around which is quite a feat for a large sandbox

But heres the thing I didnt bactuallyb complete all of the side missions Why Well because I have no way to know how to do that

One issue is that some side missions seem to be locked behind buying particular properties which is not only completely notobvious especially since not all of them do that but also requires you to either finish the game to get any money to spare or abuse the stock market system which due to its own quirks can be quite hard to do without a guide Others are random as in while they have specific points where they can trigger you wouldnt know what these points are without a guide and they might bnotb trigger there even if youre nearby purely by chance Yet others require even more obscure ways of starting them

Lastly there are several collectathon missions in the game but seriously screw them No markers no clues no nothing Apparently one of the protagonist trio can use his dog to search for bsomeb of the collectibles but the game never explained it or that its even possible so good luck figuring that without a guide And even then youd need to run around the huge map to do this

Its a good thing that I didnt even try to get 100 though because apparently one of the completion marks requires the use of a separate mobile app which has been at this point removed from stores Wompwomp

Gameplaywise GTA V feels smoother than GTA IV though thats not saying much The flight controls are as horrendous as ever going for completely misplaced realism The police are cheating bastards who know what your location is at any point in time can spawn out of thin air and have cars that rubberband to you no matter what making upgrading cars for speed pretty much pointless Your health regenerates only up to half and there are rarely any health pick ups and no armor pick ups forcing you to stay in cover most of the time in a shootout

The story is not very gripping either mostly concerning not particularly likable people doing things for extremely petty reasons The best part of the game are heist missions purely because of how you get to choose how they go even if in reality there arent that many ways your choices affect them bar the one major one on the selected approach method Unfortunately there are only a few of those throughout the entire game and I honestly dont know why else would I recommend it"
"Great game especially with friends The graphics are really good and the game is very well optimized as well even an entry level computer of today could run it well There are also lots of things to do in this game Stuff like messing around missions heists mini games story mode etc Like seriously theres an insane amount of stuff to do The game has so much play value 

What I like most in the game was the heists the challenging content of the game doomsday heist playing with friends collecting cars and weapons messing around and the environment 

The game is worth every penny I highly recommend it"

You updated the game Now I cant play it What did you do
If a game as greedy as this cant steal your money theyll steal your time and effort instead The storys very fun but for christs sake do not boot up the online mode no matter how cool the new update looks There are more fun things to do with the grinding youll need to even TRY it
Good game
I LIKE because it fun

its good
this is a grate game
"Very optimized port of the game Unfortunately cant play the game fully offline because of Rockstar Games Launcher DRM which is a downside

EDIT I can no longer recommend this version simply because of how predatory and broken the Rockstar Games Launcher is Everytime I use it the launcher always finds a way for me not to play GTA V and other Rockstar games Just recently Ive ran into an issue involving the activation of my CD key through the RSG This wont even let me play the game because they want to completely ignore Steams DRM and security for games in favor of their own proprietary security measures This ultimately harms the experience of the players in the name of money Therefor I cannot recommend this game at all"

"You cant play singleplayer without online functionality Nice job Rockstar Context My old Social Club account got hacked and Im trying to make a new one Supports being slow in unlinking it Make a glorious game and years later lock it behind an already shoddy account system EVEN WITH SINGLEPLAYER PLAY

Got my account linked to Steam back after days of hassle with support Really shouldnt lock singleplayer stuff behind online stuff anyway Thats scummy as hell"

FUNNNNN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVERRRR
Grand Theft Auto V stands as a gaming titan a masterpiece that defines the openworld genre With a rich narrative three compelling protagonists and an expansive meticulously crafted world it sets an unparalleled standard The games enduring popularity and groundbreaking design secure its place as one of the greatest games of all time In every aspect GTA V is a triumph of storytelling gameplay and technical achievement
Its just fun
Fine I guess Ill play it again Rockstar has me by the balls and they really know just how to squeeze em
Its the best one but it should look like more realistic to catch your eyes

"This is the first GTA Ive ever played and probably the only  one I ever will

Not because I didnt like it but because I absolutely fell in love with it and I genuinely dont think theres any topping this game I guess well see with GTA6 

This is obviously a labour of love and as someone who also loved both RDR games I was still blown away by the quality in this game The characters and actors are amazing and the story is that perfect blend between comedy drama and parody 

I have an issue with some of Rockstars janky mechanics in some places and some side quest are more infuriating than fun but thats not exclusive to this game its just  Rockstar thing xD

Very very very good game great quality and detail"

REALLY FUN GAME FOR KIDS UNDER 8 YRS OLD
The All time fav game
It always needed more story line content Ive never liked the online part of this game its just not for me and it is full of Aholes that just want to ruin your game and unless you have lots of user stats no one will join your missions but I love the story I must have restated it twenty or so times over the last ten years I am looking forward to America today Oh I mean GTA6 but I hope it stacks up to 5 and engages the world not just more Go America number one crap because guess what you aint even in the top ten
"Do not get this game they have the WORST customer support Example

Russian guy hacks account

Russian switches email on the account to Russian account

I notice this happened when I tried to log into GTA

Contact support

Support says We can help but we need to verify the email on the account first

Like wtf dude and oh I cant unlink my steam either because you want me to verify the email on the account Understandable except I DONT OWN THE FUCKING EMAIL ON THE ACCOUNT SOME RUSSIAN HACKER DOES YOU IDIOTS God damn Please PLEASE do not buy this game until they figure out their shitty ass service 

Also the cherry on top of this is even if I WANTED to buy more Rockstar games which I will not do anymore I cant because the email being linked to my steam prevents this specific steam account from playing on any other god damn account YIPPEE"

"I kept playing to see why so many people love the online side of this game and I eventually came to the realisation that it is just a bit shit and people must be complete morons to actually enjoy it

Like its GTA it was fun to go back to something Ive not played in nearly ten years its nice to revisit the map and having some new characters campaigns vehicles and things to do but thats it The game has not improved combat and character movement is still awful driving gets boring quickly and all the new jobs missions heists and vehicles feel tacked on nothing actually feels new or very interesting

The worst thing is the actual online side everyone is there just to prevent regular players attempting missions or trying to start missions I understand people messing about with new vehicles theyve bought but its just so lame that thats what some people do every night of their lives its almost as douche as buying hacks or even worse buying in game money from Rockstar My worst personal experience was a multiplayer mission where at the end everyone was spawned together so one players killed everyone else and stole everyones money Good Game design 

You can get away from all the other online players by selecting a new session and invite only but this only really helps if you want to play solo My main interest in the game was to play coop with a buddy its doable but its a total ball ache as you will spend almost half your time in loading screens you cant just play together as you constantly have to invite the other player to do something and if you finish a mission together then you are both put back into separate lobbies

I wish I hadnt bothered with the online the only thing that its taught me is that Rockstar seriously needs to pull some magic off for GTA6 to be good Im sure its going to look incredible and be an insanely detailed world just like RDR2 but they need to reassess their gameplay unless the only people they are catering for are twelve year old boys with ADHD"
"1 out of 10 gameplay experience  

So I decided to finally try a GTA game and this PoS wouldnt work 20 min in  It crapped out on a loading screen  It turns out that this has been a problem since 2015  Its almost 2024 now  Well definitely not getting the sequel on the consoles considering they cant fix an issue thats 9 years old  Ill keep trying to play through the game and if the problem manages to get resolved then Ill change my review"
Game is fun Also reminds me a lot of GTA San Andreas which I played for cooountless hours as a kid 3

"Because of Rockstars overrestrictive DRM I am unable to play a singleplayer game I paid money for 
To be able to play the game at all even offline play you need to sign into a Rockstar Social Club account 

Having first launched the game years ago I used a Rockstar account I no longer have access to No big deal I thought Id just make a new one and sign in 
Nope
You are not allowed to use a different Rockstar account than the one you first used with the Steam account I opened a support ticket with Rockstar and they told me tough cookies 

So I am unable to play a game I own despite having bought it on this very Steam account Never buy from Rockstar I suppose"

"Loading screen locks half the time you enter a building
Every single lobby has at least one god mode modder
They still add new missions and cars all the time without fixing previous issues
Heists are like trying to wrangle 3 disabled chimps almost every time
There are people who spam chat advertising their mods with no repurcussion They also use loud ass sound effects to get your attention or they spam text you in game which is almost as annoying
Each lobby has at least one child that asks for money drops almost the entire time
There are people who will specifically target a person and just kill them over and over to try and get a reaction Usually if you say nothing theyll leave you alone after the 5th one

TLDR sail the high seas for this one and just play singleplayer rockstar doesnt deserve your money until they prove they can design a multiplayer infrastructure that doesnt allow for RCE"

NARUTOOOOOO
Rockstar has turned into a bunch of Cheaters It feels like every possible thing that they can do to fck up your missions they do Your vehicles dissapear from where you leave them mid mission traffic plows into you in ways so obviously deliberate everyone knows it missions are laid out to force you to lose shipments and the only thing that they care about is hackers with money codes all other god mode griefers are allowed to roam unchallenged because they LIKE when they mess up your missions And now Rockstar has had 10 years to come up with new ways to cheat players for GTAVI I think I will sit the next one out I dont think they will be easing off on their jack booted methods to get players to spend money getting around overly excessive grinds
doesnt even load

I CAN GET BLOW FOR 100 DOLLAR BUY GAME NOW
its fun when playing with friend But it will be great when car crash effect is like GTA 4 and any good thing from GTA 4
youre a good kid Franklin
After playing this game I became a GTA hater The design of the stages is attractive but in general the driving mode and gunplay are awful and it is difficult to earn money and the artificial intelligence of the police is as if they will attach a tracker to you and find you wherever you are Compare game stores with Mafia 2 and many other things In my opinion this game is sht and if it wasnt for adding a cheat code to meet the needs the game will force us to either use the cheat code or spend thousands of hours collecting moneyAnd I wish I hadnt bought this game
its gtav cmon only thing is the mf modders lmaoo having funt times with them tho too
i mean its gta but i dont like how they fucked cayo
Si si si no si no quizas pero quizas si pero no se
If you need to be told why you should get GTA 5 you live under a rock or you dont like cool things
good game kinda dying
Stellar graphics and story mode
simplesmente um dos poucos jogos que não enjoa mesmo zerando  o história várias vezes
need to release gta 6 already but i havealways liked gts5

shits gas
game ajg paling keren
epic
Rockstar deletes my tickets to request help after my account was compromised It does not matter if you have a receipt on steam they will do nothing to help Really unsatisfied with the overall experience even though the game itself was fun to play I am one who believes once you buy a game you should have the right to play it but unfortunately they do not share that sentiment Do not buy unless you are willing to get scammed
Really enjoyed playing through story mode good game if youre bored and want to commit mass genocide
This game made me less violent
Story mode is great by default Online is practically unplayable unless your in a private lobby due to modders and shit as youve heard 83 times already I would recommend this game tbh bc with friends online can still be fun

The Devs for this game are ridiculous They make the online part of this game so grindy so if a mod comes and gives you a ridiculous amount of money or you use something to give yourself money so that you can actually make some money or use it to just have fun and buy vehicles they suspend your account To all the Devs get a life and let people have fun who arent harming other players Go suspend the accounts of people who are actual causing issues in online games like using GOD MODE or TP to people and killing them over and over or the people joining games and being invisible to kill you or having unlimited ammo and not needing to reload or explosive bullets I have gotten into so many lobbies on PC and Xbox and have been messed with more of those people then someone giving money or modding to give money Also how i know the Devs arent doing squat about greifers is because i found two the other day and they have been doing this for months now Anyways if you get the game to play online and have fun good luck they dont deal with toxic players and youll sit here and grind till GTA6 comes out and still have nothing unless you by over priced shark cards to be able to make a little bit of money
LOL
if this game had kids to kiddnap will be great

"Title A DecadeLong Journey through Los Santos GTA Vs Lasting Impact

Grand Theft Auto V a virtual playground that has been a cornerstone of my gaming existence since I first stepped into the sunsoaked streets of Los Santos at the age of 12 continues to be a defining and integral part of my gaming life As I reflect on an immersive 11year journey its clear that GTA V isnt merely a game its a dynamic and enduring chapter in the story of my digital adventures

Released in 2013 GTA Vs Los Santos immediately captivated me with its breathtaking scale and attention to detail The city was a living breathing entity teeming with diverse neighborhoods iconic landmarks and a vast open landscape that begged to be explored From the sunsets over Mount Chiliad to the vibrant lights of the Vinewood strip each corner of the map became a familiar yet endlessly captivating part of my virtual world

The narrative brilliance which has become a trademark of the Grand Theft Auto series found new heights in GTA V The trio of protagonists  Michael Franklin and Trevor  brought unique perspectives to a sprawling tale of crime camaraderie and the pursuit of the American Dream The heist missions a standout feature were not just adrenalinepumping escapades but also strategic challenges that required meticulous planning and execution

GTA Vs success didnt stop at its singleplayer narrative the introduction of Grand Theft Auto Online GTAO added an entirely new dimension to the experience For the past six years my friends and I have embarked on countless adventures in Los Santos from coordinated heists to wild races and impromptu freeroam shenanigans The everexpanding world of GTA Online with its regular updates and new content has kept the virtual landscape fresh and dynamic

The games attention to detail extends beyond the narrative and into its satirical take on modern society The radio stations television shows and ingame internet provided a sharp commentary on everything from politics to pop culture enhancing the games immersion and creating a world that felt eerily reflective of our own

The gameplay mechanics refined over the years offered a perfect blend of action exploration and a sandbox for creativity The characterswitching feature improved driving physics and an extensive range of activities ensured that Los Santos never felt stale even after countless hours of play

While GTA V garnered widespread acclaim it wasnt without its controversies and critiques particularly in relation to the microtransaction model in GTA Online Yet these issues did little to diminish the overall impact of a game that has been a constant companion throughout my adolescence and early adulthood

As I reminisce about the countless hours spent in Los Santos the friendships forged in chaotic online sessions and the enduring allure of the games open world its clear that GTA V is more than just a form of entertainment Its a nostalgic time capsule a digital diary chronicling my growth as a gamer and the evolving landscape of the gaming industry over the past 11 years

In the grand tapestry of my gaming life GTA V stands tall as a masterpiece that transcends the medium Its not just a game its a virtual home a canvas for endless adventures and a testament to the lasting impact that video games can have on the fabric of our lives"

Average Game not worth it
The year is 2023 Grand Theft Auto 5 has been released for over a decade I load into Gta online Theres and error and Im booted back to offline I try again Theres an error and Im booted I try a third time and thankfully it works I get into a lobby and cant become a CEO because the maximum limit has been reached so Im unable to start a business or do a cayo perico heist I go outside in my favorite car Im killed by a random flying by on an oppressor I call Mors mutual get my car back An orbital strike kills me I call Mors mutual a piloted missile from a sub kills me from a mile away I call mors mutual pissed off I am now looking to pvp I pull up to someone and try shooting them Theyre invincible They launch my car into the stratosphere with cheats I give up on freeplay I try to load the Cayo Perico finale I get stuck on the loading screen 4 times in a row and I end up unable to play the heist today These fucking morons developing the game are focused on adding 1 more dogshit car to the game instead of making it playable on pc I hope everyone whos ever touched the code of this game gets paralyzed from the neck down

"great and fantastic game hope 6 lives up to the expectations Single player is a lot of fun and enjoyable lots of twists and gun fights its worth it online however can be hit or miss lots of cheaters online but sometimes its playable so invest in the single player and play online with friends or on your own 

havent tried it yet but plan to mod the game and see how that goes"

"PC version still doesnt have the graphical update that consoles had for over a year now and with the recent update now doesnt have ANIMALS without mentioning thirdparty software modifications where console does
Dont waste your time or money PC version is an afterthought to Rockstar This is without me going into the new player experience to Grand Theft Auto Online where youre already severely handicapped by not having properties to launch most of the content that is currently out like Cayo Perico or base heists like Pacific Standard unless you find a group of friends who already have said resources or pay money to get ingame cash to buy said properties

SP is fun though I will say but also suffers from a lack of attention where Online has several more vehicles and weapons that the base game doesnt with no way to be able to use them without third party tools
Honestly just wait for GTAVI at this point God knows whenever that will be for PC"

"How to describe the heavy snowMy teacher said so  That was eight or nine years agoI was still in primary school at that timeThe first thing I do after school every day is to turn on the computer and watch the programBy chance I met GTA5He really gave me a great shock in my childhood and then I realized that the original game could do thisSince then I have been tirelessly watching related videos every day to see how the anchors are allpowerful in Los AngelesThen I reluctantly turned off the TV when my parents urged me to eatIt was a wonderful timeIt formed my whole childhood concept of gamesUntil this year I finally played this game and walked on the streets of Los Angeles Everything was familiar and vividI have traveled to this hometown through video countless timesI finished the offline story again no I dont know how many times I relived their story but this time I witnessed it myselfAfter many years it still gave me a shock about the stories of the protagonists about my second hometown Los AngelesDriving in the street car in Los Angeles playing Sleeping WalkMy childhood has drifted away but it wont forever the capital of Los Angeles a generation of classicsAfter many years I remember when the teacher asked me how to describe the heavy snow and now I have the answer

"Simply the best game in the entire series and holds up nearly a decade after its release I have no idea why I never got around to playing this sooner but Im glad I finally did Every main character is likable and hilarious in their own way even the dmn dog Chop had me at hello

Dont worry about how messy the online experience is This is not a game you should be playing for the PVP This very busy slice of San Andreas is more than detailed and vivid enough to keep you busy for a very long time Ive never met a GTA game that wasnt worth booting up just to go for a cruise and get absolutely nothing done and still feel like a satisfying time was had Five does this best  I daresay better than my previous favorite entry in the franchise Vice City There is plenty to keep you busy until 6 comes out in a few years  and no doubt that announcement is gonna drive a lot of people even a whole new generation of  gamers back here to 5 while they wait with baited breath At the prices it usually goes on sale for  1015  its still money well spent Theres no better way to get your fix until the next installment hits

Theres a lot of wasted time still in my future with this game I have foreseen it"

As a long time player of GTA Online i am very disappointed by the new update how features I would be excited for are being held from the PC version for seemingly no reason other than they arent the new consoles so they arent next gen Without cheaters GTA Onine is a very enjoyable update but being neglected by Rockstar for years now I cannot recommend it for any PC gamers out there and it makes me more worried about the future of the GTA series on PC

I personally like Gta but there are a few things that need to be wary of firstly gta6 is on the horizon so any new players if there are any should do some research before buying pc isnt the greatest choice if you have a ps5 or series x id recommend buying on there pc is riddled with modders like ps3 and xbox 360 there are a few good pc players honest pc players but pc has been left behind by rockstar so having to worry about modders will more of a annoyance if you enjoy pvp in free mode like i said i enjoy gta i hide in invite only sessions anyway gta will always have a special place in my heart and not all modders are bad but doing a race with 3 laps and 45 checkpoints someone completes it 110 seconds is honestly annoying theres no point in trying to compete with that but my opinion is my own gta is 55 for me 
classic
online is the best

shit i would never play this game dont recommend it at all hardly even played this trash
GTA FOR LIFE
This is by far my most played gta game having over 300 hrs I most payed for the game just to have a little fun once again and to write this review The story sure is not as good as the other gta games but just being so big and having so much to do stands out for the last 10 years because frankly is the last gta release for so long is worth to be played I hope the next gta installment will be more ambitious and bigger than this one offering more gtacontent for the fans
This game has the most boring story R ever produced
very good
vroom vroom pedestrian insides everywhere
what can i say its an absolute classic 100million people can not be wrong
One of the best game I have played for years Never get boring and I can highly recommend everyone to test it out
Peak story and amazing mechanics Would definitely recommend
Gets boring after a while dont waste your money

its lowkey good but it gets a bit boring says the one with 80 hours but ye solid game worth 30 pounds 
I dont like that other players who can hack your game and kill you wish it was more peaceful Although i found out theres a private server just wish to be around other players just without the drama  I enjoyed everything else would like more clothing shops tho
SSUREE
Great game

amazing game
ITS GTA
its very good relieves my stress
this is a big gaame
"Online is pretty terrible 
Ruined by modders because Rockstar cant seem to figure out how anticheat works 
Bugs glitches and long loading times on some occasions
Some content is fairly repetitive and not very enjoyable
Half the cars have been taken away and resold exclusively to console players after purchasing the game GTA is a scam
The game is poorly optimized and will run at low fps while GPU usage stays low 
Inflation on nearly everything which means you have to replay the same boring heist a hundred times to actually afford anything decent
Overall the game has become the parody in which it once used to make fun of which is quite sad when you think about it A shame as the game has alot of potential
If they fail so much and cant get the online in GTA 5 to work properly then I dont have much excitement for GTA 6 There are much better developed games out there that id rather spend my time playing Sorry Rockstar but Online is a mess The players deserve a refund
Absolute Garbage"

best of the best even after being a decade old
They sht up the online with their dlc powercreep but its actually a good game
greatest game ever
Honestly I love this game I have played it on many accounts in the past The reason I wouldnt recommend this game to other people is because GTA Online is overrun by people with virtual powers to freeze your game So lets say you see an easy kill inside a store or you want to run over a group of people fighting it really doesnt matter the scenario  you can bet one out of the many players who may or may not be there has a tool on his machine which can log your IP which honestly doesnt do anything  especially with a VPN and they can do things like freeze your character spawn hundreds of vehicles on top of you and even edit your stats and money ingame The bottom line is this people in GTA Online are emotionally challenged They get angry too easily and when you anger the wrong person they unleash glitches from the nether onto your GTA character faster than you can blink This will disrupt your gameplay and might even frustrate the shtaki out of you but if you show them they got to you then theyve won So I do not recommend this game for anyone who is an emotional basketcase Rockstar and Steam really ought to start making gamers take psychological tests before selling them games like this The entire GTA Online community is toxic when it comes to ingame mechanics and dealing with getting your character hurt I mean that is the point of the game but they take it so seriously that they react like youve just taken a leak in their cheerios
Probably the best game ever made
Ive played GTA my whole life Grew up with this series highly recommend

"Rockstar is punishing everyone who owns a PC by yet again not releasing GTA6 on PC at launch They use us as cash cows while console players always get everything they want Im tired of being a second class gamer

GTA5 is still a masterpiece but it shouldnt of took 2 years for this game to come to PC either"

"I wanted to hit recommend because both singleplayer and online have some great moments and I do think its worth playing maybe on sale though BUT and this is a BIG but there are just WAY too many cheaters with modmenus that grief you and are invincible Like I get that Online is SUPER grindy to get to the good stuff and I totally understand people using these cheat menus to give themselves ranks and or cash Who actually buys Shark Cards lol but there is absolutely no reason to take out a low rank level 10 doing a job when you are an invincible rank level 420 cheating with a mod menu Too many hacking griefers in this game that Rockstar doesnt ban So I just cant recommend currently

Its good When it isnt grindy and you arent being griefed by modmenu cheaters"
The only open world game where i get more than 100 fps
if you like driving around and murdering innocent people or your one of the 5 people who didnt play the story this game is for you otherwise online is just shit used to be fun now its more chaotic and headachey than gmod sand box everyone hacks constantly prompting you to play the little side missions and takes forever to make any money just do what everyone else does and hack a lil bit at this point in the game youll never be on anyone elses level and just spending 30 min doing the same shit over and over and over again sucks fun game still if you wanna waste countless hours but i think there are better options

yes
VI is comingg
tbh idk why i keep playing this its not bad but online leaves me feeling hollow when im not getting into admittedly thrilling car chases and fights with friends of course its a good game and the singleplayer story experience is amazing so pick it up if you havent already
if you know you know all time hands down one of the best video game in history in the GTA series
good game so far
Heists are fun with friends
This game has been around for almost a decade It gets a lot of love that is well deserved and its even better on PC then it was on console when I originally played it at launch I dont think I need to elaborate on the story or the game mechanics it is your typical GTA style open world sandbox affair and no one in the business does it better then Rockstar Games Itll be interesting to see if their next release is as interesting seeing as this style of game has started to feel stale at least thats how I felt about RDR2 I know that people loved that title however it was a little bit drawn out for my tastes I will be replaying that one too just to give it another shake a few years later I cant say that this is a bad game and tbh it is my second fav in the franchise behind Vice City

Cool game
"Today I want to introduce you to a highly anticipated game Grand Theft Auto V GTA V The game is an actionadventure game developed by Rockstar Games and first released in 2013

First lets talk about the graphics of the game Grand Theft Auto V uses advanced graphics technology to make the scenes and characters in the game very realistic Whether it is the architecture of the city the natural scenery or the facial expressions of the characters every detail is carefully designed to make people feel like they are in it At the same time the animation effects of the game are very smooth making people feel like watching a Hollywood blockbuster

Next lets talk about the plot of the game Grand Theft Auto V takes place in the fictional city of Los Angeles and allows players to take on the roles of three different characters Mike Trevor and Franklin Each of these three characters has its own story arc and players need to complete missions to advance the story The whole story is tight gripping and irresistible

Finally lets talk about how the game is played Grand Theft Auto V is an action adventure game in which players are required to drive shoot sneak and more At the same time there are a variety of tasks for the player to complete these tasks not only test the players operating skills but also make the game more interesting

Overall Grand Theft Auto V is a very good game Its beautiful picture compact plot diverse gameplay people can not extricate themselves If you love action adventure games then this game must not be missed"

"Whos joe a distant voice asks

Instantly everyone nearby hears the sound of 1000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his location

The earth itself seemed to cry out in agony until finally the ground itself split open and a horrific creature crawled from the ground covered in mucus and tar

Joe Momma the creature whispered

The man cried out in pain as he disintegrated into dust and the whole world fell silent in fear

I did a little trolling the wretched creature remarked before burrowing back into the earth"

"Pretty good but San Andreas is better What I struggle with is how the map was introduced fuckton of space right away Would have been better if it was slowly introduced I still have no idea where I am when Im cruising around  Or maybe its because the graphics are so good Maybe its just me

Im here only for the story mode so ofc Id wish there was more of it The characters are great I enjoy how different they all are"
nice and sexy

This type of games dont need any review
The game has great dialogues and awesome voice acting especially Micheals Will surely miss the game GTA 6 here we go
"I must admit that I had high hopes for Grand Theft Auto 5 but my experience left me incredibly disappointed While the game offers an openworld environment with plenty of opportunities for chaos and mayhem it falls far short in terms of diversity and inclusion and this issue significantly tarnished my overall enjoyment

The primary problem I encountered was with the games three main characters Michael Franklin and Trevor Its 2023 and the gaming industry should be moving towards better representation and inclusivity Unfortunately GTA 5 missed the mark entirely"

The cars in this game are really well made and nice to look at When in the online mode you can customise a character almost fully and also stealbuy a car to keep One problem I have is when in the online mode players with high wealth and good weapons grief on others
fire cant wait for the next instalment

"Rockstar account required just to play OFFLINE 

Unable to play the game because the Rockstar launcher wont send verification emails
Unable to play the game because the Rockstar launcher wont allow me to play when I make a new account because I made before in the past for RDR2 
Unable to complete password reset because the Rockstar launcher wont stop asking me to complete over 16 captcha puzzles that always fails at the end 

Literal dumpster fire"

"After a decade of this game being out and bringing so much joy and great memories to our GTA5 community 
As 1 out of millions that played this game till this day i will recommend this game to everyone and anyone because this game is not only just our childhood memories and moments but one of the worlds greatest games to ever hit The gaming community in history Every update was a blast and its sad to now have to let go of all our great times With GTA6 coming out were more excited then ever and just cant wait for all the great graphics and great new memories"

cuh
Unbelievable how a multi million company can be too limited to either properly program or remove their stupid forced launcher when they think they can make a Steam release You buy a title from rockstar on steam again so that you can escape this moronic senseless plague called rockstar social garbage and then after a 100GB download you get nothing but crazy error messages login prompts and when you have made it into the game you are asked for some activation to register the game you bought on steam with rockstar
"PEW PEW COpS SHOOT BIG CAR STEEAL

great with friends when u online but story mode is awesome right now im modding the game for single player having fun with thatslap face
"The game itself is a masterpiece however I am extremely annoyed by how Rockstar is treating their customers Since months Im not able to access my account Im not even playing online so Im not banned or anything Ive made multiple support requests and support simply doesnt respond I doubt I will ever buy a rockstar game again regardless of how great that game might be

Here are two thumbs up for you Rockstar

"Cons Rockstar LauncherSocial Club Account

FYE
"TLDR GTA Online does not feel like GTA and is Pay2Win

You can buy with real money weapons and supercharged weaponized vehicles This allows you to dominate all other players Regular players will never have those if they dont make this game their fulltime job for extended period of time

The super charged weapons and vehicles make this game have zero GTA vibe Im trying to blast someone with a shotgun but they perish me with some alien looking alien sounding weapon that I do not even know what it is Laser weapons What about learn how to make a consistent game experience

Also game experiences so many issues when trying to play with friends I will join a session but not be with them in a session or I would get kicked for no reason etc

I am not even gonna mention anything about cheatersmodders as it doesnt matter Whats the difference between a cheater oneshoot killing me and a kid who poured ton of money into the game and can chase me around a map in a flying motorbike thats capable of shooting rookets 

GTA No This game does not feel like a GTA"
It is very detailed and is very fun with so many fun and interesting things to do I love it and you will too
very good game but ofc the gta online loading is trash as always

"i dont have a problem with story mode but after u 100 story mode it would only make sense to play online
worst mistake of my life
gta v online is litearly filled with assets that have been copied from story mode to online maybe changed a little bit
not to mention the cheater problem in this game almost everyone is running with god mode and griefing the entire server
you would be lucky if a cheater didnt post your ip in the chat just because you said something like stop cheating
not only that rockstar doesnt give a fuck about cheaters ruining the game the only problem they have is when you cheat to get money because why buy sharkcards for real life cash when u can just cheat to get money for free
what im saying is rockstar doesnt give a fuck about players they only want money"
good game
This is my first time playing GTAV This game is enjoyable
I Love the Game because of the Shooting
Well it is a really entertaining high detail must play Game

Best game ever
For a 10 year old game it still manages to impress me Been playing it off and on since it first dropped on PS3 and even now on PC in the end of 2023 this is still an amazing game Even with GTA6 on the horizon at long last Id still recommend picking this game up if somehow youve managed not too and giving it a go Sure it has aged quite abit now there are prettier games out there for sure but the detail R put in this game is unreal and the expansive open world is still alot of fun to explore Online is playable solo if you really not interested in playing with randoms or dont have friends who play but is best experienced with others if possible
Fun

"Note to myself to stop playing Rockstar games

I was trying to finish RDR2 recently and I never felt so dumb during that time

Yes it is rather beautiful game with nice acting and ugly looking characters but the worst problem is like when there is a mission there can be shooting and massacre all around and no one cares but on the instant when mission ends dare to loot a remaining character because dreaded 15 second attention bubble code is instantly spawning a witness on a horse or riding a cart to report Your crime to the authorities

When You are hunting there will be no animals for hours but as soon as You are riding a horse they will be spawning because they are acting as a decoration

These kind of games are like the yarn string that we people use to entertain the cat  they put something stupid in our sight and we run to catch a that red string

But is this really what we want and need

Well may be some but I do not

I want to heave meaningful experiences in the open world game where I can feel as a creator myself instead of a dumb idiot chasing random number generator creating spawns to find and catch a three star animal for a crafting blueprint that will add 5 stats on my inventory capacity or something like that

Its dumb its nonsense

I cant put this review on RDR2 on steam since I bought it on Microsoft Store I believe so I put it here since according to my own memories  GTAV was pretty much the same kind of design

Much of the world is persistent only as long as it is within Your cone of view Like if You watch a traffic in the industrial complex You will see a lot of heavy trailers driving and they stay on road if You follow them further outside that industrial complex but the very next moment when You pan Your view to something else outside their spawn area they are lost  despawned

Think of it as if You were trying to play a chess but You are limited to see only the half of the chess board and every time You move Your sight the chess pieces reappear randomly to create an illusion of playing a chess game that is what it means to play these kind of games"
the only game i need this is perfect

very nice but the missions and npc are too OP its like forcing you to buy game shark cards just to get money

Its a great game and has aged very well considering how long its been up Good updates looking forward to GTA 6
Pineapples are Fun
I mean its GTA what more to say IDk
"I wont say anything new that wasnt said millions times before GTA V is a must own and play for almost anyone who enjoys perfect games You have like literally and open world in which you can do anything and everything is done so good so great I beat this game on PS4 and to be honest the control at the beginning felt awkward but its just like for 56 hours  then you will get use to them and it will be just awesome And there couple more minuses story mode  i didnt find any purpose for your crews skill levels  there arent many heists in the story itself or maybe i missed something And other thing is sometimes very frustrating controls of the characters when you there is action is some very closed space thankfully there werent many of those And the last thing is a targeting system when you are in a car flying on some 120 kmh  good luck in to shooting some specific targets

That said GTA 5 is almost perfect The story narrative screenplay acting voice acting directing and whole craftsmanship is the best there can be And i even just started to scratch the surface of GTA Online Overall  one of the very best ever"
One of the best game ever
Fantastic Game Ever i am excited for GTA 6
Mas malo que pegarle a un recien nacido
very cool
"Look at my game time This is just what I have on PC not including the last two generations of consoles dating back to launch This game was good at first but quickly fell into the MTX pit of doom where the entire game is based around leeching as much money as they can from you to fuel overpriced in game content that relies on an absurd amount of game time to achieve They spent literally zero effort whatsoever on combatting the modding issue and never will fix it that much is apparent You will never be able to enter a server with or without friends and actually get anything done without being griefed into another dimension by modders and hackers  Its a true shame because the core gameplay is good Unfortunately because of the pricing of items forced game time MTX and modders this game isnt worth your time Again look at my hours spent Ive been trying to play for the last 2 weeks to just run some basic missions for businesses and get absolutely nowhere When you get attacked by god mode modders and cant even rely on skill to overcome a challenge its just lame and boring 

Do better Rockstar If GTA6 is anywhere near as bad in these regards you will destroy your audiences faith in you"
spooky
They cant be bothered to release this on PC for GTA6 so no point in supporting this pathetic filth of a company anymore It has been 12 years and rockstar still isnt competent enough to announce PC Xbox and PS5 all on the same release day They are more than capable knock this shit off rockstar
No bowling

YEah DOG
Gotta wait 1015 years for each installment of the game  sucks  cant stop playing
it fun
good
when first buying the game its already a huge load on space then if you want to play with friends it forces you to do a very long first time prologue and an online tutorial that are genuinely grueling to do even when you play online theres loads of hackers who abuse tos and ruin gameplay overall good game but these issues are a waste of time and need to be fixed or im not returning this game
this game is fun asf
this game is littarly the best game bro
shit game dont buy wait for gta 6
U CAN LOT OF CRIME AND I APPROVE

Fun
great
do it online is crazy use a vpn
Playing it again on Steam Deck and PC now after originally playing through on XBox360 and various platforms sincewhat else can be said about this game Bring on the slow countdown to GTA VI
Really wanted to enjoy this but key binds in this game are fucked theres way to much of them and also weridly binded Red Dead Redemption 2 did it so much better Really upset because the story seemed cool but if a game fucks up its default key binds I just hate playing them Also fuck your dumbass launcher Hope they fix the keybind problems in 6 when it comes out
good game
GTA 6 is coming but you realize that it wont come until 2026 or 2027  
boom

"Warum GTA V auf dem PC das Nonplusultra ist  Eine Ode an die PCMeisterrennen

Liebe Konsolenfreunde

wir müssen mal ernsthaft reden Ja wir wissen dass Konsolen ihre Vorzüge haben  die Bequemlichkeit die in euren Wohnzimmern eingebaut ist der einfache PlugandPlayModus und natürlich das allumfassende Gefühl euren Controller fest in den Händen zu halten Aber wenn es um GTA V geht müssen wir uns ein paar Dinge von der Leber schreiben PCSpieler lehnt euch zurück und genießt warum eure Version einfach unschlagbar ist

1 FPSFlaute auf Konsolen
Auf Konsolen gibt es dieses merkwürdige Phänomen namens FramesperSecondFasten  oder kurz FPSF Eure Konsole ist manchmal so langsam dass selbst Schnecken darüber lachen würden Auf dem PC dagegen fliegt man förmlich durch Los Santos während Konsolenfreunde noch ihre Figuren in Zeitlupe steuern 60 FPS Pah Wir reden von 144 FPS und mehr  als würden wir in einem Zeitstrudel durch die Straßen rauschen

2 Grafikpracht der Extraklasse
Schaut euch mal die Grafik auf Konsolen an Es ist als würde man durch eine Brille aus Milch schauen Auf dem PC hingegen baden wir förmlich in einem Meer aus HighDefinitionDetails Die Sonnenuntergänge sind so atemberaubend dass sie Picasso zu Tränen gerührt hätten  vorausgesetzt er hätte GTA V gespielt

3 ModdingManie
Oh arme Konsolenfreunde könnt ihr Mods haben Auf dem PC haben wir eine Armada an Mods die das Spiel in alles Mögliche verwandeln Von Superhelden die Los Santos unsicher machen bis hin zu realistischen GrafikOverhauls  wir haben die Freiheit unser Spiel zu gestalten wie wir es wollen Eure Konsolen dürfen höchstens von einem Bug träumen der durch einen Zaubertrick behoben wird

4 MultitaskingMeister
Während Konsolenfreunde GTA V spielen müssen sie für jede Kleinigkeit das Spiel verlassen Auf dem PC hingegen können wir während einer Verfolgungsjagd noch schnell unsere EMails checken eine Pizza bestellen und das Weltfriedensproblem lösen  alles gleichzeitig

Also liebe Konsolenfreunde wir lieben euch aber wenn es um GTA V geht müsst ihr zugeben Der PC ist einfach das ultimative Spielparadies Gebt zu dass es ein kleines bisschen wahr ist  zumindest bis eure nächste Konsole herauskommt und wir alle von vorne anfangen"
Why did I move here I guess it was the steam servers

duh

LOVE IT
Id advise to stay away from Public GTA Online lobbies theyre full of modders that can kill you even in passive mode with stuff like earthquakes and steal your ingame currency invite only lobbies are the only way to have fun in GTA 5 Online freemode these days it seems I bought the game again after already having fond memories of it on the xbox and to get ready for GTA 6 so its sad moddersscripters are there to spoil the fun
its a good game Just run away from people with opressor Mk II in gta online
very cool game but cant eat the bear
Its GTA buy it
this game has everything guns blood  cars tanks heils
"

" Start up game
 Steal a car

Yep This game lives up to its name"
For a game that has been around for ten years the developers really took their time in making this game enjoyable along with many youtubers playing this it really became a part of my childhood a big recommended

"Highly dislike this game due to spending money on DLCs and I have yet to receive them after a month regret spending my money on this I bought this a while back and just downloaded the game today and didnt receive this product even though its in my library I got robbed of my money and I cannot even refund this product nor even contact the Support Team about it Very disappointed

Update
I finally got my rewards after a good amount of play time and waiting a month But still disappointed it wasnt awarded to me straight away as it caused me tons of drama that I did for nothing"

This is one of the best games if not the best game ever made Once you start playing it theres no going back Its addictive Its beautiful Its storyline Its graphics are just so perfect that it doesnt feel like this game is a decade old Cannot believe that GTA VI is so close now I mean potentially over an year still it feels close You should atleast complete the main story once because its one of the best experiences ever made in gaming Just a huge Rockstar Games worshipper and fan 
Bought this crap to experience the online version just to find out its the most buggiest unplayable overrated garbage Ive ever experienced in my life GTA online is literally run by a bunch of pubescent neanderthals who literally over saturate the game with modded accounts endlessly shooting at people that are trying to play the game like a normal person and it literally doesnt help when the game is filled with cash grabbing overpriced items 
GOAT
it does not accept my steam CDkey i hate rockstar social club launcher why u guys make another launcher for games steam isnt enough less than 20 games doesnt need new  launcher or add all RS games
its a good game for beginners
It is an really good game Not as good as OG games such as GTA Vice City and GTA San andreas 
i love the game because there is alot of cool glitched outfits
i love this game

"The Steams intrigation with Rockstar games is very bad  I have made a successful purchase 24 hrs ago and still not got the dlc perks but its showing me that the dlc is installed but in the home page when game is launched the game is again asking me to buy 
why

Steam asks you to get in support with the rockstar even its selling the game now its more than 24 hrs and Rockstar didnt even replied me yet about the ticket I generated




Edit  After several weeks of Keyboard war I personally asked to be called by Rockstar and after 30 mins of discussions and proofs I got my Criminal Enterprise starter pack I think that the integration system with steam and Rockstar is worse because the person on the other end of the call told me that They never got any money through steam  But he said steam initiated a bill for them but never paid them  thats the reason my criminal enterpise never got activated in the first place"
This game be looking better than real life

good game
Amazing
GTA V is one of the best games ever to be made in my personal opinion the story line is so intriguing and the characters are amazing if youve played this game alredy then here  are some suggestions on games with amazing graphics and an awesome storyline such as Uncharted 4 A lost Legacy Red Dead Redemption 2 and Mafia
This is a great game it is 10 years old has bugs but overall this game i grew up with and i really recommend it to others Me and all of my friends have had so many memories most definitely excited for gta 6 and most definitely worth the money
"to start off the first thing you will encounter playing this dogshit game is getting fucking molested by rank 900s on opressors thatll do anything to make your life a pain in the ass when you then decide to switch sessions you think that youre safe youre not the complete fucking opposite this time its comparable to switching from getting fucked in the ass by an elephant to a hairy fucking mammoth

attempting to escape this onslaught leads to the natural instinct to switch sessions hoping for a respite from the torment little do you know its like trading one form of brutal violation for another transitioning from the relentless pounding of an oppressor to the overwhelming assault of a hairy mammoth the switch is far from an escape its merely a shift from one level of agony to another hellbent on making your virtual existence a living hell

absofuckinglutely do not recommend you buy thisshit game and wait for gta 6 instead thanks"

"Disastrous Experience with Rockstars Customer Service

I wish I could base this review solely on the merits of Grand Theft Auto V a game that has captivated players worldwide with its immersive open world and engaging storyline Unfortunately my experience with Rockstar Games customer service and Rockstar Games social club has been so abysmal that it significantly overshadows any positive aspects of the game

Firstly attempting to contact Rockstars support is like navigating a maze designed to frustrate and exhaust customers In my case I encountered an issue due to the inability to log in to the Social Club using an outdated email address that is no longer in existence After submitting a support ticket I waited for days and received only preformatted administrative responses to which I promptly replied with diligence The support team then repeatedly requested the same information without taking into consideration the responses and content I provided to them Its incredibly disheartening to invest time and money into a game only to have any potential enjoyment stripped away by lack of support Even if by some miracle you manage to receive a response the quality of assistance is subpar at best 

Rockstar Games dismissive attitude toward its player base is unacceptable When users encounter issues they deserve timely and effective support not a runaround that leaves them feeling ignored and frustrated As a result I cannot recommend Grand Theft Auto V or any other Rockstar title until the company addresses and improves its abysmal customer service"

Cant wait for GTA VI "
e
For starters this game was launched in 2014 and still has the craze it had when it was launched Rockstar games is one of the best franchise for open world games thus because of the developers never disappoints with graphics and story mode Truth be told i dont think that the craze of GTA will ever diminish This is one of the best game for relaxation with a bit of creativity and huge load of missions Also the online mode makes it impossible to ever stop playing with the latest updates getting released frequently
i love this game very much its totally fun
good game
fun game for many years amazing campaign Unfortunately online is ruined by modders Only thing you can do nowadays is either play the campaign soloinvite only sessions or join a Fivem server Besides that trying to play GTAO nowadays is pointless without a menu Even then you run the risk of getting banned Save your timemoney and play something else until gta6 releases
"It very fun to go to the strip clubs

I KILLED A BOUNCER"
Why did you kill Johnny K 
this is very mind blowing game
smash
Till the time gta 6 arrives on pc this is the best game as far as i have played
Like all the other GTA V players Ive owned it on XB360 PS4 XBO XBSeries May as well own it on PC too So here I am Plus couldnt beat the price it was on sale for
Story mode is great idk about online tho
HIII
Grand Theft Auto V is very epic
Gta 5
its fun
keren
Everyone knows it is just Awesome
good game
"Even 9 years later this game is easily one of the best that you can buy

Whilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I dont like  and wouldnt really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage  I cant ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities  theres something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make them money whilst theyre at it

Single Player is also undeniably a brilliant experience Even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story theres really no excuse for not playing it through at least once

A lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since its original release but from an objective point of view even if this game released for the very first time this year it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away

The driving is much easier than GTA 4 literally anyone can be a decent driver in GTA 5 unless you have brain damage but I guess it makes it more accessible lol Shooting is also much improved and is high quality and those two elements combined with many others including but not limited to the excellent map make this game a perfect sandbox"
Even after all these years still a wonderful game
My coworker who I play GTA V with said if I post a review on GTA V and it gets 666 likes and 66 Awards that they will buy me GTA VI and 1 set of GTA V OST Vinyl So Im just gonna leave this here Help a homies

"Grand Theft Auto VI A Breathtaking Leap Forward But Not Without Its Flaws
Grand Theft Auto VI has finally arrived and its safe to say its been worth the wait Rockstar Games has once again delivered a sprawling immersive and often hilarious experience that pushes the boundaries of openworld gaming But is it perfect No but its still a mustplay for any fan of the franchise

The Good

Stunning visuals GTA VI boasts some of the best graphics ever seen in a video game The world is incredibly detailed from the bustling city streets to the lush countryside
Massive and diverse world The game world is absolutely massive and theres always something new to discover You can explore sprawling cities quaint towns and everything in between
Engaging story The story is wellwritten and full of twists and turns Its also incredibly funny with some of the best satire in the series
Improved gameplay The gameplay has been refined and improved making it more responsive and enjoyable than ever before The new driving mechanics are particularly impressive
Online experience GTA Online returns with a fresh coat of paint There are new activities to try new vehicles to drive and new properties to purchase

The Bad

Technical issues The game isnt without its bugs and glitches While not gamebreaking they can be frustrating at times
Long loading times Loading times can be quite long especially when transitioning between different areas of the map
Microtransactions GTA Online is once again filled with microtransactions which can be a turnoff for some players

The Verdict

Grand Theft Auto VI is a phenomenal game that sets a new standard for openworld gaming Its not without its flaws but the good far outweighs the bad If youre a fan of the series or even just openworld games in general then you owe it to yourself to check out GTA VI

Overall Score 910"
IT IS GOOD
Modders are making my experience much worse than it could be Constant bugged missions are no pleasure as it used to be even 2 years ago
deeeeeeeees nuuut HA
"To be fair the game has a really good story mode But unfortunately its online component has become heavily problematic due to the sheer volume of users with various mod menus that make it harder for you to enjoy the game
My recommendation is based on the fact that you can only truly enjoy one part of the game And that is the single player side"
ha ha ha
we all know this is the best game ever because of its open world and mods
"My first experience in GTA Online which was 30 minutes ago was getting spawn killed by a moddercheater blown up and then griefed by my own teammates So far so good

While this was my first experience im still continually playing this game and it has taken over my life for the past week and ive been grinding it for mostly every waking moment of my life as of currently"

i am just going to post this here GTA 6 wont live up to its hype and this game is going to be the last reminder of what GTA used to be also bring back Trevor Philips i know this is not GTA 6 review section but the reason i am not buying the hype og GTA 6 is the lack of crazy I NEED CRAZY AND I NEED HUMAN MEAT SOUP lol jk  I love GTA 5 for its social commentary i used to play GTA games for guns shooting and stuff but i wasnt interested in the stories until GTA 5 something about betrayals and craziness made the story attractive GTA 5 1010 experience i recommend this game simply for the story

"Bought and played this game a few years ago and loved playing the single player game Game play was so much fun and the story is awesome but

Rockstar now requires you to have and log into a social club account and you must be online the entire timeeven if you are only playing single player 

I have not played in over a year and when I try to play the single player game it will not let me Rockstar is not letting me log into my social club account and it seems there is some issue with the linking of my Steam account with Rockstar On Rockstars webpage I am able to log into my account but anything about linking does not apply to Steam and only mentions PS Xbox  which all had links for fixes  I would not buy any Rockstar games through Steam as you will not have any easy fix if there is any issue with the linking of your Steam account to Rockstar

I would not recommend this or any other Rockstar game and unfortunately I will not be purchasing any more games from them as long as they continue to have this requirement to play single player games"

Lucky me steam provides key even after almost a decade
BUT
This shitty compagnie is telling me that my key is already used DUUUUUH BY ME
So now after 10 years and more than 200h i cant play the game anymore
Support not helping or proposing voodoo stuff like deleting folders that doesnt fix anything

Its nice that its happening just few days after the release of GTA6 trailer It will reminds me to NEVER give them any more money
Ill find another way to play their game wink wink"
"there was a little guy named guy was an adventurous and curious guy who always had a million questions in his mind One day guy came across a wise old man guy sitting under a tree

Excitedly guy approached the old man guy and said guy Ive heard that you know the answer to every question in the world Is that true

The wise old man guy smiled and replied Indeed my young friend guy I possess the knowledge to answer any question you might have What would you like to know

guy eyes lit up with excitement as he thought of a challenging question Okay he said Tell me what is the meaning of life

The old man guy chuckled and said Ah thats a question that has puzzled humanity for ages The meaning of life is like a vast ocean with countless depths and each person must embark on their own journey to discover it

guy frowned feeling a bit disappointed with the answer But guy he persisted Can you give me a more specific answer Something more concrete

The old man guy nodded and replied Very well my young friend guy Let me tell you a story

Long ago there was a powerful guy who ruled over a vast guydom One day the guy summoned three of his bravest guys and gave them each a quest The first guy was sent on a mission to find the most precious gemstone in the world The second guy was tasked with finding the rarest flower that only bloomed once every hundred years And the third guy was commanded to find the secret to eternal happiness

So each guy embarked on their respective journeys determined to fulfill the guys wishes The first guy traveled far and wide searching through treacherous mountains vast deserts and deep oceans After years of relentless pursuit he finally found the most precious gemstone hidden within a mystical cave

The second guy ventured into enchanted forests climbing towering peaks and crossing dangerous swamps It took him decades but eventually he discovered the rarest flower blossoming in a secluded meadow

As for the third guy he wandered through bustling cities remote villages and explored the deepest corners of the human heart He spoke with wise sages studied ancient scriptures and tasted the flavors of life After a lifetime of exploration the knight realized that true happiness lies not in possessions or achievements but in the simple moments of joy love and connection shared with others

Years later the three guy returned to the guydom presenting their findings to the GUY The first GUY offered the most precious gemstone the second GUY presented the rarest flower and the third GUY shared his wisdom about the secret to eternal happiness

The GUY was pleased but he couldnt help but feel that something was missing He pondered for days until he finally realized that the true meaning of life lay not in seeking external treasures or ephemeral pleasures but in living a life of purpose compassion and making a positive impact on the world

So my dear GUY the old man GUY concluded The meaning of life is a personal journey filled with adventures discoveries and the pursuit of goodness It is about finding your own purpose embracing love and kindness and leaving a lasting legacy that resonates with future generations

GUY listened intently absorbing the old mans words A smile appeared on his face as he thanked the old man GUY for his wisdom With a newfound understanding he walked away ready to embark on his own journey to uncover the meaning of life

And so the story continues with GUY forging his own path seeking answers and making the most out of every precious moment of his existence

Remember my GUY the meaning of life may be elusive but its in the journey itself that we find purpose fulfillment and true happiness WHO"

"The game is full of degenerates making it impossible to play the heists as intended when one FK up dies you have to restart again ive been trying to complete the prison break heist for the last 45 hours of my game time
Its such a good game but you spend most of your time online waiting in lobbys and playing the same setup or heist finale over and over again because people either constantly die F up somehow or my fav so far play the whole mission perfectly and then leave at the very last second for no reason failing the mission instantly

"Even at 14 Im really regretting this purchase and most of that is because the absolute bullcrap you have to go through to play the game  The launcher is a mess the social club requirement is extremely irritating and the forced internet access would throw up captchas for me constantly and then after completing over a dozen puzzles it would then say I got one of them wrong and make me start over with even more puzzles

As for gameplay Im not at all a fan of that either  I am a very casual gamer but I liked previous GTA games from years ago which sadly are no longer on Steam so I figured Id give this one a shot thinking it would be similar but it feels completely different  Im not a fan of forced paths which story mode kind of locks you in to  There were certainly moments that I enjoyed playing it but it always seemed to end up pushing me into a segment that I just found myself zoning out and just losing interest Maybe Im weird but if Im playing a game I like to play a game and if Im watching TV I like to watch TV  I dont want to switch between the two constantly  One other frustration is that the game makes a very weak attempt at trying to get you used to specific buttons and actions and many times pops up dialog telling you stuff while youre trying to complete something else like racing down the road etc

Ill probably play around with it again in the future but honestly game play aside the launcher and social club stuff is absolutely something that makes me not want to recommend this had I realized that I was going to spend an hour downloading it and then over an hour trying to get things set up launcher configuration irritating login set up etc I would have never started down this path"
This game sucks Rockstar needs to hang themselves
Nikki went crazy
Loved the part where the girl is in prison and the other girl goes Do you know why youre here and the first girl goes bad luck I guess and then it cuts to a porn montage

Awesome game The graphics are amazing the amount of mods you can get and change are incredible The community in gta V is fun to interact with and its always fun hopping on not knowing what is going to happen My favorite mod for GTA V as of right now is LSPDFR cause I like doing police work Highly recommend if you are like me Definitely get especially at the price of just 15 dollars right now

The launcher is stupid and pointless Please remove it from all your games I prefer the PC platform but want a console experience on my Steam Deck You do not do this on PlayStation and Xbox why do you hate your PC players
good
love killing the opressor kids
Fun game overall but the fact that you cant keep your car while going around in story mode because if you take your car to a mission it might dissaper when you are done with the mission And you cant always get it back from the police station which sucks
i want to kys
L tbh
fun
I liked everything about this game
Not even an hour in saw a modder flying a ww2 Aryan symbol Lmfao

Its just GTA
Loading screen and hacked server simulator Rockstar is as in touch with its player base as a locked up pedo is with kids with about the same outlook just looking to fuck them
nice
sd
Car go vroom
gang gang ass game
"First of all it is undeniably a great game which makes it so much worse when you want to enjoy the outstanding Online Mode but just cant because youll get a stroke from being annoyed out of your mind from the Online mechanics 
Everything in the Online Mode is made to be as annoying and time wasting as possible 
Be it unskippable endless dialogue or your character being to stupid to walk in a straight line or just random events and dumb NPCs to make every mission as annoying and as time consuming as possible 
In combination with the outdated and super buggy movement mechanics you will die many times without it even being your fault 
And if you have the patience of a saint you will perhaps not rage quit after the sixtiest time you randomly explode with the slow ass delivery vehicle because an NPC wanted to sideswipe you for no  reason while going 250 on the highway
And sadly we all know why this is the case so you are more inclined to skip the unplayayble and annoying grind for money and just buy shark cards 
It could be an outstanding game but rockstar created a grindy buggy and often unplayable mess to squeeze some more Shark Card buys out of their player base
Ok the rant is over thank you for reading if you made it this far
And again for the Fanboys i love GTA V i love the online mode otherwise i wouldnt play it for hundreds of hours But when you have to grind this much in a game where a million dollars barely gets you a used broken down PoS Car the grind should at least be fun and not punishing you at every step just for playing"
gta 5 before gta 6 smh
good game no cap
YES I WOULD NOT RATE IT 18 YEARS
nice
"We all know what GTA is all about the gameplay is amazing
Apart from obviously some glitches here and there which can be improvised But yeah one cant expect such smooth gameplay when tons of users play it at the same time and also a few who use mods 
Overall a VERY good game to play and the story line rocks"
Just make sure not to drive anything that resembles a hellcat or some black guy will come steal it
Always have liked the game but now that i am returning to gaming it will not let me play since it wants me to connect to internet and make an account even to play ofline i paid for this on my ps3 ps4 and pc and now they will not let me play was a waste of money it never was neccesery before so i do not know since which update but hate it Just let me play the game i paid for rockstar  never paying for rockstar again
great game
Its a brilliant game that is made better just by the fact i can blow my friends up with a bomb truck Its even more amazing that the game can run fine on my low end pc on high settings with practically no preformance issues
it is a good game but online is kinda toxic and a lot of grifers and hackers but its a perfect game for people who are finding a good story mode
Good game i would recommend for nostalgia even if gta 6 is coming out in 2025

"With a total of 4000 hours played on the PS4PS5 version of Grand Theft Auto V I decided to buy it on PC

I think that the PC version is totally worth it Why I guess it was the weather"

This game is unforgettable
"This was the new San Andreas back then
Now we are approaching the new Vice City

In hindsight I think GTA V is a great game I cannot vouch for the GTA V Online because I never played it but the Singleplayer experience is great It is a very immersive and massive game with interesting character stories and lots of Californian clichès 

If Rockstar makes GTA VI as well as this one Im sure its going to be great 

Looking at sales they certainly have the money for it now"
GTA 6
gta 5 online is so fun to play i cant even describe itThere is lots of stuff to to and lots of money to be madedont miss out
amazing game
I have gender envy for my online character 3
A game of all time
this game servers are bad the game keep on crashing and it takes time to open everytime
"PC never got the next gen update 
Rockstar always treats PC as second class citizens"
GTA V
LOVE OF MY LIFE i can say because my mental health is now good and i feel fresh after playing gta
Its game isnt good

"when i am posting this there GTA 6 trailer is out 
I had always a dream to play gta 5 but i dont had a pc so i playes gta sa really long but 1 month ago i purchased a pc with my own hardwork money i am a kid 16 yo and i searched how to play gta v free but  you what i found nothing 
but then i thought that maybe i should buy the game so i just bought it from my parents dc
and want to you know one thing that this game is not a game its emotion for a player like me yeah you can say me child i dont mind but after a long period of waiting i enjoyed this masterpiece rockstar studios reaaly know how to make games
if you reading till now
stay happy have a good day "
I believe by now the whole world knows about GTA 5 So no need to recommend to friends or public
cant wait to leave los santos been stuck in there since 2013
There are cheaters in every lobby
good
W game
yall alreadyy knoo dis game fyee its literally real life with different physics
"GTA Online Sometimes full of modders toxic or friendly modders or little kids 
GTA Story mode fun to run mods with but turn them off in GTA Online unless you want a ban

GTA 5 Is a great game Fun while it lasted
Now i wait for GTA 6 to come out"
Its GTAV what else is there to say
It is fun
GTA 6 IS COMING GUYS AND IM COMMING TOO LESSSGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
This game is pretty awesome i would suggest playing the story before you play online The online mode is pretty shit Modders are everywhere and unless you have a really expensive imani tech vehicle youll probably be hearing beep beep beep and the kaboom a lot But the story is really fun the characters are built really well which is rather on track for Rockstar North
guns
op
Fun modders get pretty weird online though Story mode good
So much fun whether youre playing 5 minutes or 5 hours at a time

"was playing with my dad in the room and my friend said go into the shoe shop they just released Nike Jordans

"Great game but the gamekiller bug car moving in parking lot killing a character causing an unskippable quest to fail that is well known and still not fixed tried three different pc setups makes me give it a thumbs down Never finished it for that reason since downloading a save past that quest makes the game progress etc not seem like mine doing

Excited for GTA 66 though "
This is the best GTA game so far Highly recommend it is so fun with hours upon hours of play time
Its fun
Good game Nothing else to say

to many hackers including me
With GTA VI trailer released I am reviewing this masterpiece It is one of the best game out there Full of entertainment multiplayer fun and a great experience Looking forward to GTA 6 with hopes in eyes Thank you Rockstar for never disappointing us
one of the best game ever
Great game
Its GTA whats more to say
i can t sing in my acc
good
The online mode is rightfully criticized but not enough praise has been given to this games story and satire For an open world game of this scale to have a narrative that intertwines with three characters while each giving them enough room for personal stories is monumental achievement even if the gameplay and mission structure isnt doing anything revolutionary Its not a masterpiece like RDR2 but it is an excellent game
best video game of all time no competitionn
We deserve to play GTA VI on launch just as much as consoles do This is and always has been a shitty formula Rockstar
its a great fucking game buy it or suck ya mums fat titties
ROCKSTAR HATES PC PLAYERS AHHHHHH    1   1
its GTA its going be great
pretty fun with friends but when you play by yourself it kinda boring
GTA 6 TRAILER IS OUT BOYS
Please Help me My Gta 5 Login problem
it is little different on the pc I dont like that you cant play with people on Xbox and we are both Microsoft
jhmg
With friends GTA online provide plenty of mission Heists and random stuff to keep everyone entertained for countless hours hackers are annoying but not that bad anymore  at least for us
classic game
wow
is game
fire
jake hazen is a baddie 
very interesting specimen in the online world of gta 5
greatest gam e ever
very nice 
"1010

Yes"
I didnt enjoy the story or the game play
why the fuck in 2025 would you cut off 13 of possible device to play your new game for those who dont know Rockstar and take two have had the ingenious to only release GTA 6 on Xbox and PlayStation its a total kick in the balls to fans of the series who did want to spend 500 on a console considering we already have a pc that blows them out of the water and I know how this will play out we will wait until 2026 or 2027 to get GTA 6 and it will still cost 150 which is just stupid we waited over 10 years for this just release it all at the same time and save the hate
Fam its gta 5
y
Rockstar games launcher fixed by reinstalling windows
its fun

its cool
great
Extremely addictive and antisocial  Highest recommendation
its a good game
Very nice game  i like the story
best game ever
Do not buy You will spend more time trying to log in than actually playing the game why the hell do i need to log into an age old rockstar account to play single player on my steam game
Best Game Ever
If you buy this just for GTA Online then you are an idiot Have fun dealing with boring drip fed content greedy t2 and cheaters The only way to avoid cheaters in GTAO is to play on a console then you have to deal with children griefers However single player modding capabilities and multiplayer server mods like FiveM make it enjoyable and an experience like no other game 1010 endless mod possibilities
GTA 6 BABY WHOOOOO

GTA 6 IS COMING 
niger
just do it
the best game in the world
The cayo perico grindset
"Lets think about the appearance of a statue that excludes the aura of a real person believed to exist in the idea world and its internal implications are undermined The problem with this is whether it is due to the appearance of the statue or the reason for its implications

The problem that hitting humanlike polygons in the game is considered violent is caused by us roasting humanlike dough We roast dead meat Why do we think hitting humanlike polygons is bad as we are disgusted at how sympathetic they are to the picture of fried shrimp falling into oil

Are all of these psychological factors caused by objects that resemble the human quality Why should your separate body listen to your command and comply with it if you hit it Because its just a polygon and its not alive It certainly has a human form From what youre doing human dignity does not exist in objects that have a human form

Objects that do not have human dignity have bodies by human perception The realization of a psychologically acting material obscures the distinction between real and fictional Therefore an object that resembles the human quality is embodied as a substance in human perception plays the role of a falcon that operates in reality and causes a psychological change in the human viewing it"
I only play LSPDFR and 5M But allinall this is a miraculous game to play when trying to kill time
Loved the game have it on Xbox too Only issue was hackers on PC Rockstar really dropped the ball on keeping it clean Looking forward to 6
I did not kill him but I did kidnap his wife  Trevor

if they decide to release gta 6 on rockstar games launcher along with Epic only after the stupid 1 year wait of console exclusivity Im definitely not buying it and waiting for a crck
nice
changed review due to gta 6 being not announced for pc boycott rockstar
NICE G
Its literally grand theft auto my guy ofc positive review
я только игру прошел а тут уже трейлер гта6
its game is very good
Rate this down this until R decides to release upcoming titles on same date for all platforms
555
If you have lobbies to play just do it up
Same 2003 game play with even more racism and sexism  The combat is now super bad and the only thing R Star seems interested in is making a better looking game not a better performing game Online was rife with hacks unfriendly folks too
good
amazing game
the best stress relifer

"Honestly GTA 5 is a fun game that includes multiplayer and single player In multiplayer you can choose to play in online servers or with your friends On the other hand singleplayer is also fun for users who wanna play alone explore do missions
And so on singleplayer has many storylines and sadinteresting lores behind it backing up both singleplayer and GTA 5
GTA 5 would honestly be a good game if it wasnt for the horrendous amounts of cheaters inside of every single online server The game itself is a good game emersive and open world It sucks how its filled with cheaters and people wholl kill you instantly after joining servers I one time had to reinstall GTA 5 twice because one cheater crashed my game entirely Multimillion dollar company Come on now Im not saying there shouldnt be glitches or cheaters Theyre always will be Im just shocked by the fact that a multimillion dollar company has this much cheaters The game itself would get a 455 if it wasnt for how quick and easy youd get bored without friends or missions entirely I tried a quick time lapse to see how long it would take for me to get bored doing missions and one of me messing around Doing missions got a 4 hour mark while doing nothing has gotten a 30 minute mark I get the argument Im making above is stupid but it should be common sense for a user who has nothing to do and doesnt want to do missions waste time in something fun This game gets a 310 Many cheaters And can only play with people with the same console as yours which is pretty stupid but its fine As someone with no friends online is shit fivem is boring and the game is only fun with missions"
i lopve this game
Its an okay installment of GTA though nothing like San Andreas  But its GTA Online that is the real dumpster fire  Its an infuriating game to play and  nearly impossible to do without spending money which is obviously the point  Totally ruined Rockstars reputation in my opinion  A complete money grab the load times are terrible and impossible to enjoy  Absolute trash
Play this game to get hyped for GTA VI
Music Sounds Better With You is truly the best song you could ever find on the NonStopPopFM radio station

I am a 45 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father raising my son who is now 14 years old My son won this game from his uncle so we installed him on his computer and he started playing Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game This was horrible for me because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him I bought the game chose my skin and world and started playing but I was stuck in what you should do I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate I loved it because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died Since then this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well This game reminded me that there is fun in everything and I brought many happy memories to me and my son
rrrr
ok
GTA 6 trailer is released So I came to play again lol

This game allows cheaters to magically teleport you to their location so they can kill you So much fun SHIT game Shitty developers to allow this kind of thing DO NOT BUY at any price
poop sock
GTA 6 IS COMING BABY
good
no
Fantastic entry in a long running series Play the story play online with a few friends whatever Any time spent with GTAV is a good time Performance should be solid across a variety of hardware at this point Only negatives would be the online monetization which can dictate the quality of the experience GTAV is worth picking up on a sale if nothing else for the single player alone You should get quite a bit of time out of it
"this game just scamed the fuck out of me i had a good ass thing with 500 mill and that shit is just gone 



      i put a bomb in the head quarters"

I told myself i wouldnt write a review of GTA5 until GTA 6 release date was announced so here i am its ok Franklin was the only character i cared about Micheal was an old boring dad and Trevor was just lets just say i only played him when i had to to continue the main story line GTA4 was the best of all GTA games IMO
best game ever period
"GTA VI IS REAL BABY

Grand Theft Auto V is a triumph of game design storytelling and technical achievement It has set a new standard for openworld gaming providing an immersive and endlessly entertaining experience

"The single player is one of the best pieces of entertainment that I have ever had the pleasure to consume It is a big world with lots of fun missions to do main and side quests alike
Do not purchase this game if you plan on solely playing the online portion of it GTA Online is a terrible mess of bs The developer does not have the slightest idea of balancing online security and economy in an online game

TLDR Buy buy buy for story stay away from online"
very cool game i recommendalso relxing

Hello could I ask where I can buy the vehicles that you have removed  For example Roosevelt Porche from Bennys Shop or cars from GTA characters from Trevor and his Rebel Michael and his Audi and Franklin and his Buffalo 2  thanks 
Pretty good but took a while to get to work properly Not a console experience ofc
"Game is asking me for CD Key activation even though its already attached to my account
Cant play my game anymore simply because Rockstar decided so

"single player is good but the multiplayer is only good with friends and even then with all the hackers and trolls its impossible to get anything done

if you plan on playing online by yourself be prepared for hackers and rocket spamming tards blowing people up cus they dont have anything better in there life so they try to make yours just as shit

progression aint bad as long as you can actually get things done but again dealing with hackers and trills makes that almost impossible"

A 1010 to me online gets stale after grinding a bunch but the story is still top tier
No matter how many words I use to describe this game it wont be enough So let me just put it in one word for our convenience AWESOME it is
This game may be old but its one of my childhood favorites so i do suggest playing
i like milk
The dog is gay
good game
Best GTA to date Cant wait for the new GTA6 trailer to be released in a couple of days
The game is realistic and intresring but in online there are some hackers the rockstar must find an solution for the hackers
nice game
modders are nice to me because i ask them
"ive spent alot more time playing console than pc as i only have this version because of my pc friends despite the fact that this game has made me a vengful and hateful sonofabeach i still love this game to pieces my only gripe with this game is the no lifes that just want to see the world of others burn for some sort of amusement in their pathetic and sad lives  that is why the power of friendship is a thing lads

Its GTA V man what else I need to say
its tittie fun
fun
good cors do big drive
Incredible game
i like
Great game story line is almost perfect and fun Completed in about 66hr or less i did a lot of random stuff like online not just the missions back to back Honestly you could probably knock this game out in 2 or 3 weekends if you wanted to I dont have any extra stuff just the game the over all game play was great the bots werent to hard to kill Police were fairly balanced if you wanted to fight them you could but it was just as easy to hide But my main complaint would be the ending of the story mode i feel like they could have made it more harder to kill the leaders or at least made killing them each having a separate mission They Likely could have gotten an extra 20 minutes or so out of it I just feel like with the base game theirs some thing that should have been added It just feels like you were riled up for a bit finish with 3 big fights and it didnt happen But I would still play and dont regret buying
This is one of the BEST games to come out of alltime The story and online gameplay still hold up to this day though cheaters in most online servers I dont know what else to say I just like Grand Theft Auto
good
Modders and hackers have ruined this game Toxic gaming culture
GTA innit
"The ability to play any Rockstar games I purchased on Steam has been stripped away just as it has for many other people due to the ridiculous social club requirement attached

Below is the support ticket
httpssteamcommunitycomsharedfilesfiledetailsid3103521022

You have a single account for a launcher anything happens to it and Rockstar deems you not the owner despite obvious evidence thats it Your games are now rendered unusable The compromised account permanently tied to Steam with no option to unlink
The only option being to repurchase all Rockstar games once again somewhere else if you fancy playing them again remind me why Rockstar have any incentive to adjust social clubs current implementation

In GTA 4s instance it didnt even have social club when I purchased Rockstar added it in an update in 2020 The same update which also removed content from the game due to licence expiry In what way does the EULA or any other measure give the right to REMOVE no longer licenced content from copies purchased previous
Say you own a film on DVD  BluRay it has a wicked car chase scene Later down the line the movie company loses the licence from the car manufacturer of one of the cars in the scene Can the movie company then come and take away your film and hand you another copy with the car removed from the chase scene"
"An endless critique of the USA being and life
Michael Townley  was Henry Kissingers agent"

"dO I Really need to leave a review 
 Buy it and do some crimes
Oh can i call you criminal scum"
"The online mode really wants you to spend money
Also the movement mechanics kinda suck
Messing around in the open world is pretty fun but I find just cause 2s open world to be just a bit better
As for the campaign
I really liked it however it really feels like some of the missions are just trying to waste your time It has an amazing pay off but it feels really stretched out then again maybe i shouldve just been fast traveling with the taxi"

"Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece in the gaming world From its stunningly detailed openworld environment to its gripping story line this game sets a new standard for immersive gaming experiences The level of detail in Los Santos is mindblowing making it feel like a living breathing city ripe for exploration

The games narrative is incredibly engaging weaving together the lives of three distinct protagonists each with their own compelling story lines and personalities The seamless switching between characters adds depth and variety to game play keeping things fresh and exciting"

"After 2200 hours of playing GTA Online I can say this game is very timeless no matter how old this game is people will comeback and still play GTA Online One key reason is that this game doesnt require a highend gaming PC so literally everyone can still play GTA online without any performance issues

But always remember that modders are still and always been an issue in this game so I wouldnt recommend playing it on the public lobby it would be better to play in an inviteonly session or a friends session"
One of the best game
GTA 5 is one of the greatest game Rockstar has ever made everything about this game is just too amazing the dialogues mechanics weapons action missions story and obviously the supercars I Love it all 3

itz really fun and coolz D
i LOVE the GTA Franchise its been Top Three Favorite games  From the Birds eye View in the First to all the Liberty Storys Top three Favorite games GTA NFS and Burnout The only reason why GTA is contending with a threes way tie is due to the fact that there are too many Modders and CHEATERS on the online servers if there were no modders GTA would be 1 Still play GTA the most out of all my games

"15 years 2 AAA games and you still cant figure out your unstable server situation  Completing heists races or missions in Online mode are next to impossible
Making me second guess whether or not Ill even bother to buy GTA6

Stop focusing on your Shark Cards and your bloated content and fix your fking servers
Fix San Andreas while your at it"
ok
this game is the best

One of the best games of all time cant wait for gta 6 game is pretty money hungry though 45
good
I wish I could figure out whats wrong with the heads of all the people who supposedly love this game bunch of masochists probably  four different times on four different pcs the rockstar app just freezes when trying to load the game and i cannot get into the game  I have never had a full chance to actually enjoy the game because of this pointless app  Whoever the creator of this app is should be publicly hanged i own the game and cannot play it Its too late to get money back and Im sickened with it  I deal with the same thing with RDR2 as well  Im done with Rockstar Fuck em  I shouldnt need your app if I dont play online either  Im super thankful CDPR dropped the next GTA and they call it cyberpunk  because this has been a sickening show by rockstar
good
fun with friends
this game is crazy guys you  have to try it out

This is a great game for any average player You can be good or bad Though bad is so good You are encouraged to be an outlaw in this game Being a good person wont get you very far in this action packed game You gotta be willing to step on the little man to go places in Los Santos Take em for all they got
nice and good
double action revolver goated fr
Story mode is just unsatisfying you dont even get to make your own character for it and are forced to swap between multiple characters Online mode is pointless unless you want to just get killed repeatedly by people who cant enjoy themselves without ensuring other people arent enjoying themselves Overall the game is just disappointing

but if you are trying to get the game for the online mode Dont there are way to many modders and they will eventually just get you banned and you wont be able to have fun at all"

GTA V is a very good gameHowever GTA online has a lot of bugs in 2023  it crashes every time I play Perhaps such issues should be looked into

"I dont really know how to review this game the base game is still pretty solid but gta online is pretty crap

It seems like theyve removed the ability to just purchase the base game from steam so youve gotta get both the base game and criminal enterprise starter pack its the same price on their own store

The singleplayer story is fairly decent and the gameplay is fun enough though it feels a little empty in side content

While Ive had quite a lot of fun with online its only really because Ive only really played it with friends in private lobbies and as such Ive avoided most if the BS that the online community has to offer that does not excuse how horrendously grindy the online is and its only gotten worse over time

Also they force you to use their own launcher which is always bad itd be fine if it was an option or at least worked well but it really doesnt"
woow
awesome story
Ultimately the best experience you can get before Grand Theft Auto 6 arrives

what a bloody amazing game highly recommended great graphics amazing lore fun yet interesting gameplay and story absolutely brilliant My favourite part of the story is in the jewellery store heist when Micheal says you forget a thousand things every day how about you make sure this is one on them and rides off like a pro What an insane game rockstar thank you for making such great games cant wait to see GTA VI
"Game very fun 


Yea thats it"
I was able to play it 10 years after it was released and it was worth the wait
once again like they did in 2013 rockstar have screwed over the gta 5 pc fanbase from now on the next lot of gta online updates rae only going to the xbox and ps5 we are getting nothing first we are forced to wait a year now this like xbox and ps5 have better specs then us what rubbish the game is dead already
Online Mode give me PTSD

Grand theft is just a cash grab game The story is alright but any online interaction is ruined by 70 people hacking and rockstar has never moderated their servers so if you try to do anything legit you are either targeted by the hackers or pay to win people Unless you want to spend hundreds of hours of being griefed to get a single good car dont buy If you want to play online it is borderline impossible without running into people with infinite health teleporters or just god like abilities This is suppose to be a crime game and its just a place hackers can go without worrying about a ban or kick

This game taught me how to read
Got it on sale to play the story and man i dont remember the story being relatively short but i enjoyed it and if ur gonna play online definitely worth it

Main reason why I wanted a gaming PC still kept playing TF2 before and after getting one but still

GTA V came out while I was just a silly kid in 6th gradeI was scrolling youtube when I saw a gameplay for it and god it was perfect I was young but I had played all the GTA franchises up until GTA 4I wanted it so badly but I did not have a console or a PC that could run it10 years later I was able to afford a gaming pc and boy the first to do after booting my pc was to download GTA V the cheer happened the joy I was a kid again at 21 I watched 10s of games for the entire game but it felt like it was the first time I have ever played it Today I completed the game and smiled like a my silly 6th grade self did
violence is never the answer but it is the way

played on Xbox for years and decided to get on computer slightly sad about no cross progression but is a great game 910
"it was once a good game but wayy too milked online is practically unplayable if youre new either given money from a modded or just stuck on a constant grind 

Modding killed the game imo but its been dead forever just work on a new game"
Grand Theft Auto is a masterpiece of a series and number V is arguably the best one perhaps being the most fun you can have with your clothes on Or off maybe
GET IT
All micro transactions if they cared about the population they would let you transfer from console to PC But its a money grab just spend more  Story is fun if you havent played it but stay far away from online w the death by micro transactions pay to win

GTA V is the best selling game in the world and its no wonder it offers the content it does

I had a lot of fun playing GTA V both with my friends and by myself

Most of the time I played online so I cant evaluate the singleplayer from my own experience which I only have a peek at on the YouTube platform

The most interesting game for me


Online it would like more content something more entertaining

After a few hours there is nothing to do online

Few realworld aspects included"

Still so many modders you sometimes have to restart the game 4xs just to join a server and play then when you do find a server where a modder doesnt kick you from game theres modders killing you while in passive mode Rockstar really let this game go to st

options for online to play with friends is limited i always say rockstar should focus on GTA online more than story one i hope GTA 6 have more options to play with friends some like more hair models neon tattoos  couple options  events  more mystery that we discover with friends and  that Im sure rock star knows better all they just do is they give more attention to online instead of story mode
what have they done to online campaign is ok 710 ps Diamond  Cayo

as someone whos highly addicted to the online of this game please take these things into consideration before buying this is not an easy game other players are not going to help you for nothing It is essential you offer others help in hopes of making friends so that way you can help each other With that said some player will scam you and lie to you at the end of the day its every man for themselves Either learn how to survive or learn how suck  cause you aint getting any hand outs 0

Oh my stars and pixelated heavens GTA 5 is not just a game its a euphoric rollercoaster of digital delight that catapults you into a neonsoaked wonderland of crime and chaos From the adrenalinepumping heists that make your heart race faster than a turbocharged sports car to the sprawling cityscape that sparkles like a million digital diamonds GTA 5 is an absolute triumph of gaming brilliance The characters are more charismatic than a puppy in a bowtie the storyline is more gripping than a grandmas secret cookie recipe and the openworld exploration is as liberating as a unicorn on a trampoline Its a joyous explosion of pixels and possibilities that will leave you grinning like a Cheshire cat who just discovered the cheat codes to happiness In the world of video games GTA 5 isnt just a game its a virtual symphony of euphoria thatll have you dancing in your gaming chair with glee If joy had a joystick it would be GTA 5

"I have played 2 Grand Theft Auto Games GTA V and GTA IV and both Red Dead Redemption Games
I have to say this game is beautiful after 10 Years Mods are Fun on Story FiveM is very fun downside is that Rockstar Games has done nothing about Toxic Players and Hackers on the PC who ruin the fun if you can get past that the online is good without them If you are a person who plays GTA V on Console and you recently got a PC you should definitely get Grand Theft Auto 5 on PC Lets hope GTA VI tops this and GTA IV Id give the game a Solid 910"

Works wo any tweaks using Proton Experimental on Linux  The Rockstar launcher will ask for a CD Key which can be found on Steam within one of the the settings menus after purchase  Even at 10 years old still worth picking up especially on sale in the 1020 range
Story the game is actually fun playing Online its a joke the game is only fun online if your playing in private with friends Outside of playing in private almost every public game has a modder cheating harassing other online players When it comes to reporting them rockstar does nothing about this even though they say they do not support modding like that some modding is ok Other then that you have to keep rejoining games and pray you dont have a player in game harassing people For the money we pay for these games rockstar should be controlling this and provide alot better support then they are currently
the best version of gta series and best detail ever

"Grand Theft Auto Online has rampant hackingmodding issues which Rockstar has done little to address This includes among other things the ability for modders to tamper with and ban your online account crash the game outright obtain your IP address and even maliciously modify files and execute code on your PC the latter making the game malware See the National Vulnerability Database report httpsnvdnistgovvulndetailCVE202324059 which rates it 73 high severity and states Grand Theft Auto V for PC allows attackers to achieve partial remote code execution or modify files on a PC as exploited in the wild in January 2023 

Rockstars cyber security practices are laughable They are aware of the exploits but simply do not care Be aware that you are essentially downloading malware by purchasing this game and playing online This game should be taken down until these issues are fully addressed Feel free to copy the above if you choose to report the game on Steam as I have"

its okay
the gta V is soooo gooooood i reccomend ittttt
Story mode is pretty good but dont buy if youre planning to play online Its completely full of hackers that will ruin your experience
Every single online match is just full of hackers Theres 0 point to online play in public Given this games age one would expect a better suite of moderation and reporting tools but that definitely is lacking as the rampant cheating never ceases
Shark Cards go Give me your fucking money
ive played for 1065 hours and i play it almost everyday and i really recommend this game but in online there are a lot of griefers that are higher level then me my level is 8687 but the story mode is amazing Trevor is pure insanity Michael is that one crazy dad and Franklin is just a chill dude so i really love this game and dax in online is more like Trevor then anything PURE INSANITY i really enjoy this game and you will too maybe

I heard a lot about this game and it truly is a masterpiece the game is awesome and the community even so i preferrably play online as its a lot of fun in my opinion the campaign is also very enjoyable even tho i only played an hour of it i advise you buy a premium bundle as it includes so much for that price if i were you i would buy it when its on sale gta gets discounted a lot so you dont have to wait a lot i hope you enjoy the game as much as i do

"i bought this game for benchmarking on old laptop refund it because the laptop isnt powerful enough and grab the one on epic since i have a pc now this is irrelevant

and honestly the game still holds up even after 10 years visually and gameplaywise performed better as well than most games
810 just dont bother with the online mode"
dont recomend because it is very short game and i litrally complited this game in 23hours and now i am bored
Fun game

"Played this game through various platforms Started with ps3 moved to ps4 and then eventually wound up here on PC Initially when I played this game way back when it was still frustrating as all hell but at some level playable Online was very lacking and tedious but it kept adding content every now and then The apartments with ten car garages were the last thing I saw before taking a decade long break from this game I eventually got it again while it was on sale and came bundled with a ten mil package for online Cool I thought maybe this would help me catch up to what I missed after all these years  And today Im officially rage quitting this nightmare hell hole of a game I dont even want to touch single player at this point with how bad online has gotten It may have lacked content back in the day but now it is just an unbalanced nightmare of a mess Ive never seen the game cheat its way to victory the way I see constantly now Its like it has a mind of its own and just knows how to irritate the ever living hell out of you When you combine that factor with the onslaught of modders its just unplayable Whats the point of online if you constantly have to go into a private session How am I supposed to find friends to play with when everyone is running from the main lobby My first play was fine it even seemed better than what I saw on console but it only took two to three days to see this nonstop pattern The game itself is alright if you consider the single player aspect of it and how old it is By all means get it for that and do whatever But online Online just sucks I dont know when they decided to do it but the developers have made this game so freaking hard at this point that its just not enjoyable Maybe the vets of the game have no idea because theyve adjusted to it but if you havent played in a long time it is just not a friendly game at all and doesnt get any better with time I cant tell you how many times Ive been instantly killed with full armor and health or had a helicopter spawn into mine just to kill me but its been enough Im done Im just done with this nonsense Headshots hardly ever count anymore and Ive literally seen NPCs actually die and then just stand back up and proceed to murder me No matter how far away I am and at what ever angle they always hit me Maybe one shot misses maybe Meanwhile I see my shots go straight through them over and over again The list goes on with this game We all know what this game does to piss us all off but now its just ten times worse than it ever was Not to mention the fact that I had a modder randomly appear next to me and suddenly my character level went from ten to 100 just like that Online was never all that great to begin with but now it is just horrible Im tired of getting pissed off whenever I play this game so Im done Most of you are probably much more level headed than I am so youll probably be fine But if you easily get frustrated like I do then you may find yourself in the same boat as I am Single player is same as it always was but online is just a joke now

PS Dear rockstar when in the hell are you ever going to make these controls actually good Maybe spend a little more time in that department Im not the only one blowing a gasket every time I try to go through a doorway or something similar More than five games now and my character still feels like a crazed monkey with cement shoes that gains too little or too much momentum Also watching my character stand in place every time they open a safe in the nightclub was enough for me to blow a fuse too EVERY TIME Every damn one of your games has something like this and in more than one spot Good God its a game Lets get on with it Im dying of old age while my character is waiting for a repetitive task to get started"
This game is fun i enjoy it a lot Just a ton of Hackers which i dont enjoy End of discussion Perchance
Its gta 5

when rockstar will release gta 6 its been already 3 years bruh
"I have witness this buggy game becoming more and more buggy I thought I will get used to it eventually like a boiling frog but I was wrong I eventually can not bear it anymore today right on the Thanksgiving day The disgusting bugs in this game finally devours all of my thanks to all the time with this game 
So I will not give any thanks nor likes to this goddaamn buggy game which incite players attacking each other If GTA VI is also buggy like this I will definitely spread pirated for revenge on the clumsy game developers"
yes released since 10 years ago  still unbeatable in graphics
"Grand Theft Auto V upon its initial release set an unprecedented standard for openworld gaming that left an indelible mark on the industry Rockstars masterpiece with its sprawling world complex characters and engaging narrative was the pinnacle of gaming innovation at the time

The vast and meticulously crafted city of Los Santos coupled with the seamless transition between the three diverse protagonists showcased a level of detail and immersion that was revolutionary The heist missions in particular demonstrated Rockstars ability to blend narrative and gameplay setting a new bar for what could be achieved in the realm of interactive storytelling

Graphically GTA 5 was a marvel pushing the boundaries of what was thought possible on the thencurrent generation of gaming consoles The attention to detail from the bustling city streets to the sunsoaked landscapes was unparalleled and contributed to the games lasting visual appeal

However as the years have passed GTA 5s continued dominance in the gaming landscape feels both a testament to its enduring popularity and a doubleedged sword While the games initial release undoubtedly deserves its status as a classic the decision to keep it in circulation across multiple console generations begins to show signs of fatigue

The games mechanics while solid have started to show their age compared to more recent releases The multiplayer component GTA Online while immensely successful and enjoyable for many has also faced issues with rampant ingame inflation and a reliance on microtransactions that can hinder the experience for those who prefer a more traditional progression system

Despite its flaws GTA 5 still manages to captivate new audiences and entertain loyal fans Rockstars commitment to supporting the game with updates and new content is commendable However one cant help but wonder if the time has come for the gaming industry to look beyond the enduring shadow of GTA 5 and embrace the next wave of groundbreaking titles that push the boundaries even further

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V remains a landmark title that undeniably shaped the gaming landscape upon its release While its continued presence is a testament to its enduring appeal theres a sense that the gaming community as well as Rockstar themselves might benefit from turning their focus toward new horizons and fresh innovations rather than relying on the laurels of a classic thats been in circulation for perhaps a bit too long"

"Grand Theft Auto V Where I Learn Crime Pays But My Driving Skills Sure Dont
Howdy carjackers and aspiring criminals I recently dove into the wild crimeinfested world of Grand Theft Auto V and let me tell you my reallife lawabiding self is questioning some life choices right about now

First things first the driving in this game is so realistic that Im considering sending Rockstar my real drivers license for a proper critique Forget about following traffic rules I drive through red lights and run over pedestrians like its a requirement for the ingame DMV My character mustve learned to drive from a blindfolded squirrel with a lead foot

Lets talk about the characters Michael Trevor and Franklin  the Three Musketeers of crime Michaels midlife crisis is so relatable Im considering taking up yoga and yelling at my therapist too Trevor on the other hand is so batcrap crazy that the Joker would be like Dude tone it down And Franklin Hes just trying to make a name for himself in the criminal underworld while also avoiding traffic accidents caused by his idiotic boss thats me

The city of Los Santos is a masterpiece  its like SimCity but with more explosions and fewer city council meetings The attention to detail is insane You can buy clothes get haircuts and even play golf Who knew that planning heists and improving my virtual golf swing would become my favorite pastimes

The radio stations are gold I find myself driving aimlessly just to catch the witty banter and questionable music choices I never knew I needed a fictional talk show about aliens and government conspiracies in my life but here we are

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is the perfect game for anyone whos ever dreamed of being a criminal mastermind with terrible driving skills Its a wild ride and my therapist says I should stop referring to it as my crime therapy But hey at least my virtual criminal empire is thriving even if my realworld parallel parking skills are not Time to steal more cars and maybe invest in some driving lessons"

""
good
its ok kinda boring but idk
id like to start off by saying that this is a pretty good game a solid 810 with a great story featuring 3 protagonists and an online mode that has given me many memories however 10 years later with over 5000 hours put into GTA V between different platforms and having done everything the game has to offer i think im about done with this one now on to wait for the release of GTA VI
GTA V has one of the best storys of all time on top of that this game plays and runs great on PC online is fun at least imo but i do happen to like to grind games Now you may be wondering why am I not recommending this game Well simply put DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ON PC This games support on PC is horrible on top of that rockstar removed cars so people would pay for a subscription too access them a long side that they removed an update 2 years ago that completely changes the game for driving and removing cool cars  btw this update is in the files this update was  promised by devs early this year that they are working on an update for PC players to play the E  E DLC to be honest just go by game pass ultimate and cloud play the game there if you dont have a next gen console btw if you make any progress on here it cant be transferred over to console
very good game
gay
1010 trevor is rlly hot
If Rockstar would develop a system that would block illegal mods this game would be so much better on line I hope GTA6 would have something in place that would make this happen

Fun ass game
The amount of modders and cheaters have gotten so bad over the past few weeks that it has made this game a waste of time there isnt a single session that isnt messed up from so called modders its one thing to just cheat on your own character or game scummy but whatever but when your mess the game up for everyone else in the session you are not cool your just a douche bag I dont recommend the game not because of the turds cheating but because Rockstar does nothing about it and has allowed the sessions to become corrupt to the point that none of them work do to overmodding and not being cleared outside of a private session which suck nothing works right anymore An extra 96 hr revision the online sessions are now so buggy do to the amount of modder cheaters online changing the environment that none of the public sessions work right anymore they are all ruined and Rockstar still has done nothing its pointless to play anymore private sessions still work flawlessly but who wants to play online alone six thumbs down

Great game I really enjoy the Story Mode and how well made it is Starting the story mode really immerses you in the experience and I simply love it However I believe the online mode could use some improvements The loading can be quite lengthy sometimes up to 10 minutes which is insane in my opinion Despite this the game is really enjoyable

I love the driving and the graphics It can be glitchy sometimes but others than that its great

good but no
i love getting crashed by hackers every time i try to play online strippers add bonus point 1
I play this mostly for online and I really really recommend you just play this on console if you only want the online Game is full of hackers and consistently without fail they will lock onto you and just grief you because they can I have a whole compilation recorded of hackers just teleporting to me and destroying my cargo If it wasnt a hacker I can at least fight back and it makes the sell really intense and fun but when its a hacker I just drop my controller and say bye to 2M worth of cargo because there is no fighting back I had another cargo griefer teleport me in the middle of the ocean I had one today just rush to me on an MK2 Oppressor and I didnt know he was a hacker He blew up my cargo and he used missions on the map to teleport and I been trying to flag him down on a savage helicopter Finally after catching up with him 15 minutes later I realized he was a hacker because he was tanking the savage helicopter gun and just casually swatted me out of the sky then he followed me into 7 lobbies constantly spawn killing me Even the day after he followed me continuing to not let me play the game I recorded the whole thing emailed Rockstar and they do nothing about this I try ignoring them and do just pay phone hits and boom I blow up mid mission then they teleport to me and it begins all over again IDK what makes hackers target me but its gotten to the point where I typed to one of them to just leave me alone I am doing nothing to you His response was to put my street address on the chat and I actually got the police on my door the same day about a hostage situation The police thankfully knocked first and deescalated but had I been unlucky this could of easily been an attempted murder This is why I am writing this review Letting the hacker issue get to the point where police show up at my door because a hacker just felt like it I had seen rampant hacker issues in a lot of games but this one is just out of hand I cannot play the game and now opening up the game and doing nothing but playing it as intended can have the police called on me Rockstar fix this game or strip the live service away you are actively updating the game how hard is it to just add an anticheat I intended to 100 the games achievments before GTA 6 gets announced but I give up this is not fun it is the most stress a single game has ever put me through I could play on invite only server but that defeats the whole purpose of even playing it in the first place I want to relive those moments where I get chased by a griefer and that satisfying sigh of relief when you successfully deliver the cargo owning this griefer because money isnt my concern I am looking for a specific experience Not start up a sell and oh man I give up because a hacker just teleported to me and maybe if hes feeling extra generous wont leak my actual address on top of it

"A Tale of Two Worlds  Story Shines Online Stumbles

Rating  35

Grand Theft Auto V is a game of contrasts offering players a captivating story mode while also immersing them in the chaotic playground of GTA Online Lets break it down

Story Mode 55
GTA Vs story mode isnt just a narrative its a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together the lives of Michael Trevor and Franklin The character development is stellar with each protagonist offering a unique perspective on the criminal underbelly of Los Santos The writing is sharp filled with humor satire and moments of genuine emotion The missions are not just tasks theyre elaborate heists that require meticulous planning adding a strategic layer to the gameplay The attention to detail in the openworld environment is astonishing creating a living breathing city that reacts to your actions From adrenalinepumping chase sequences to quiet moments of introspection GTA Vs story mode is a testament to Rockstars storytelling prowess and their ability to craft an immersive multifaceted narrative

Online Mode 25
The transition to GTA Online however is a mixed bag On the positive side the vast open world of Los Santos becomes an everevolving sandbox with countless activities and missions to undertake The customization options for characters and vehicles add a layer of personalization However the experience is marred by a significant issue  cheaters

Cheater Infestation 15
GTA Onlines biggest downfall is the rampant presence of cheaters Whether its invincibility spawning unlimited resources or outright disrupting the experience for others cheaters can turn what should be a thrilling session into a frustrating ordeal Rockstars efforts to combat this issue have been inconsistent at best leaving many players feeling helpless against the tide of unfair advantages

Conclusion 355
Grand Theft Auto V is a tale of two worlds The story mode is a masterpiece offering a cinematic and immersive experience that stands the test of time On the other hand the online component falls victim to the prevalence of cheaters detracting from what could be an equally compelling multiplayer experience If you can look past the online frustrations GTA V remains a mustplay for its exceptional singleplayer narrative"

this game is just some fun that it
good plus i just bought it on pc and i finished the game on console next gen which is very better i bought this game because of fivem and etc
love this
hated every second of it
"Grant Theft Auto is a great game a very well designed very well written very well balanced game that mark the high point of current gen games in almost every aspect It pains me to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because one obvious problem which I absolutely can not and will not overlook no matter how great the game is And that problem is the misogyny through out the game

If you want to read about how great the game is you can read any critic reviews from Polygon gamespot or any other game sites And I agree with all them its a great game But I want to talk about women in GTA V or more precisely the lack of such

Character development in GTA V is quite interesting Every single one of characters you end up playing meeting working for fighting with or against eventually killingare total  Theyre selfish obnoxious arrogant stupid and completely insane They rob banks and kill people without the slightest remorse they use other people and set them up to killed while pretend to be peaceful and spiritual Theyre the everyday morons you see exaggerated 100 times People would argue that because everyone in Los Santos is horrible in their own way it is acceptable to have annoying and despicable women character as well

Heres the difference though The main characters Michael Trevor and Franklin as well as some of major supporting characters such as Leslie Dave or Lamar Theyre horrible people indeed but they all have some kind of redeeming quality especially the 3 main characters Theyre very well crafted extremely flawed characters with a lot of depth people you despise yet cant help to sympathize Theyre people you can relate to from a certain level Not from being a psychopath I hope but realizing that theyre facing the same problem we face everyday

But the girls in Los Santos are annoying shallow pathetic with no redeeming quality Theyre there to be funny or to create obstacles for the main character to overcome Most of them have very thin back stories arent all that interesting and overall theyre just very badly written Its almost as if the writers are so taken away by the dynamics between the 3 main character The bromance between Trevor and Michael the fatherson relationship between Michael and Franklin they just dont care about add women into the game

I have a half joking theory that Rockstar writers are probably closet women hating gay guys Theyre willing to write a main character whos gay yet unwilling to write a good female character Its not that they cant Bonnie in Red Dead Redemption is actually well written so is Katie in GTA IV Theyre real women with real personality and strong in their own way I was quite hopeful to see some real changes in GTA V especially after all those outcry for better female characters in games over the past few years Oh how was I bitterly disappointed It would be so nice to have a strong homicidal or not girl in GTA universe

Eventually I think the writers just dont care Why should they The game is making insane amount of money even as misogyny as it is Theres no incentive for them to write good female character other than it would be nice to write good female characters as decent writers

I guess I should talk a little bit about the actual game other than whine about misogyny Like I said GTA V is great But what impressed me the most is how well balanced the game is The world is huge but never overwhelming the missions are diverse and fun but never chaotic the character switching is fun and exciting but never hectic even in the middle of the heated gun battle All of the heists are very well designed and very fun to play out I wish therere more

Michael is probably my most favorite characters in all Rockstar games Hes such a complex character and so different from your typical game protagonist His psychotic and almost romantic attachment with Trevor his mentorfatherly attitude towards Franklin while still remain a hard cold selfish killer

Regardless how I think about their misogyny GTA V is a great game You should play it"
made me feel like a cutie patootie
its fun as far as story and SOME online play basically if you can play alone do but if not would not recommend but its riddled with modders and cheaters If GTA6 is anything like this im not buying FIX IT
fun
Just GTA
good
really nice game for something made in 2013 highly recommend it
I really like this game and it is my personal favorite i definitely recomend this game becaus it has every feeling franklin is calm trevor is insane and michel is profesional it also has great special abilitys that match each personality great game

Trash modders ruined this game if you are ok with loser modders fkin with you sometimes this is a dope game

Best game of all time but dont buy the steam version buy the rockstar games launcher version instead The steam version requires you to always be connected to the internet even for story mode The rockstar games launcher version you can play the game offline

The best GTA to date
"The game is a mixed bag It has some beautiful environments and you can have a lot of fun with it It does have some major downsides which prevent me from recommending it

Game breaking bugs and other issues dont get fixed 
 Whenever you load into GTA online you get the same spam calls before you get together enough money to make them stop by doing what they ask These are things that require 3 million 6 million It takes weeks if not months for a new player to get this amount of money
 Online takes 6 minutes to load on an SSD
 Floating uncontrollable van on the Motorcycle Club resupply mission
 Ammo disappearing in online which requires you to rebuy which is incredibly expensive
 Rapid fire bug that makes NPCs instakill a player out of nowhere Been in the game since launch"
Yes
everything
Its fine
Awesome game 10 years old but definitely not outdated Looking forward to GTA VI

Nearly a decade after release Grand Theft Auto V remains an entertaining open world games thanks to its vibrant denselypacked city of Los Santos and a seemingly endless variety of mayhem to unleash The shooting driving and general gameplay still feels great allowing both scripted antics in the campaign and emergent chaos in the streets The story mode delivers an engaging criminal story full of the series trademark humor Where GTA V falls short for some fans is in the map design and online experience While beautiful Los Santos lacks the scale diversity and exploration of previous games like San Andreas The online component also feels soulless with a frustrating grind for money and many aggressive microtransactions pushing shark cards for fast cash Red Dead Redemption 2 shows how a more balanced and thoughtful online experience provides better fan service
i like it

"h1 This city will eat you alive kid h1

If you let it Its a big place full of big dreamers Optimistic artists blind German fashion designers kids fresh out of college trying to convince themselves that their acting degree is worth a fck you name it Its a cutthroat freeforall Every rat in the maze is gonna try to stab you in the back and clamber over your rotting corpse to reach the top of the pile

When I rolled in I was as hopeless as everyone else I got off that plane with nothin but a clean change of clothes and a half empty bottle of bourbon in my carryon Nothin to drive nowhere to stay and not a dollar to my name All I had was Lamar Davis phone number God bless that man He taught me something very important when youre in a maze full of rats you find yourself a pack

I signed on with an individual known simply as The Kewn He had merchandise to move and I had a commercial drivers license It was a match made in a crack den To be honest it was pretty degrading but it put paper in my wallet That paper put my name on a lease a beautiful 72 Saber Turbo in the garage and a Godblessed American firearm in my hand It also bought a tiny little warehouse down on Elysian Island

Every empire starts somewhere amigo Mine started when I was blackout drunk I sunk the chopper carrying my first ever load of cargo into the harbor and somehow managed to drag the crate through the door before the law showed up My assistant found me the next morning passed out in a pool of my own urine

Bit of a bumpy start but that one crate laid the foundation for what I am today baby I clawed my way up to the one percent the oldfashioned way I wasnt a hot girl who cozied up to some fat bald Russian fck with a fifty foot yacht in Ibiza full of ditzy bikiniclad models Nor was I a Harvard dropout whos daddy paid bail after I crashed my third Pegassi into a strip club up to my eyebrows on marching powder

Those Shark Card scum who inherit generational wealth all wind up the same The hot girls get cosmetic surgery in their late forties when their looks start to fade inevitably facing the fact that theyre bland vacant shells of a personalty with nothing but a pair of big pouty lips and a subaverage IQ The Harvard dropouts graduate when papa makes a generous donation to the board and then they use their complimentary finance degree in an attempt to reenact i The Wolf of Wall Street i before they die speedballing 

Point is unlike them my hands are good and dirty Im out there every day flying the choppers rippin eighteenwheelers down the highway and having civilized highcaliber discussions with Merryweather Security Sure I could kick back on my Aquarius and pop champagne corks at passing jetskis every time my account jumps up six figures but Id run out of bottles pretty quick Gets boring after a while

You see I dont i need i to be bustin my ass this hard Anything I could ever want is just a phone call away At this point the only reason to keep playin is for the love of the game

But hey thats what works for me Youve got your whole life ahead of you kiddo and you can waste it however you want Get into professional street racing Skydive off of Mount Chiliad Hunt people for sport Fck it play Arena War if youre some sort of psychopath

Point is you can do whatever You Want

Just dont forget that theres a million other little rats like you

b And theyre i all i hungry b"

some hacker stole my car been waiting over 700 hrs for gm to show up
its gta what more do i say
I mean its alright Like
the campaign is amazing but if you wanna play online you will have the worst experience ever nothing but modders and people wanting to have fun at your expense i only play solo now because the public lobbies are unplayable until rockstar fixes this game i think im gonna stay off of it
Love it
i like shooting people in games

w game
very very fun
its to tryhard
need I say more
"After seeing this scene many times I have realized that Lamars roast is actually incredible By acting as if hes in a hurry and talking quickly he eliminates the opportunity for Franklins counterargument meaning that he can continue delivering his verbal critique

The use of the phrase yeeyee is especially clever as it has very loose meanings and is utilized to further demean Franklin while not being necessarily rude as well as fitting nicely into the rhythm of Lamars smacktalk as the youth say Since a persons hair is usually one of their most standout and noticeable features by ridiculing his Lamar makes Franklins identity feel attacked and being shorter means that hes opened to the perspective of one taller than himself having to look down at it making him especially selfconscious

Furthermore by berating Franklins female partner Lamar starts to get very personal with him which makes the insults even harsher while also making Franklin feel inadequate in romantic relationships As well as this feigning uncertainty of her secret partners occupation and referring to intelligent and respectable vocations such as lawyer and brain surgeon Lamar attacks Franklins lack of a formal education

Finally the strange and belittling way that he calls him the funny n word further aims to make Franklin seems foolish and by slightly squatting to make eye contact Lamar subtly roasts Franklins stature again as well as his status making him feel like an insignificant child

Truly a genius in the art of roasting as the youth say"
I did like best
A beautiful game  totally

this game is amazing it could be a little better but it is perfect

as someone who has played every single gta like every game from the gta franchise this game is good the campaign is awesome online is good but the thing that really amazes me is the fact that u can change characters lol idk why this amazes me but its  really cool graphics is also pretty good despite it being vanilla the physics is good but aint really as good as gta 4s  physics but its good enough and it wont really mark the game as down right unrealistic with the default physics so its decent GTA 5 online is not really as good as the campaign for me becuz im not really interested in playing with other people but the missions and heists in online and the cars is awesome lol and i dont really encounter that much modders anymore so i think rockstar is actually banning them now and actually doing something if youre planning on modding the game please mod it on single player otherwise u will ruin other peoples experience online Overall this game is great 1110 good price for things it offers

"Interested in the story or modded multiplayer Go for it

If youre looking to get into GTA Online save your sanity Compared to a decade ago its in a horrid state First off youre no longer playing GTA when youre in multiplayer youre playing a scifi version of Just Cause 3 on an unholy amount of steroids as you prevent World War 3 essentially Additionally everythings gotten far more expensive to encourage microtransactions if you dont want to deal with the abysmal grind and theres even a subscription service now The anticheat is utterly terrible cant even join a single session without someone or several people using cheat scripts for the sole purpose of ruining everyones day No IP address protection either Only time the game gets a hotfix is to patch money exploits anything else hardly ever gets touched

TLDR Singleplayer is good online is awful"

"GTA V The Loveable Old Grandpa Still Kickin While We Wait for GTA 6

Oh boy where do I even start with this gem GTA V is like that beloved old uncle whos been crashing on your couch for way too longstill stealing the spotlight hogging the TV remote and making you laugh despite overstaying its welcome

Lets talk about the game Its like the eternal loop of chaos and shenanigans Youve got Michael Trevor and Franklinthese dudes are like the dysfunctional family members you secretly wish were part of your squad in real life Michael the retired bank robber turned family man Trevor the dude you wouldnt want to be left alone with your snacks and Franklin the guy youd trust to parallel park your car blindfolded

The world of Los Santos is still more alive than my houseplants and trust me that says a lot You can be a responsible citizen driving obeying traffic lights or you can hijack a blimp fly over the city and make a heartfelt speech to the seagulls Your call

But lets address the elephant in the room or should I say the lack thereof Hey Rockstar wheres GTA 6 Did you misplace it under a pile of cash or something Were here twiddling our thumbs waiting for the next big thing while youre probably brainstorming ways to make us rob casinos on Mars

But back to GTA Vdespite its age its holding up better than my attempts at adulting The graphics might not be cutting edge anymore but the storytelling Still topnotch The multiplayer A haven for both chaos and camaraderie And lets not forget the mods because turning every car into a screaming flamingo or replacing the cops with angry chickens Pure gold

So here we are giving this game yet another thumbsup while simultaneously sideeyeing Rockstar for keeping us in suspense about GTA 6 Come on guys spill the beans already Until then Ill be in Los Santos probably doing yoga on top of a moving train or trying to make friends with a gang of wandering llamas"

Ive played this game dozens of times even achieving every trophy on PS4 yes including the criminal mastermind Ive invested in this game at least seven times spanning across platforms such as PS3 PS4 X360 SeriesX and three times on PC and Ive never regretted a single purchase Undoubtedly it stands as the most prestigious game of the last decade and I sincerely hope its successor will be at least half as impressive A heartfelt thank you to Rockstar Games for creating this truly greatest of all games

I am a 45 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father raising my son who is now 14 years old My son won this game from his uncle so we installed him on his computer and he started playing Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game This was horrible for me because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him I bought the game chose my skin and world and started playing but I was stuck in what you should do I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate I loved it because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died Since then this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well This game reminded me that there is fun in everything and I brought many happy memories to me and my son

I like how the other reviews sound like Wikipedia articles Heres an actual review from an actual person If you said that GTA V is the best game of all time I wouldnt argue with you What Rockstar did for gaming with this absolute masterpiece cannot be understated Were still playing it religiously 10 years after it came out One decade Let that sink in The use of three protagonists was a great idea and really branched out this game in ways weve never seen before Getting three different perspectives on the same story is extremely interesting Each of the protagonists holds their own Trevor is easily one of my favorite protagonists ever I love the Al Pacino vibe that Michael gives off and Franklins journey is awesome to see The gameplay is topnotch I love the gunplay and the driving is stellar its much better than the boat steering from GTA 4 The story is incredible there isnt much of an emotional attachment but its still extremely compelling and can easily last for multiple playthroughs I replay this game once a year because I love it so much The map is one of the best out there and theres a reason its used when judging the maps of new games Online is a completely different story its toxic and payto win Its fun with friends but random lobbies are awful Overall GTA V is a 55 Theres really nothing that can bring down the score

"Grand Theft Auto V is the absolute kingpin of openworld gaming and Rockstar Games has truly crafted a timeless epic thats still rocking it

Los Santos is more than just a city its a sprawling playground where every neighborhood has its own story to tell From the glitz of Vinewood to the streets of Grove the attention to detail is mindblowing making every corner worth exploring

The trio of main characters is a genius move Michael Franklin and Trevor bring unique vibes to the story and being able to switch between them seamlessly adds a layer of immersion that keeps things interesting

The story itself is a wild ride of heists twists and Rockstars trademark satire on society The writing is sharp the voice acting is spoton and the cinematic presentation gives the whole narrative a blockbuster feel

And lets not forget GTA Online  its a whole new world of criminal opportunities Building your empire pulling off heists with friends or just causing chaos theres always something to do The regular updates keep the online experience feeling fresh and unpredictable

The gameplay mechanics are topnotch The driving feels responsive the combat is satisfying and the range of activities from serious heists to absurd yoga sessions adds that extra layer of GTA charm The soundtrack is a mixtape of perfection that sets the mood just right

Sure the graphics show a bit of wear and tear considering the games age but the overall design and vibe of Los Santos still make it a visual treat

In a nutshell Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece of gaming The massive world memorable characters and the freedom to dive into chaos or follow the story make it a mustplay Despite its years the games still got that magic touch making it a timeless classic that stands tall in the gaming hall of fame"
its a good game to play with frinds but you cant play it  alone becuse it boring
dis gem soo gud yal mus try
"I really enjoyed Grand Theft Auto V on release and I still really like the graphics soundtrack and the overall gameplay I find that the driving in particular is very enjoyable and I dont normally care about driving in games The story is weak and focuses heavily on a funding war between two government agencies despite it being obvious that the interactions between the three main characters are far more interesting 

However over time it has become harder to recommend Rockstar is clearly making an absolute fortune from the online mode and thus has focused all postrelease development on this mode instead of doing any singleplayer DLCs Unfortunately the online mode is predatory in the same way that many mobile games are and deliberately drags out the progression with long wait timers big money grinds and other artificial barriers designed to encourage players to buy ingame money with real currency to speed the process up 

Many features in the online game such as the ability to insure custom cars and have them delivered to you are exclusive to online play when they almost feel like basic features which should be present in singleplayer mode A lot of content including literally hundreds of cars and weapons are exclusive to online play as well Even worse  as this has gone on the file size of the install has increased to match it and you cannot install single player only  it was around 50GB when I first got it and now sits at 110GB This game could be amazing to play offline but Rockstar are fixated on herding players into their online mode in order to milk them for cash"

"The prices youve applied to Turkey seem like a joke As a country we didnt switch to the dollar Steam switched to the dollar to keep prices stable in Turkey and prevent constant fluctuations What you should have done was convert the price you applied to us into dollars In other words the price would have remained the same and we would have purchased it in dollars This was what Steam communicated to us Despite knowing our low purchasing power you would never make sales at these prices You cant manipulate Turkish gamers in this way Good luck

Türkiyeye uyguladığınız fiyatlar adeta bir şaka gibi Ülke olarak biz dolar sistemine geçmedik Steam Türkiyede fiyatları sabit tutmak ve sürekli dalgalanmayı önlemek için dolara geçti Yapmanız gereken şey bize uyguladığınız fiyatı dolara çevirmekti Yani fiyat aynı olacaktı sadece dolar olarak satın alacaktık Bu Steamin bize ilettiği bilgiydi Düşük alım gücümüzü bilmenize rağmen bu fiyatlarla asla satış yapmazsınız Türk oyuncularını bu şekilde manipüle edemezsiniz İyi şanslar"

used to be a fun sandbox game until rockstar decided sharkcards were more important then having fun adding killboxes during map glitches and vehicles no longer being able to go into ammunation they just want to remove any aspect thats a sandbox like fun thing
the game is better than playing it on consoles you can play online for free which i totally like and you can use mods for cars and servers which in certain standards is cool i recommend this game to many people who love to play gta v online or have not tried online yet and wants to give it a go

"TLDR
Great game worth it for 15

Graphics 8210

Story 810

Freedom 9610

Capitalism 1310

As always its GTA so of course it will be nearly perfect in the realm of RPGActionAdventure games Its a huge AAA title so its going to have some bugs even 10 years or more after release but that doesnt detract from the perfection that is the GTA series Theres a reason its one of the most wellknown RPG games on the market 

I havent experienced anything game breaking from playing it on Xbox 360 Xbox One Series X and now PC Its well worth it for 15 during the Autumn Steam Sale but I dont see myself paying 30 or 50 for the game  DLC contentmoney shark cards Just buy the premium edition for 15 and spend a day or two grinding in online mode if you want the 4m from the shark card save that cash"

The story of i GTA V i is so masterfully crafted I dont know where to start The story from start to finish is AMAZING much like i Grand Theft Auto 4s i story The only thing that makes i GTA Vs i story a tiny bit better is the fact that the story never really gets repetitive which was my only gripe with i GTA 4s i story The fact that theres 3 main characters all with different backstories and fully fleshed out is amazing as well 
h3 Endings h3
In this subchapter Im going to discuss the endings of the games so if you dont want spoilers the rest will be blacked out using the spoilers feature spoiler The 3 endings of the game are all meaningful in their own right 2 of the 3 endings involving Franklin killing one of the 2 other main characters Michael or Trevor The third ending being the Deathwish ending sees Franklin save both Michael and Trevor from being killed The Deathwish ending is personally my favorite ending as it is the most actionpacked ending of the entire game spoiler

h1 GTA Online h1
i GTA Online i on PC is very dangerous to play at the moment due to hackers and IP grabbers however the console version Xbox One PS4 Xbox Series XS and PS5 is really fun to play with friends However public lobbies are not worth going into because in my experience getting griefed every 10 seconds by a level 1000 gets annoying after a while

h1 Modding Community h1
The modding community for PC is amazing Theres many fun mods out there to play my favorite being i LSPDFR i which is one of the most popular i Grand Theft Auto V i mods of all time Theres another mod named i FiveM i which is also popular amongst Twitch streamers Theres multiple ways to mod and manipulate the game and I suggest doing that once youve beat the story mode

h1 Final Thoughts h1
This game in my humble and honest opinion is the SECOND best i Grand Theft Auto i game the first being i Grand Theft Auto 4 i if that wasnt obvious already However if I were to rate the game on a scale from 110 Id give it a 8510 due to the Online mode being unplayable on PC and somewhat unpleasant on console Anyways if you enjoyed reading this lengthy review please leave a like saying the review was helpful Also I hope this review helped you make your decision on whether or not you wanted to buy this game"
No Sex
Its full of cheaters just like RDR2O I also hate the Character Creation like RDR2O is infinitely better then GTAO and another issue with it for me is that RS will not do anything new until this thing ends so nobody buy it please

I was introduced to this game by my law enforcement father Im still committing crimes IN THIS GAME 10 years later

"The captcha challenge failed to load Please check your network connection and try again

Tried so many methods I could find on the internet but nothing worked All rockstar games in my steam library turns digital garbage because cannot login"
"Used to be my fav game but now hackers rule the game Rockstar is just minting money from game sales and addons they are not interested in making any kind of anticheat layer in the game 
I am done with this game"
stuff
really fun
love it
Due to Take Two Interactive the franchise is going down the drain Take Two Initiative has set down most of the major mods that have supported the game if you are thinking that you want to play things like zombies for example it is no longer working with modders leaving and retiring Rockstar has been putting antimodding programs together to shut down the modding community while at the same time saying we support modding while being responsible for shutting down the modding platform for GTA A lot of people are going to have to be fired because they are actively bringing the company down as shown by their actions contradicting their words

your average night in gta online will consist of grinding for real life hours or even days on a 4 million dollar business thing only to lose it all in a second because some 14 year old fuckhead thought it would be funny to go god mode and blow up your shit
This game is good for people who seek for a pleasure of successful and also for strategy and story enjoyer I would rate it 810
Its very fun
it is definitely a game
its gta
pvp take life over
Nice
Awesome possum

Apart from the negative of Rockstars notorious greed GTAO is also absolutely infested with hackers Ive played it since the day it was available on PS3 to the few who could connect and I love the game but this version has a lot of irritating problems that make it hard to recommend to new players
good game
i like the violence
it is super to play with friends it is a must buy
Dont recommend In my own experience I can barely play the game without people modding spawn killing and just ruining the game for me the game is nice though

"This is a little late but I cant believe how bad this game has become 

Everythings paytoplay Shark cards are expensive as hell despite the game originally costing like 50 Even if you have enough money to buy vehicles youre not allowed to buy them until you fulfill some garbage prerequisite This game is nothing but a money maker for Rockstar and its just utter trash 

If you want to just have fun and not get killed by randos you have to play FiveM Hackers are STILL a rampant issue but god forbid you get money from one cause youll be punished for it Trying to join up on friends online the game constantly errors out and kicks you back into single player or different server While trying to run if you happen to accidentally go too near to a mission or whatever itll take you into the mission without you wanting to and leaving it trying to get out of it kicks you out of the server sometimes 

Thanks for turning this game into absolute garbage Rockstar Ive always loved the series but you have officially made this entirely unplayable 

GTA6 is going to look great and seem like a good idea but I know its going to the same nonsense but more expensive I hate this game with every fiber in my being"
i love the grafix
Good
great
really good game but there is bad laguge do recomend
Time
modderss make the game fun if u talk to the 1010
I have played this game for almost 7 years and its amazing
Story mode is great obviously but online is a sht show Cheaters in literally every single lobby multiple cheaters who will go out of their way to ruin your day terrorize you until youre forced to leave Cheaters will also disconnect you from online crash your game etc There is almost no reason to grind for cash as you can just have some skank ass modder give you money or you could just buy a mod menu You literally cannot report people who are cheating as the cheaters can intercept these reports and even see who filed a report and then subsequently crash your game Screw R for allowing this cheating epidemic to just run rampant It just baffles me how R can neglect such a large portion of their player base what a shtty developer Shame on you R

"Grand Theft Auto is a series of actionadventure games created by David Jones and Mike Dailly2 Later titles were developed under the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut It is primarily developed by British development house Rockstar North formerly DMA Design and published by its American parent company Rockstar Games The name of the series is a term for motor vehicle theft in the United States

Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can complete missions to progress an overall story as well as engage in various side activities Most of the gameplay revolves around driving and shooting with occasional roleplaying and stealth elements The series also has elements of the earlier beat em up games from the 16bit era The games in the Grand Theft Auto series are set in fictional locales modelled after reallife cities at various points in time from the early 1960s to the 2010s The original games map encompassed three citiesLiberty City based on New York City San Andreas based on San Franciscoa and Vice City based on Miamibut later titles tend to focus on a single setting and expand upon the original three locales Each game in the series centres on different respective protagonist who attempts to rise through the criminal underworld due to various motives often accompanying themes of betrayal Several film and music veterans have voiced characters in the games including Ray Liotta Dennis Hopper Samuel L Jackson William Fichtner James Woods Debbie Harry Axl Rose and Peter Fonda3

DMA Design began the series in 1997 with the release of the Grand Theft Auto As of 2020 the series consists of seven standalone titles and four expansion packs The third main title Grand Theft Auto III released in 2001 is considered a landmark game and brought the series into a threedimensional environment for the first time Subsequent titles have followed and built upon the format established by Grand Theft Auto III receiving significant acclaim The games influenced other openworld games and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar titles4

The series has been critically acclaimed with all the main 3D entries in the franchise frequently ranked among the greatest and bestselling video games5 it has shipped more than 405 million units making it one of the bestselling video game franchises In 2006 Grand Theft Auto was featured in a list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum6 In 2013 The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britains most successful exports7 The series has also been controversial for its adult nature and violent themes as well as for cut content"

DO NOT BUY GAMES FROM ROCKSTAR A hacker recently stole my Social Club account for GTA V And you need this account to even play the single player game because of their horrible DRM And so I contacted their support and they refused to help me get my Social Club account back So now I can never play this game ever again with this Steam account What a waste of money Yeah GTA V is a good game but that doesnt matter if anytime a hacker can steal the game from you because Rockstar doesnt care about their customers

"Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base Their appearance as a common plant was in the midCretaceous period There are 12000 species now3

A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks Grass is usually the color green That is because they are windpollinated rather than insectpollinated so they do not have to attract insects Green is the best colour for photosynthesis

Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant cover 405 of the land area of the Earth except Greenland and Antarctica4

Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants They include the grass of the family Poaceae which are called grass by ordinary people This family is also called the Gramineae and includes some of the sedges Cyperaceae and the rushes Juncaceae5 These three families are not very closely related though all of them belong to clades in the order Poales They are similar adaptations to a similar lifestyle

With about 780 genera and about 12000 species3 the Poaceae is the fifthlargest plant family Only the Asteraceae Orchidaceae Fabaceae and Rubiaceae have more species6

The true grasses include cereals bamboo and the grasses of lawns turf and grassland Uses for graminoids include food as grain shoots or rhizomes drink beer whisky pasture for livestock thatch paper fuel clothing insulation construction sports turf basket weaving and many others

Many grasses are short but some grasses can grow tall such as bamboo Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands including areas which are very arid or cold There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such but are not members of the grass family These plants include rushes reeds papyrus and water chestnut Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales

Grasses are an important food for many animals such as deer buffalo cattle mice grasshoppers caterpillars and many other grazers Unlike other plants grasses grow from the bottom so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows7 This is a part of why the plants are successful Without grass soil may wash away into rivers erosion"

"Do you like having things stolen Like all of the hard earned money you were trying to cash out What about your entire account Better yet what about your private IP address

Well with GTA V you can put all of these things at risk of being taken just by playing the game

No but seriously dont touch this shit I do not care about the quality of their games Stop supporting this company People around the world are having major parts of their privacy stolen just by trying to play this game because Rockstar cant be bothered to spend money on having any kind of working network security"

Ive been playing this game since it came out Throughout the years it has been fun Every once in a while you would get an update to make the game more fun but since 2020 the game has gone down hill You got the sense that rockstar was beating a dead horse to get more income for minimal work In the last year i would give it a 1 out of 100 I have played the online mode for the last couple months averaging about 50 hours a week EVERY SINGLE LOBBY has a modder that is unregulated that kills you transports you griefs you and literally makes the game unplayable I WOULD NOT recommend this game to anyone anymore
very fun
Its GTA dont wait
frunking amazing
"although im a new player i love everything about it its super cooli am ashamed of myself for not buying gta5
earlier and with gta 6 about to come idk what to do"
Loved the game though im alone Looking for other people to play with especially filipinos i want my own kind and others aswell
Dog shit
Really disappointed with GTA V on PC in 2023 It started as a console port where all the design elements were still focused around controlling the game with a console controller Eight years later none of the problems caused by the console port have been fixed There are also still extremely long loading times for every load screen no matter the PCs performance On top of this multiplayer is near impossible because of the number of people who are able to run scripts and cheats in multiplayer without penalty As I said these have been issues since the games release on PC but never fixed Instead they keep pumping out more and more boring missions and game modes and ever more ridiculous vehicles and weapons to try sell the game to new players or so existing players will buy RP Its evident this company is not interested in retaining players longterm its just a pumpanddump strategy Im done
"قبابف

its very good
"I know its 10 years old

I love the realism in the game sooo true to life If this had stars I would put 1010
really good game i def recommend its so fun in online
One of the best games of all time
Very toxic game and a lot of cheaters
Let it be clear that I was NOT offered 15000000000 GTA dollaps by a guy named Sanz on discord and I do NOT recommend taking that ALLEGED deal if you happen to come across it
Simple 010 for their shitty malfunctioning and incredibly annoying Rockstar games launcher
good game not in bad sport tho

"FiveM the game or asset pack

Big Psa 

Do NOT play on the official gta online servers UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES because it is full of ippullersddosers and hackers that can seriously mess your pcR account up R keeps pushing monetisation practices and all sorts of nonsense grind while never addressing the hacker problems leaving everyone exposed to all sorts of trouble due to low security

However as it stands now if you really want to play gta in multiplayer then stick to using FiveM to play"
AWESOME GAME
hey good game

love this game

The entire rockstar launcher program that goes with the game ruins the game I cant even get my account back because it magically linked to another account Plus if I wanted to make a new one they dont let you If you unlink your steam with the rockstar launcher you can never play online again Theres also no way to look up what email you used to connect your steam to rockstar launcher Bruh this game came out 8 years ago I was a kid when I setup this rockstar bs Atleast let me update my info so I can play online again Once they allow you to relink your steam to the launcher this game is unplayable for me

神作不用解释
"The story is so good singleplayer campaign is excellent GTA Online tho skip if you can not much is really worth as you can only grind so many things that ACTUALLY make you enough money to run heists Also rockstar milking GTA duh along with the number of cooldowns that are in this mode make it more of a slog to play 

Basegame is fair and touching online is filled with hackers yes you will be autobooted into a PUBLIC lobby after any activity even if in an invite only session and has a far slower pace that makes you wish it was just a co op version of the singleplayer campaign"
its decent gta iv is the goat still

"If youre thinking about picking this up to have some fun with GTA Online DONT Get it for console if you really have an itch to play Online is currently next to unplayable for any normal gamer due to the rampant cheaters which the community calls modders for some stupid reason Whats worse is that Rockstar does next to nothing about it 

98 of the time you will run into a cheater in your server or whatever game modes you like to play The only question will be whether they just like to mess with server config stuff like making all NPCs aggressive or making any nearby vehicles despawn or more malicious stuff like insta killing you for no reason teleporting you to an inescapable room so they can kill you One thing is for sure even the good natured modders will kill you if you try for an objective or to do anything really 
They use invincibility fly around can blow you up out of nowhere pop the tires on your car repeatedly spawn vehicles on top of you bombard you with invisible semi trucks send you to a menu that is only leavable by altf4ing which tries to download godknowswhat 
I have not had a single session where I was able to just enjoy the game get fair fights or even have a chance to accomplish anything If you do it is just by the good graces of the hackers that literally run the game and most of the time they will ruin your experience just to be cancerous 

Also worth noting that almost all of my online achievements were forced on me by a hacker I upset so he found all of the packages movie probs easter eggs etc on my account and instantly boosted me Again game ruined by hacking lowlifes that just want to ruin this game for people 

TLDR Online is unplayable because Rockstar doesnt care about the PC community and lets cheaters run the game however they want The cheaters main goal is to make the game entirely unplayable for any normal gamer someone not using cheats"
good
Nice Game Good
No not recommended If your connection sucks pls dont play this game You will be frustrated with the bugs and glitch in the game Moreover There are a lots of hackers Thus connections problem it is the worst problem here i have played a while and i have stuck with connection problem It is causing my game to crash glitching and bugging

Well I m playing in 2024 but the game was my dream from 7th grade and I even dont know about the story line I just need to drive cars and crash it but as a mature person Michael character was a good character in my thought because he tries to be a family person in a best way the previous rockstar games like vice Citysan Andreas and gta 4 are focused on gangster but these game has a little bit reality of a person so anyways I m eagerly waiting for GTA 6 all ways a fan for rockstar

"GTA 5 is an unparalleled openworld experience that has absorbed me for over 2000 hours Rockstar Games has created a masterpiece that continues to captivate players with its expansive world diverse gameplay and engaging narrative

The sheer scale of Los Santos is mindboggling every corner brims with life from bustling city streets to the serene countryside The attention to detail is impeccable making exploration a constant delight Whether engaging in highspeed chases completing intricate heists or simply soaking in the vibrant environment theres always something new to discover

The trio of protagonists adds depth and variety to the gameplay each with their own distinct personality and storyline The missions are diverse offering a perfect balance of action strategy and adrenalinepumping moments

The multiplayer mode GTA Online is a world in itself The everexpanding content ranging from heists to races and businesses ensures that boredom is a foreign concept The community aspect coupled with the constant updates makes for an evolving and dynamic online experience

However despite its brilliance GTA 5 isnt without flaws Occasionally certain missions might feel repetitive and the online experience can be affected by occasional glitches or connectivity issues Yet these minor setbacks are overshadowed by the games overall brilliance

After thousands of hours GTA 5 remains a pinnacle of gaming excellence Its immersive world engaging gameplay and limitless possibilities make it a timeless classic that continues to draw me back for more"

"In the grandiose tapestry of interactive entertainment one gem gleams with a brilliance that transcends mere virtual escapades  Grand Theft Auto V a magnum opus that encapsulates the epitome of digital storytelling and openworld immersion This opulent masterpiece birthed from the creative crucible of Rockstar Games is nothing short of a symphony of pixels orchestrating an exquisite ballet of chaos and consequence in the sprawling sunkissed canvas of Los Santos

From the very moment one steps into the ethereal realm of GTA V the senses are immediately ensnared by a sensory feast of visual grandeur The opulent sunsets that bathe the cityscape in hues so vivid they seem painted by the celestial brushstrokes of a digital deity The meticulous attention to detail a testament to the virtuosity of the games artisans crafts a metropolis that breathes with a life uncannily mirroring reality

Yet it is not merely the aesthetic allure that propels GTA V into the echelons of gaming grandeur it is the opulent tapestry of narrative finesse that truly sets it apart The trio of protagonists Michael Franklin and Trevor form a trinity of diverse tales intricately interwoven each narrative strand a sublime sonnet in the cacophonous ballad of crime and consequence The dialogue a linguistic ballet is a marriage of wit and grit a melange that elevates the narrative to operatic heights

The openworld dynamism of GTA V is nothing short of a technological marvel an expansive sandbox where every alley conceals a clandestine narrative and every street corner harbors the potential for mayhem The vehicular symphony a cacophony of roaring engines and screeching tires becomes a visceral heartbeat pulsating through the veins of Los Santos

Amidst this digitized ballet of chaos the satirical genius of Rockstar Games unfurls like a velvet cloak of wit The radio stations an eclectic mosaic of musical genres and comedic satire mirror the vibrant tapestry of Los Angeles seamlessly blending the surreal with the uncomfortably familiar

In the annals of gaming history GTA V stands as an impenetrable colossus a testament to the boundless potential of interactive storytelling It is not merely a game it is a transcendent experience a symphony of chaos consequence and digital virtuosity that resonates with an indelible imprint upon the soul of the gaming connoisseur Grand Theft Auto V is not just a title it is a magnum opus an opulent crown jewel in the diadem of interactive artistry

someone linked their social club account to my steam account and now i am not able to play any games made by rockstar how am i not protected from someone linking their account to my steam everytime i try to launch a rocstar game it literally refuses to let me use my own email and tries to force me to log in to that random guys email but how can i when i dont know the password to a random persons email and i cant even see the full email becasue it is censored
I have been playing this game since a long time and I am still playing it one of the best game to play never bores you

GREAT MASTERPIECE BY ROCKSTAR 
ITS BEEN LONG TIME  I AM PLAYING THIS GAME IT IS FABULOUSLY DESIGNED GAME WITH HIGH GRAPHICS AND REALISM IT IS WORTH TO PLAY THIS GAME FROM CHILDHOOD GTA IS ONE OF THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE ITS CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT AND ADDED NEW FEATURES  MISSIONS MAPS ACTIVITIES WITH TRUE REALISM MAKES ME FEEL EXCITED EVERY TIME EVERY ONE SHOULD PLAY THIS FABULOUS GAME I LOVE GTA

Play GTA before you talk to me
""

VERY GOOOOOOOD FIVEM

THIS GAME SUCKS I SPENT SO MUCH ON IT FOR IT TO NOT EVEN OPEN
Its fun to play
"So what to say
I LOVE THIS GAME its like playing three games in one Game
First there is GTA 5 online You can chat with players and complete Heists Missions and Robberies You can play in an open World big as two cities 
Then there is Gta Story Mode The varied Stories of the three different characters are breathtaking and adventurous I have only got 38 hours in but im excited to play more as I am only at 19 percent
At last there are different Events like Haunted Halloween or InGameEvents like JunkEnergy Motorcycle Events
So you have like Racing Shooting Robbing and multiplayer in just one game
I highly recommend this Game for people who dont know where to spend their money next and who cant decide on EgoShooter Racing and Action Heists or Robberies
So feel free to buy it
THX"

You Forget A Thousand Things Every Day How About You Make Sure This Is One Of Em"
nice
made me racist
if you didnt play this game on the 360ps3 as a kid and are thinking about using your newly acquired adult money to try it out then by all means please do so ive put about 300 hrs both on a nonsteam version and console versions combined online is p shit on pc but honestly its worth it genuinely a good game with a good development of the characters within it and its still on par with gta iv and gta san andreas for me
well made game i just like it
controls still clunky as hell literally just had a property mission become unavailable the second i showed up on site after having the taxi drop me off at the wrong spot and trying to use the clunky controls trying to drive up to the spot why is the taxi an option if it doesnt do what its supposed to do i get its an old game but come on
IT IS A GOOD GAME
"I have never played a game so completely infested with hackers as GTA It is absolutely inexcusable for a game to be this popular and put such little effort into curbing the rampant hacking I dont understand how they can continue to sell the product and shark cards while providing such a horrible user experience

Do not play this game on PC unless you plan to play in a private lobby with just your friends Do not listen to the people claiming you can just kill the hackers until they leave as they have multiple ways to hide who they are 

Play the game on console where they actually curb the cheating"
gta6gta6gta6gta6gta6gta6gta6gta6gta6 like this so that when you come back to this 9 years from now itll seem like gta6 went by like a flash
At some point my social club got linked to the wrong email address Anyway I tried resetting it and tried everything to allow my social club to log in but because it never would I couldnt play the game So stupid It wont even let you play normal GTA
great game i love how the consoole skills transfer over to pc and i poop on wanna be modder tryuhards
ITS VERY VERY GOOD GAME IN GAME INDUSTERY
Play it Its worth the investment
I love this game Trevor is so hot
Very good
Good game aside from all the modders and hackers occasionally get banned for nothing like i did
war crimes are allowed i recommend
good
amazing game but gta online is mid
online modders
YES
"Rockstar please dont let us down with GTA VI
This game is a solid 910 it itches every single thing a GTA player could ever ask for 
Fast paced action around every corner if you so wish Shoot up everyone with any weapon you could imagine get yourself wanted take any car you could dream of and drive around like a maniac go to the stripclup and enjoy the cough
or you know
just take a walk and enjoy the sceneries Up to you"
For the deal they are throwing out there if you dont have it buy it immediately just bought to start playing on modded servers
Been out for damn near a decade and still has bugs that completely break missions come on rockstar

"well pretty much coding sux for gta 5 devs dont know how to run game get me in there as modadmin

On the bright side of things 999 slot servers now thanks to fivem only took about 16 years 

 cant wait for gta 6  right guys  go joe  

hope better coding next time 


 nostradomas"
i love it
188 fps and random stuttering with top high end PC
Michael De Santa Simulator teh Fifth
I personally like the single player story but online is just a wasteland Everything takes 2000 years to grind for and it is just a time sink And there are SO many microtransactions Also RDR2 made me realized how overrated this game is That game has a far better developed story imo and it does not get a fraction of the attention that GTA V does GTA V is not bad by any means and this game was a milestone at the time it was made but I still feel that this game gets far too much praise I will likely finish the story campaign but that is about all I will likely do in this game The reason I am giving this a negative review is because most of the content in this game is on GTA online and you already know my opinion on that Feel free to disagree with me on all of this but this game is just not for me I am not saying the game is bad but online needs to seriously be fixed with all of the hacking excessive grinding etc
gut
Great game
it really really good
the theft of autos was V grand idk
Recommend the game to people
The game works well on the Steam Deck whoever wants to play this on the Steam Deck will be suprised with how you can ramp the settings up to high and still have 30 fps or higher
Remove hackers and modders and this game is good
i am 68 years old and have been playing GTA since it 1st came out I usually play with friends my age and we have many ways of playing the game but always in the INVITE ONLY as we were tired of dealing with younger players that only wanted to kill other players We take turns doing missions together and do all the deliveries as a team
poo poo stinky fart
yeaaaaaaaaaa
fum
this is the best game
Pretty fun i guess story is fun online is pretty unplayable in the modern age but fun i guess
The game is fantastic I think everything should be accessible from the start The buildings should be accessible at least
Is good
we got gta 5 before gta 6 
Let me get those h0k3r
The only thing thats missing is the smell of gunpowder blood and burning flesh
this game has the best strip club
I played the game since it came out on all platforms by now Waiting for gta six
BEST GAME
good
there is a reason this is one of the best selling games of all time
"A damn car fell from the sky right into my leg i had to go to a hospital i had to pay 5000 dollars to the hospital then i walked to the road in front of the hospital when i saw a truck coming it was to late the dude ran over me then got to hospital again This infernal cicle kept going for like 5 days
After all that i went home and i got GTA 5 to play
Anyways cool game"
its a good and cool game but not a game for kids
just love
enjoy like an a reallife
I went to buy some jordans i ended up getting two womens

"Pirated the base game 6 months ago and it worked like a charm
Bought it for the first time and crashes after 10 mins

1010 True Rockstar Games Experience"
for you
fsadsa
its a blur of login get in a session with a modder get 1 million for free modder leaves a level 3000 incel with his mk2 comes and deletes you rinse and repeat
yes
Genuinely baffling that this game makes any money at this point I am grateful that it doesnt launch for me anymore Any criticism I can give has been said already If you want to get into this game do heroin instead Literally do heroin or start gambling if you want the GTA online experience You will gain more from doing doing heroin than playing GTA online I would rather have both my arms and legs blown off by an IED in Ukraine than play this game again Cant wait for GTA VI baby
NICE GAME I REALLY LOVE THIS ONE
"God awful I hate how grindy GTA online and story mode is Point A to Point B all the time

Anyways I recommend"
good game
this game is very good
good
I love this game but the hackers are sometime so irritating if I ignored those hackers then this is the best open world game and also the most playing game in my library
game is good
guchi
orayt
game
no this is due to my single player getting randomly corrupted other than that its alright
Just recommended game and bought so many copies of the game Will buy more 6 copies when Gta 6 comes out
"Best piece of advice 

Kosatka 

Grind as much as you can to get one then watch speedruns on how to do the heist Then watch the mulah come in like a tranny on onlyfans Ehh its hard to grind 2 million bucks Do odd jobs join other heists do whatever promo Rockstar has just get that Submarine Trust me its worth it 

Reviewwise theres alotta cheatersmodders with mod menus but just go into passive mode or change server they wont bother you Some modders will even help you out in heists or events so I cant complain Dont take PVP seriously you wont gain anything from it Take note purchasing a car is GRINDY AF 

For reference
Average Low Level Heist Payout 300k500k
Bootleg Toyota Supra Around 790k"

rather splendid if i do say so myself

"Absolutely abysmalnonexistant customer service 

I cannot play my own legally purchased game because I once was forced to sign up for the social club years ago on an email address that no longer exists There is no customer service phone number there is but its literally a recording to tell you to go through the website 

There is no live chat You have to go through these categories to even let it let you contact customer support via email They did finally respond to my request about a day and a half later then asked me to confirm I wanted to proceed and now its been 2 more days and I still havent heard back 

I just want to play a single player game That I own I dont want anything to do with any online anything with this game I just wanted to run over some hookers in 4k on my day off 

This is the most cowardly customer service system I have ever seen"

GTA 5 is the game of all times Me personally with 515 hours can say that it is one of if not the best game i have played it resembles real life so much yet it is so fun that it is mind blowing to say such a masterpiece is bad i recommend this game to everyone And i cant wait to play even more so if you are thinking about playing it u dont have to think any longer u should 100 play it The online mode is full of fun missions and heists that are very fun solo and even funner with friends in one word the game is just amazing
good game thats all i have to say

"Honestly its a fun game I find GTA Online enjoyable Ive spent enough time to rack up millions and still have fun without getting bored friends are fun to have and coordinate heists with dont want to deal with griefers just go into inviteonly Do need money and a new car complete Daxs story hell you even get a business that you can start with the money you make Im honestly skimming over so much but thats just because of how much content there is to do and see it might get boring after being poor but do not for the love of god spend real money on this game besides buying it just watch Rags To Riches from TGG I hope this helped you make an educated purchase on the GTA Online aspect

As far as story goes its a must play like all Rockstar games stories the story is well crafted and made worth playing with multiple endings"

Love playing Grand Theft Auto games especially Grand Theft Auto 5 This game is by far the best game Ive actually played on PC yet It runs on my ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 without any issues The only problem I have with this game is that how overwhelmingly difficult the missions are But overall from a scale from 110 Ill rate this game a 1010 This game has awesome graphics and is has very realistic game play than any other Grand Theft Auto game I played yet This is such a improvement from Grand Theft Auto 4 Thank you Rockstar games for bring this game to the table and offering more fun ways to play I recommend this game 100

its a fun and good game im probly gonna play it a lot more so yeah i recomend your play this game
this needs so much updating needing more than two players for a heist or mission is ridiculous because it takes longer than 20 minutes to get random players to join which makes the game frustrating as fuck when you do get matched its somebody hacking and killing teammates for no reason thanks rockstar you can suck my big fat hairy balls for that one theres no option to choose a switch controller really awesome when you cant figure out controls for flying third person controls are beyond fucked up trying to use a ladder go fuck yourself and taking away the cows was a massive punch in the dick WAA WAA WE DONT WANT PLAYERS PUNCHING COWS TO MAX OUT STRENGTH WAAA WE HATE OUR PLAYERS  rockstar thanks for coming to my ted talk fuck this game imma keep playing until i kill myself tho

Best gta game ive played now to Trry GTA VI
90 of the buildings are not enterable the cars are not realistic enough bullets go through car door metal this game isnt realistic enough As for online if I wanted to play forklift driving simulator Id just go get a forklift job GTA 4 had better car physics and rag doll physics the modding community is toxic and the rp players are nitpicks that never seem to go outside Other than that OK game The good thing about this game is the story Online just sucks

its fun
modern day age pew pew haha
Its a cool classic game that everyone knows and loves
game is unplayable if youre looking to play public online its ruined by a bunch of lifeless nerds that call themselves modders cus cheater sounds too bad for them game has been out for a decade and to this day rockstar has done completely nothing about it for a game thats been out for this long the content is pretty lacking and updates very minimal they only care about profit which is why they nerf the shit out of certain heists so you cant gain as much and increase the prices on cars by millions just so the stupid people support this horrible company and buy the overpriced shark cards that are not worth the money in the slightest the only way i find this game fun is playing story or only in private lobbies with friends since online is pretty boring solo and rockstar pretty much is against solo since theres barely any solo content
this game  sucks
THE GAME WONT START
Love this game
Very Good Game
I dont understand the hype around this game After 4 hours I feel like Ive seen most of whats to offer in this game and its sad Vice City was a better game and it was over a decade ago The character swap feature is lost on me as Id rather have a character who better represents me than swapping between all these annoying characters
Still one of the best games ever
What an incredible game I grew up with it and definitely blown away by how far its all come
gta online is the thing i play
Its full of hackers almost unplayable for those who play the game legit and have purchased money in the game it show the lack of care by rockstar not  to crackdown on hacking
So many bug i hope rockstar can fixed
nostalgic game
uyddfghjklkjhgfds
This game is a petri dish for toxic players Rockstar had a good idea behind the game but their developers let it evolve into a sess pool of modderscheaters Instead of fixing the backdoors and exploits or addressing the blatant issues the developersat mostban the players Then the banned players can simply buy another account for like 10 US and do it all over again The fact that modderscheaters can block your ingame reporting and get a notification that YOU tried to do so speaks for itself pathetic

This Game is Amazingly Good with mods in story mode  I REALLY RECOMMEND IT
highest replay value ever for a game  amazing
it is one of the best games i ever palyed you should buy this game
Where is story mode dlc  Glad  I never spent a cent on shark cards even though most of the vehicles require copius amounts of grinding which is why I stopped playing online Yet the story mode is good not perfect but good and memorable Just wish Rockstar put some effort in single player dlc rather than packaging it with gta online like the The Contract where you got to see Franklin and Lamar years in the future
They have deleted my account and now i can not log in I wasnt even modding just casual play but they fucked it up
It says i have 20 hrs but really 6 of them are me trying to get it to work It worked the first few days and then ive spent the past year just trying to get it to launch Ive tried every solution available including formatting my pc and reinstalling windows no help
Still great after all these years
only good to run RP servers on pc tbh
Rockstar launcher says my steam is linked to another social account and that I cant play without signing into rockstar launcher This alone deserves a negative review Cant play a game I paid for because of your  launcher

Hell no fucking trash I dont know who was in charge of UXUI design for this game but they are a MASSIVE FUCKING RETARD Like seriously they must share brain cells with a chimpanzee the UX in this game is so ass Why tf do I need to doubleclick every fucking button to confirm my selection Are these devs retarded like yes I clicked the fucking button just do the fucking thing why tf do I need to use the arrow keys to select different options why tf does it use a custom mouse pointer thats so fucking sluggish its gay WHY TF DID IT MAKE ME DO THE TRASH TUTORIAL BEFORE I COULD PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS AND IT DOESNT LET YOU QUIT THE TUTORIAL AFTER STARTING IT REALLY And fuck me every time I want to quit a mission I have to go through 3 layers of dialog boxes like nigga just let me quit the fucking mission already Controls are wack af like really Q is the default for hiding behind cover what kind of retarded shit is that Scroll opens up a goddamn wheel menu what the cock WalkingSprinting feels weird I dont know why but somehow they managed to fuck that up Driving is retarded I briefly hit the spacebar and my car goes flying off like some turd in the wind I could go on and on with all the retardisms in this game I ended up uninstalling it after an hour and a half before I could discover any more I just cant deal with its stupidity If I knew they would set the bar as low as hiring complete RETARDS for the UX design I wouldve taken the job myself and done a better job goddamn Hope whoever was UX lead for this game chokes on a walnut and the hats off to the product owner for allowing this shit to go through Enjoy my fucking 20 wasted you dumb hoes

"Gta V is an amazing game
Excellent game to play with friends or family

However   Since day one peoples are cheating and still do on every online server there are alot of those players that use scripts  hacking tools and they dont get banned  They use god mode They can spawn random explosions around the map teleporting into your car and out or teleporting you to places they never get banned or kicked off the game you can see them on every online session or a mission they will ruin your missions and fun and cause you to get banned like they did to me and if you interrupt them in their stuff they just hackmod your character to get banned

So you can actually only play online in a closed session limited to so little content you can do but missions require most of the time 4 peoples so get your friends or dont enjoy any of that content or risk on getting banned

Its not that the game is stable it crashes every now and then to desktop when you try to do a mission or other activity than just roaming around doing the same things in the world 
So while going to lobby it pop you out of online mode sometimes you end in desktop for no reason so lets accuse the lobbies D but nope this is rockstar to be blamed for bad servicing 
Well logging in and out of sessions is taking like 24 min on a high speed broadband without using a proxy to improve connection issues like what the hell this is not a dial up service  and eventualy you sometimes get an error message that you cannot join your friend or the session cannot be found if you are lucky it just load forever  look at your screen for minutes and nothing happens okey lets try again lol

Well im not sad Rockstar is banning legit players they already lost most of their playerbase
So im happy because they just save us a lot of time trying to play a broken game
Its hard to change bad habits of players and us the casual gamers  we are sick and tired of it

Lets least hope GTA 6 does it different Trailer in December

Rockstar im not blaming you but seriously after 10 years you could have made a change and done us players a better service and not this horrible mess 
Its a fact that theres hardly any mission running open on online sessions  all the spam messages coming in your HOME online service menu proves that YOU are the one that should be Frustrated and not US
So goodluck working on that and thanks for saving me time o see ya probably not because

"A True Masterpiece but Player Behavior Can Be a Challenge

Rating  55

Grand Theft Auto V is nothing short of a gaming masterpiece Rockstar has crafted an openworld experience like no other with a sprawling vibrant city to explore an engaging story to follow and endless opportunities for mayhem and adventure The attention to detail and the sheer scale of the game world are truly remarkable

However the only downside Ive encountered in my time with GTA V is the behavior of some players in the online mode While the game itself is a work of art the online community can sometimes be a bit challenging You might encounter griefers trolls or hackers from time to time which can be frustrating when youre trying to enjoy the game

That being said I dont think this issue should detract from the games overall rating Its more a reflection of the online gaming environment in general rather than a fault of GTA V itself Rockstar has implemented various measures to combat these issues and there are many fantastic players and communities within the game as well

If you can look past the occasional troublesome player and focus on the incredible content and experiences GTA V offers youre in for an unforgettable gaming journey Whether youre into the story mode or the vast online world GTA V has something for everyone Its a game that continues to stand the test of time and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an immersive actionpacked adventure"

Best game ever2023
awesome game
IT Grand Theft Auto what are you thinking about
unless youre willing to spend money on a mod menu from some undisclosed source this game is unplayable online If you just want it to fuck around in the story mode then I can maybe recommend it but it is PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY GTA ONLINE WITHOUT CHEATING every single lobby you will join will have at least 10 cheaters and probably more so good luck trying to do something like sell stocks from your businesses because youll probably get killed by some 15 year old with god mode or some schmuck on a flying bike absolute shit
GOOD

"Rating  55

Grand Theft Auto V GTA V is nothing short of a modern gaming masterpiece Released in 2013 it has continued to captivate players with its vast open world immersive storyline and an unprecedented level of detail that has set a benchmark for the industry

The most striking aspect of GTA V is its sprawling fictional city of Los Santos a stunning and meticulously crafted representation of a modern metropolis Its teeming with life from the busy streets to the serene countryside and youll find yourself getting lost in the sheer size and detail of the game world Whether its a leisurely drive along the scenic coast an adrenalinepumping chase through downtown or an unexpected encounter with the local wildlife in the wilderness every moment in Los Santos feels like an adventure

The games narrative is equally compelling with three distinct protagonists Michael Franklin and Trevor each offering a unique perspective and personality The storytelling is topnotch weaving a tale of crime betrayal and redemption and it keeps you engaged from start to finish The characters are welldeveloped and the voice acting is superb enhancing the overall experience

GTA Vs gameplay is a testament to Rockstars commitment to excellence It seamlessly blends action exploration and driving mechanics offering a wide variety of activities from heists to tennis matches ensuring theres always something to do The games gunplay and driving mechanics are polished and satisfying providing an enjoyable experience for both casual and hardcore gamers

Moreover GTA Online the multiplayer component of the game extends the fun beyond the singleplayer campaign It allows you to explore Los Santos with friends engage in various missions or simply create chaos in the sandbox environment The constant updates and additions have kept the online community engaged for years

Graphically GTA V was groundbreaking when it first came out and it still holds up well today The attention to detail in the world design character models and vehicle physics is outstanding With the option to play in firstperson view you can immerse yourself even further into the world of Los Santos

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a timeless classic in the world of gaming Its a game thats not just about entertainment its an experience Even years after its release it continues to attract new players and retains a dedicated fan base If you havent experienced the magic of Los Santos and the engaging narrative of GTA V youre missing out on one of the most iconic and enjoyable gaming experiences of this generation Whether youre a seasoned gamer or new to the franchise GTA V is a mustplay title that will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on you"

"Grand Theft Auto Where Mayhem Meets Satirical Brilliance

Introduction
Ah Grand Theft Auto GTA the virtual playground where chaos and satire hold hands skip down the street and then promptly steal a car This iconic video game series has been a source of endless entertainment and controversy offering players a morally questionable yet undeniably captivating sandbox to explore So lets take a joyride through the twisted streets of GTA and examine what makes it a modern gaming legend

Graphics
The graphics in GTA are so realistic that if you stare at the screen long enough youll start to wonder if you should pay rent for your ingame apartment From the meticulously detailed urban landscapes to the aweinspiring sunsets GTAs graphics are so beautiful that even Mother Nature would be a little envious Just dont be surprised if you end up admiring the virtual world more than your actual surroundings

Gameplay
GTAs gameplay is like a bizarre mix of a circus act and a Choose Your Own Adventure novel You can drive a tank through a shopping mall steal a jet or just cruise around listening to some funky radio tunes while evading the police The games openworld environment is a neverending amusement park where youre free to choose your own wild ride Its like Disney World except with more guns and fewer mouse ears

Storyline
While GTAs narrative isnt exactly Shakespearean in its depth its like a cheesy Bmovie script that you cant help but love You play as a character who is almost always morally ambiguous and youll find yourself embroiled in various criminal activities that would make even Tony Montana blush The plot twists are often about as subtle as a sledgehammer but they are so overthetop that you cant help but be entertained Its a bit like watching a soap opera but with more explosions and fewer evil twins

Characters
GTA has given us some of the most memorable characters in the gaming world From the lovable psychopath Trevor Phillips to the suave and stylish Nico Bellic youll encounter a cast of characters who are as diverse as they are entertaining The game excels at creating antiheroes you cant help but root for despite their many many flaws Its like a gathering of your weirdest wildest and most unhinged friends at a neverending house party

Satire
One of the defining features of GTA is its biting social commentary and satirical humor The ingame radio stations and commercials offer a hilarious exaggerated take on American culture politics and consumerism Its like a Saturday Night Live skit on steroids and youll find yourself laughing out loud at the absurdity of it all GTAs satire doesnt just poke fun at society it skewers it roasts it and serves it with a side of chaos

Conclusion
Grand Theft Auto is not just a game its a cultural phenomenon Its a virtual playground where you can unleash your inner anarchist all while poking fun at the absurdities of the real world Sure it may not be everyones cup of tea but if youre looking for an irreverent actionpacked and often hilarious gaming experience GTA is the ride youve been waiting for Just remember to leave your moral compass at the door and your inhibitions in the real world In GTA anything goes and thats precisely what makes it so outrageously addictively fun"

gta 6 trailer coming out in a month hype fr cyperpunk trash
"The cheating problem is completely out of hand to the point where I want a console just so I can play without someone ruining my game Its obvious Rockstar doesnt care about PC GTA at all because any amount of effort would be an improvement over the current state of this game Today I played for about 4 hours and got crashed or kicked on 14 different occasions including 2 different times when I was selling special cargo which resulted in almost 2 million GTA lost I wont bother contacting Rockstar support again for reimbursement or reporting as they are completely clueless as to what their job is and copypaste generic answers for every inquiry Ive had with them over the past 8 or so years of playing GTA The ingame report and votetokick system is completely useless because the troublemakers are ALWAYS cheating and they can just block reports and votekicks not that they work in the first place The ratio of cheaters to normal players has to be somewhere around 1 in 4 On top of all this the game very frequently refuses to load into Online the first second or maybe even third time and I get infinite black screens or loading screens so often that even if I wasnt getting messed with constantly Id still have to reload the entire game about once an hour

Now onto the intended gameplay experience

Earlier this year Rockstar removed almost 200 vehicles from the ingame catalogue under the guise of streamlining the shopping experience or some bullshit like that On nextgen console they added some sort of car club that you have to pay a monthly subscription for yes monthly to get ONE free car a month and the mere opportunity to purchase some of those vehicles they took away for socalled simplicity Of course that hasnt been added to PC because again Rockstar doesnt give a fuck about PC players so our only option is to either cheat which kind of ruins the game or pray that in the next few years the car we want will finally pop up on the podium of the Diamond Casino AND we can somehow win it or Simeons dealership will at some point have it in stock

Vehicle prices have also become outrageous After modifications I ended up paying almost 2 million dollars for some dogshit hatchback that doesnt even go fast in a straight line and doesnt turn without losing control Most of the good affordable cars in the game of course got removed with Rockstars cleansing efforts so unless youre willing to grind for hours upon hours for a single good car or cheat you need to pay real money

Shark cards are also priced the same as when they were released and still give you the same amount of GTA as when they were released which was way back in 2013 To put that in perspective if you want the Oppressor Mk2 youll need to shell out 100 for the bike alone This doesnt include the price of the Nightclub AND Terrorbyte truck the Terrorbyte vehicle workshop addon and the price of all the modifications to the bike that make it worth using

Solo grinding has become slightly easier over the past year or 2 especially with the addition to warehouse assistants that you pay to source things like cargo but its still a nightmare to make money solo especially when youre first starting out For things like special cargo and MC businesses if you dont sell your stock while you have less youll be forced to make multiple trips in different delivery vehicles while the other ones play sitting duck and ping themselves on the map for everyone to destroy Alternatively you can hire associates or MC members which sucks because as I said before a majority of players cheat and cheaters tend to entertain themselves with griefing Or youll hire someone that either leaves the session destroys your cargo on purpose or just doesnt help

In short my favorite game to absolutely fucking hate"

best multiplayer plus single player open world game ever 
Rockstar is a laughably bad publisher They have for some reason decided that PC isnt worth supporting and have made features that are only available to PS5 and Xbox Series XS Mainly the 4 million they give you at the start of the game and an explanation of all the newer content Dont play this on PC if you have a console It is far better there and isnt overrun with mod menus and DOSsing

"A great single player story  I prefer GTA4s story but not for lack of quality on GTA5  Three protagonists were a pretty risky gamble on Rockstars part but it has a distinct immersion advantage over previous entries  Trevor is right at home being the agent of chaos feels great to rack up the wanted level as him  Franklin embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of your typical early game and Michael acts as the unfulfilled haveitall where all GTA protagonists end up its a lot like a player picking up an old save with a bunch of money but no direction because most of the missions are done  I had never really noticed how disjointed the main char of a GTA game was depending on my mood  The heist structure took the best of the story missions of 4 and created fun variations of heists throughout  Also following a crew was a breath of fresh air in the franchise even if increw relationships were not always golden throughout the story  Weapons feel good and differentiate themselves from each other well  Gunplay is the best its been in the series  Driving has the needle eversoslightly dialed back towards arcadey from the weighty driving of GTA4 a good change IMO  Visuals have aged well  The layout size and diversity of San Andreas hasnt been matched in a game of this type since  Tone is wellbalanced between classic GTA absurdity while not taking you out of the story at hand  Moneymaking side content is hohum par for the course  I did enjoy the golf and tennis which was a pleasant surprise

I would not advise engaging meaningfully in online even if you typically enjoy multiplayer  It feels like it started as one big joke at the expense of paytowin modern gaming that became the most successful example of the same ever  Convenient outcome for Rockstar stockholders Im sure   Its a huge money sink and a quintessential griefers paradise  Dont pay for the privilege of being a puffer to some whale sermon"

"I tried to come back to GTA again in November 2023 Fresh character level 1 I played for a few hours At some point Im sitting in my car waiting for this magnificent game to put me in any job available Hacker spawns beside me Fools around for a mintue and then smashes a huge pile of action figures boosting my level from 5  70

Absoultely disgusting I dont even blame him because he is obviously a special ed kid who thinks he is giving a charity by dropping 200k and 70 levels in the process

Anyways I will just calmly say the same thing I said to Poopstar in my RDR2 review DIE YOU DISGUSTING INCAPABLE THIEVEING GOBLINS I WOULD RATHER CALL MY HOMIES AND PLAY IN A SANDBOX IN THE PARK THAN EVEN THINK OF WASTING MY TIME ON A BETA PRODUCT THAT EVEN you DONT CARE ABOUT"
a good game and i like it with mods very good
i like running over the highway thingys
doesnt work to log into launcher on steam deck  refunded since as of right now my pc wouldnt be able to run it
very good
Amazing
Always a problem not the story but the launcher
So stopped playing for a while and I guess rockstar would think it was funny or something to make my code non functional which was a jerk move so now I cant play this stupid game good job rockstar how much are you worth 8 BILLION DOLLARS and scamming your fans good on you 80 bucks btw 2 days of hard work down the drain
Story mode is very fun and is a good first GTA game for someone new to them online needs work with hackers and general progression
i got for 20 buck for premium

story gets boring after a while

Everything is ridiculously overpriced and game locks up on the regular Game has been out for ten plus years and you still cant get it right Rockstar If this is how GT6 is if its ever released you can count me out
Used to be a great game came back in 2023 to play some new online content hacker grabbed me from the casino to torture me within minutes of logging in not worth the effort to find private servers

y es
its a w game even better if u hack but i dont 
Game wants to crash any chance it wants to especially on GTA online if you want to do heist with friends then youll probably have 6 out of 10 times of the game not loading the heist on all accounts some accounts will load in but the host wont so instant reset or the assets on one account will not load and the heist will not be completed A lot of the updates the game has mostly limit the amount of money a player can acquire in regards with the Cayo Perico heist No bug fixes or adjustment with other heist to make players want to play everything else instead of doing the Cayo Perico heist which to date is the most efficient way to money in the game everything else like business and bunker assignments has to be build up months in advance make a fraction of what you make in this heist so  long story short i wouldntt want to recommend a game focused on making every update become more tedium then fun like it was years ago but then again its a ten year old game and it seems all games are going this cringe direction of making more money instead of delivering a genuine fun experience to the consumer
My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on gta v and it gets 150 likes and 50 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here

if you really want to play GTA5 buy it off the rockstar launcher rockstars company is run by a staff with the combined iq of a fucking boulder and theyll tell you you need a R activation code to play the game THEY WILL NOT SUPPLY YOU WITH THIS CODE I have been waiting 8 days for an email back just so i can play GTAO for christsakes In short buy this game off R launcher or when the game FORCIBLY INSTALLS R LAUNCHER to run you cant play"

the social club is the literal worst thing every couple months ill get the desire to play this game and it ends up blocking me because of the stupid social club not recognizing my email and password
this game will west your timebut this game is good for penganguranpengganguran
i rather shove steamy hot metal balls in my urethra than playing online youre putting your personal data and your whole pc at risk for what just to get killed by some dude with fetal alcohol syndrome with zero skill but its able to blow you up with a pistol cause he rubbed the nipples of another 3rd world country unloved child for some cheats for a game that makes Rockstar millions they are more useless than Mojang developers when it comes to keeping their game playable fuck this game im gonna jack off

GTAV is not free and if you wanted to know its about 100 GB because the map is ginormous you can go in private sessions and do singleplayer and multiplayer also the game is about idk 56 dollars
I am the problem I have bought this game three times on three platforms I am delaying GTA VI and my sorrow knows no bounds But a game I buy three times is pretty fun so I guess that speaks for itself
i fucked my game lmao
Game is good

Gta is Brutallll now borderline unplayable with the amount of modders in the lobbys theres literally atleast one griefing modder in a lobby unless its a ghosttown its gone in the exact same direction as the 360 version of the game allz i wanna do is drive undisturbed and have communial interactions but its just an all out warzone with everybody on edge edit uninstalled it today im done getting on to drive and people messing with my time constantly ill play some other game where they care about their players its honestly disgusting the state the game is in and they are tryin to hype up 6 like it wont end up with the same exact problems unless they fix it it aint really hard for rockstar to demod gta
Its an addiction
i like it lot of things to do
You forget a thousand things every day pal Make sure this game isnt one of them
never thought Id appreciate this game as much as i do now in 2023 Yea the grind is one of the worst but the campaign is not a 410 3

play on laptop relatviely low graphics its non gaming works well enough 60 fps"
Very fun
Great game overall
"Kind of fun playing single player but online is run by cheaters who teleport onto you with godmode and just 1 shot you   This game is like 10 years old so at this point its a game feature not a bug  Unfortunately all DLC is for gta online only and not usable in story mode  This optimizes the amount of money they can milk off you

The story mode is easily worth the 20 it cost but I wouldnt pay much more than that"

I have played this game since 2013 from xbox 360 to xbox one to PC overall I enjoy the game at least enough to play it for 10 years cant say that with many games the one big downside is GTA Online I play online regularly on console but PC it is almost impossible to have a normal game without a modder coming and ruining everything overall I would highly recommend the story mode of this game but if you want to play online avoid the PC version and play the online mode on console otherwise you will have people with small pps trying to over compensate with their mod menus
i love but for goodness sake release gta 6 already
it works good on pc

WAS A great game but whats the point of paying for Shark Cash when every server has people cheating so much you cant do anything unless your on a server alone You can report cheaters all day Rockstar doesnt care single player is fun but everything online has become nothing more then a cash grab

Simply put The BEST video game ever made in my opinion Hours and hours of adventures and hell raising fun This should be a must have game for all The only video game that I feel that I have received above and beyond what I paid for
this is best game ever i liked
The game world itself is fun Its very entertaining to just drive around and shoot stuff and get into chases and crash frequently you know just regular old open world fun The story itself is full of edgy adult content that doesnt really do anything enjoyable And online is well its just not that great Hackers and MTX abound the game doesnt respect your time and the networking is godawful I mean you want to fire it up and play a bit and it will make you wait for five entire minutes just to load into a server Once youre on its mostly serviceable I dont think its worth your time investment And heaven help you if you need anything from Rockstar Support perhaps the most useless people in the whole industry Theres also a launcher and it sucks

"Gta V Online which is the part of GTA that you would come back to after being bored of singleplayer is trash
You either do jobs in a lone or coop setting which is boring or get blasted by a flying bike by someone who paid 50 dollars for it GJ Rockstar you made all your additions to multiplayer totally unnecessary"
very goood
it is not bad
once you play GTA V youll never leave the house 
NICE GAME
Very good I played it on xbox for like over 45 years just in story mode and I didnt get bored Now I bought a PC and wanted to play RP but I have a problem with fivem so I cant play RP My friends bought it and now we play online togather Even they have more levels bc of grinding I am the one who is a veteran know the mapshortcuts and many more I really recommend it
This game is so cool and have very realistic graphics
gdggghdfcdytcfdytgvgthyjd
sucks because they dont do anything to the hackers that sit there and grief lobbies to unplayable levels or how they can just push everyone from servers at once is pretty cool too not to mention trying to get into server in general is a full time job

Great game of the century
Great concept terrible execution and exploitation of consumer Ive had the game for I dont know a year or so Ive only been able to play it 50 of the time due to bugs and really long load times Support really evasive Onesided value system that benefits the company at the expense of consumer For example whatever the ingame currency is people pay real money for that so in situations where a bug or crashed server cost you ingame money one just loses that unless theyre willing to submit to the evasive support program each time However they are suspending banning and etc to yes customers for exploiting the third party modmenus that may reward ingame money  Lets just look at the subject of modders I think its safe to say all modders arent alike On one hand you have the griever who goes around heckling any and everybody On the other hand you have the modder who became a modder to defend against the griever lastly  the modder who only wants to experience his purchase in a reimagined way thats not dictated by the games producer At any rate the producer should be concerned with what the consumer demand is not with a strict dictatorship of what they wanted the experience to be like Lets keep it real Software companies think total emersion is key when in fact it isnt All that is needed is just enough realism to fool the surface senses and then the fantasy For example Most people lives suck They dont play video games to remind them how much their lives suck they play to escape Each time Rockstar releases a version of GTA the public responds with they think the product should be instead of what is presented modmenus Instead of Rockstar taking it as constructive criticism they look at it almost as if you stole or destroyed something Remember modders are consumers too and might arguably constitute the majority of Rockstars clientele base At the end of the day its not what you do but how you do it Recently my GTA V account was suspended and online character reset with no explanation To treat a customer in such a way was shocking so me knowing such companies live and die off the constant reinvestment of consumers Im just bidding my time waiting for the release of CTA 6 and Ill pass Ill pass on anything Rockstar One for their hubris Two for the disrespect of the money I invested into the company in comparison to what was gain in actual game play and time And Im sure Im not the only one I know this was written very poorly but its early Im annoyed and really didnt want to have to write this in the first place so please forgive my poor grammar

"Modders and grieffers have destroyed this game and made it unplayable

You spend days grinding to buy something you upgrade it the way you want it spending nearly 2million You take your new vehicle out to drive and some modder changes everything about your vehicle then blows you up for 2 hours straight for complaining then call you ungrateful

This game use to be awesome but modders and grieffers ruined it Oh and Rockstar you better get on to fixing this or no one will be interested in GTA 6 if this shit will be allowed to continue As it is I want my money back for GTA V"

its fine for the story mode but other than that its shit because there is absolutly no attention to detail and theres nothin to do like if you want to play online theres always a hacker or sweat thats spawn killing you and the only thing to do in online is make gta money THATS IT  plus on story mode still same thing nothing else to do other than the story and this game never and i mean NEVER gets actual updates they only ever change the whether in online mode and some items get a different skin never fixing and glitches or banning hackers no just pay to win usless crap dont get it its fun at first but then it gets boring as shit and the AI is dumber then a deep fried hamburger dipped in sweet and sour sauce

"Only leaving a negative review because all the online updates have bloated the install to over 109 GB at the time of this writing Thats absolutely insane I just wanted to reinstall to revisit an OLD game for a little single player goofing around Didnt this used to be like a 17 GB install back in the day I dont care at all about GTAO Cant that be separated into a different install 

Rockstar youve been milking this old game for over a decade now Give it a rest and give us a classic GTAV install to use if we just want to play single player Make GTAO its own thing And where is GTA6 already"
Hands down still one of my favorite games Easily
nicer game

I like how owerpowerd you can get if you play like as long as possible
Good game with good graphics

everting is fun add me
really good
veri gud
cool
its alright so far havent played enough to decide for sure
I thought it was cool but today I was suspended from Online for no reason AND my character is erased I cant do anything about it so in my opinion its not worth it because you can lose all your progress and cant even write to them
Its a great game dont get me wrong but it gets somewhat repetetive if you singleplayer you should play gta with more friends or something the story for single is good and if you finished it there is only left then gta online and its filled with hackers or bugs i just think you should play gta 5 only with friends honestly
like it
this game is one of the best games i played

"gta v has been one of my og games that made me addicted to gaming dont just play gta v online ok u have to play the storymode as it is one of the best storydriven games i have ever played and would def play the game again gta v online is pretty cool too but nothing beats storymode if u have no clue what it is about cos gta v online has some cool gta v easter eggs and even gta iv easter eggs and its pretty cool once u get the reference srsly play storymode

in terms of actually loading in the game there were times id get dced a bunch of times in online but what can u say what do u expect from a pc game lol better try playing this on ur console if u have one cos its much better for sure and so u can play it nonstop "
this is the best game thx steam for let me donwload this Legendary Game
purchased the game got a prostitute got a private dance in a strip club killed a man robbed a store then the games loading screen was finished and did it all over again10 10 would do again
Dont get me wrong the game itself can be fun I have a good number of hours into it over the years The single player was also quite good Truthfully there are quite a few reasons to recommend or buy this game if you never have but given the company behind it and the way they treat their patrons and players handle their business communicate things etc I just cant recommend anyone support this I firmly believe that we vote with our wallets and the only way to really impact the bottom line of these greedy corporations is to not buy the shit they are selling if we dont like it Thats how we make them wake up and thats how we get the changes we want At the time of release we didnt know what we know now The game is what nearly a decade old at this point No new game no real new content just rehashed things for online Egregious actions such as removing items from the game that people paid for and removing the anticheat system to prevent it from being a cesspool in public online lobbies These are just core things that you should not do and yet they do them The price of things use to be somewhat reasonable it was a nice balance of grind vs reward upon launch Now everything is so overpriced its not worth it to grind for and this was done solely with the malicious intentions to force players to buy shark cards for real money to acquire in game items The only thing we are missing at this point is a battle pass then we really will be at the peak of modern games Anyway if you already own this game by all means enjoy it I implore you not to buy their shark cards and if you dont already own this game just pass on this Save your money or take it elsewhere preferably to a companydeveloper that doesnt choose to do the most despicable things at every turn
I like this game so much that ii buyed new computer just for gta
just buy the damn game and stop looking at the comments
best online game ever

There is only one thing that i would love if Rockstar made hunting possible and selling meat of animals for dollars and i know T can do hunting but I would like to play free play like taxi driver that would be awesome to do in game Although i would not do that in real life though just to be clear i am a gta fan also waiting for gta 6

Online play is absolute garbage Playing this online puts you at risk for getting dossed CONSTANTLY among other MAJOR security risks Modders make the game unplayable Harassment is a huge issue and the general population of the game seems to consist entirely of psychopathic teenagers and lowlife human beings The only purpose that this game serves in a useful capacity would be for the FBI to build profiles on the mentally unstable people that play this and imprison them before they hurt someone or themselves
un juego con mas de 10 años que es mejor que los nuevos

Very good game with lots of cool mechanics and features pretty good graphics compared to previous gta games The story is really good and fun with good characters but rockstar needs to make this game cross platform in online mode and same with gta 6 when it comes out However do not buy shark cards they are not worth it i love starting illegal businesses in gta of course
ok yes this is bussin
you can blow people up
5th time buying this goddamn game
killing ppl
This game is Pretty decent but when it comes to the shooting system or glitches it is either full of them or just trash system If you dont have a problem with getting stuck in walls mid heists and die or just pure glitches of not being able to shoot while in a mission heist or mid fight or seeing the UI then sure go for it and try it
end
i like this game
Slow loading times lots of modders glitches and bugs slow grind for money it can be quite funentertaining at times or with friends but its just not a good overall experience
just like real life
its great BUTit have a lot of dark joke and bad things that i do not wanna talk about so it make the game unfunny and bornig
ye
get roasted in a mission for a terrible cut
good game 
too many hackers almost nothing in place to catch or reprimand them Rockstar does not care about their players just the money doubt VI will be any better

GTA V is an absolute masterpiece But Rockstar shouldve stuck to updating RDR2 GTA V brings nostalgia but it feels like you have o yeller on the stretcher hooked to IVs and wires to stay alive The mods for this game are amazing but theres so much trouble trying to keep them As long as theyre for story mod it should be fine I just wanna mod singleplayer Would buy again just to mod gta v singleplayer

this game is really good because of the cool cars and planes and detail
"Storymode Best 50hr Bmovie with unforgettable characters and blood pumping heists and more attention to detail than my parents ever gave me 

Online just enough content to keep you roaming Los Santos for 300 more hours with even better heists to do with friends the grind is real
truly one of the games of all time KIFLOM"

Social Club has the worst launcher and support ever
BEST GAME FOR EVER
"I dont recommend I recently tried to go onto GTA to find out Ive been permanently banned for literally no reason Never purchasing another Rockstar Product again

Literally have done nothing I only play storymode but I tried to go online for the first time and I just see permanently banned"
Its been 8 years since Ive been playing this game online and Rockstar hasnt been able to fix the goddamm online fucking 7 years old have access to mod menus that make them invincible rockstar doesnt punish players that play with cheats as long as you dont touch their sharkcards shame on you rockstar Im afraid to think what will happen to the online of GTA VI but Im sure that I wont be there because you dont deserve my time with this bullshit

BULLSHIT i just want to sit and play but the rockstar launcher keep having trouble and ask me to relogin reconfuse and stuff

gta 6 when

What can I say obviously one of the best
In my Opinion the 2nd best GTA game out there and my 3rd personal favorite gta game Map is very beautiful compared to GTA IV and has a lot more explorations and Easter Eggs Gunplay is very good however melee can get very boring and repetitive overtime compared to GTA IV and San Andreas that has multiple hand to handmelee combat I like how they handle the 3 protagonist swapping and their uses on the Story Missions Only Issue i can say about the game is its boring online gameplay and lastly wish it has new game plus where we can replay the story with all our moneystats
nice
i love this game

"I absolutely love this game Unfortunately due to the fact that its developers FORCE you to use their garbage piece of crap launcher I cannot recommend this game to anyone unless I tell them to just crack it Buy it on steam for all I care and then crack it but for your own sanity PLEASE DO NOT USE ROCKSTAR GAMES SOCIAL CLUB My account on the social club has been hacked 3 times and Im not the only one Many people have had this same issue and it seems that Rockstar could not be bothered about it They take 3 weeks minimum to fix the issue I have heard of people waiting months without a solution and then you just have to hope that nobody targets your account to hack into it Rockstar just sends you an email that says Your account email address has been updated Emails will now be sent to h38esfivesensesite instead That would be the account that the hacker used I would assume

Rockstar you suck 010"

Grand Theft Auto 5 one of my favourite games ever The best Grand Theft Auto game in my opinion Overall great game massive open world  fun and great multiplayer and an amazing experience Nextgen versions with first person mode switching and first person mode is so good if you prefer that way of playing and so many options and settings to change to give you the ultimate GTA V experience in first or third person This is just an absolute masterpiece the heists in online mode and story mode are so good Very highly recommend buying this game the best GTA in the series it will never get old Its just so good the story mode and everything I have nothing else to say its just the best

"if you like playing against others then online is worth

myself I dont like online and I do 100 games except this game is an absolute joke Online everything is extremely expensive so you will waste a lot of real life just to afford things after all this is how they want to manipulate and make you out of your free will use the codes called bank details and purchases the shark rip off add ons oh sorry since its legal rip off its called Marketing

so anyway because of the legal ripoff called marketing you will waste a lot of reallife hours playing this After all they did not introduce a lot of stuff in story mode and you can only ever play with many such vehicles in story mode if you use 3rd party programs of course this means a risk of ban on your account

so again if you want 100 avoid this game And if you want to play with some of the vehicles that are online exclusive well you sadly will not be able to unless of course you use 3rd party which is not allowed after all they are allowed to legally rip you off make you spend hours and hours and hours play this game to encourage you to use real money to access stuff but you using a 3rd party program is not allowed oh and did I already mention whoever makes the requirements for the achievements are trolls That persons most likely never did the achievements themself or have a gruge against people who love doing 100 Just look at the requirements including maps that show you collectables on a map just for an idea"

This game has the most infuriating MP of all the games Ive played throughout my life Full of cheaters which makes public lobbies unplayable If you lose connection you automatically get connected to SP where you must try to reconnect yourself because the game drops you and you should continue playing SP Does that even make sense Exactly Initial heist missions require you to have 13 people in your team which even at lv 100 ruin you games and youre forced to make THE SIMPLEST TASKS with 3 brainless players that shoot civilians instead of playing

ROCKSTAR GAMES SOCIAL CLUB     Not more to say
tthis game is best
I do recommend GTA 5 tho a few have been using mods online aka God Mode so getting into a poop server does occasionally happen 45 percent of the time IF ya cant level up to get the game done proper and have to use cheats to horn boost accel fine Dont make the game dumb for everyone else and port into peoples cars with settings to disallow passengers
one of the best games ever made
shoot kill and maybe get head by lester once or twice higly reccommend

"I dont know why I keep coming back to GTA every once in a while I think its the updates thinking maybe the game is better  Every time I play for multiple hours I just feel dead after playing  I think it all starts from wanting to go to the strip club have sex in a car and it turns into doing random things and shooting 

 Some of the multiplayer stunt missions have been absolutely hilarious fun but GTA does have a terrible way of setting up or gathering players for a game that ends up having everyone leaving

Remember when the game first came out and there is absolute huge hype  Ive already heard rumors of GTA 6 coming and literally youtube videos saying the rapture is going to happen when the game is out that its going to be super photo realistic and everyone is going to be playing the game  Jesus coming back to take us really all we want is peace and love  I need a relationship with Jesus and to go be with him in heaven one day I need to pray and read the bible  I just feel dead after playing and time wasted  At least after 8 hours constantly playing all day you can get closer to the end point of quitting than if you played casually for years"
boring af
its a game
It will enjoy it for quite a long time

loading screen gave me boner
if your account gets hacked good luck playing the game ever again D
Bom dmais
Paid for the game Own the game Cant play the game anymore because of the Rockstar launcher being needlessly baked in to the download and the mandatory social club account requirement locking me out because I previously made an account that I can not log into An account I know the username for an account I know the password for an account I know full well I registered under my main email address I can even find the old verification emails proving this yet the cockstar launcher claims that the social club account linked to my Steam account uses an email address I have no memory of ever using and it doesnt help that most of this email address is censored in the we couldnt log you in automatically prompt Not going to bother chasing up cockstar support for this gonna attempt to get a refund and regardless of how that goes I will not pay for another cockstar game again

"The game itself Great its GTA what did you expect However I cant even play it anymore

I bought this game waaay back but never had the time to complete it Now that I finally could I installed it and tried to log back into my old Rockstar account only to discover that it got broken into and even email changed without any notification on my old email address Now I cant log in cant play and cant even register a new account as this email address which Ive never seen is now locked onto my steam account Great job Rockstar make your own useless launcher and than dont protect it properly from hackers Its a joke youre a joke

I opened a customer support ticket but Ill be sure not to buy anything from Rockstar ever again Great job protecting our accounts and data"

very good game
i brutally kill my friends when they dont blow up the strip club with me
gg
that raning theme is very irretating me
good game
"GTA Online is very fun if you have friends The grinding in this game is on one hand very satisfying because you see some progress made if you choose the right businesses But on the other hand it can be very boring and frustrating if you get the same missions on a row or do the same business multiple times

The missions and rewards overall became better from update to update New content is being released regularly While some of these updates are quite horrible why tf do you remove most of the cars from the sites where you can buy them most of them give you a few hours of fun Replayability is not guaranteed though

Thumbs up because its fun"

nice

One of the Best Game I ever Played in Life
i have a shtty gaming laptop i purchased it with the knowledge i need too much disk space i runned the game putted on the lowest grpahics setting possible and it fricking works every setting on low resolution on 1080x720 im running this game minumaly 50 fps to maximum 80 fps and im soooo happy that i can play gta nomrally  love this game
nice game
what a great game
Still a good game even after 10 years Just need to fix the servers
good
tooo many hackers in game
Great story
i love this game
best game i ever played
"This game really cannot be well described in a review but ill try my best


The SinglePlayer and Story are very good lots of activities quite a sizeable amount of overall variety interms of vehicles weapons businesses However for those coming from GTA IV this is a more light sided story rather than the grim from the GTA IV so dont expect another emotional ride about how war is horrible and it screws people over

This is more of a cynical reality of what USA is and wants to be dumb fun simply said


Now the Online sectionwhich is controversial for many

The Online pretty much is a whole seperate game and id treat it as a MMORPG Sandbox than a open world this is one of its biggest flaws and upsides For those that like to grind their games this is one of the best mixed genres if you ask me there is content suited for most likely anyone


Concluding this whole jumbomumbo buy it you will definitely get your value from this gameespecially on sale 14 euros"

Grand Theft Auto V is a highly engaging and immersive openworld game that offers an intense and exhilarating experience It boasts a vast and diverse world filled with activities and missions that keep players immersed for hours on end The games storyline is engaging and the characters are wellrealized allowing players to get emotionally invested in the games plot The graphics and sound are topnotch and the games mechanics are intuitive and fun to learn Despite some minor glitches and occasional frustrations Grand Theft Auto V remains a classic and highly recommended game
"este juego es el mejor te explicare porque es viejo lo jugaban todos y si lo jugaste en xbox 360 o ps3 ya sea en la de tu amigo primo o tuya o simplemente fuiste a unas maquinitas compralo este es un juego de los que si o si deberias tener tiene historia muy entretenida y para mi es el mejor juego que tengo ahorita D

very good game but the modders are annoying and fiveM is ass i get banned for every rp i go to
good game love
stuck in endless tutorial loop no fun at all Delete character and start again to skip tutorial at least puts an end to the introductory misery but would have preferred to not waste several hours going in circles to start with

its stupid as hell when you equip a knife or baseball bat and when youre about to swing your idiotic character decides to kick  remove that stupid mechanic  allow us to stab some npc to death AND ALSO when you swing your bat golf club wrench or whatever make it a higher swing  so its not at a low elevation hit i enjoy destroying cars and i hate when it swings at the same leveled area and not windows and stuff another stupid thing  when youre driving and whip out your gun  why the hell are you destroying the window for

"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME Hackers have the ability to crash your game and remove you from any lobby even if your playing solo Rockstar will not ban them and Steam will not give you a refund I have tried to complain to both and received a giant go Fk yourself in return Plus the entire community protects them and calls them modders not hackers
DO NOT BUY A GAME THAT OTHER PLAYERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TURN OFF YOUR GAME FROM THEIR COMPUTER
AVOID AT ALL COST"

Really good game Especially with friends There are alot of thing you can do such as Mission Tuning Cars Heists and just having fun I recommend this game for those people who like shooting and driving There may be some cheaters but you can report them I have played the game for almost 200 hours and it never gets boring to me
"Hello

"Overall a good game but i am really pissed of right know and i can fuck anyone from rockstar They are a million dollar game maker and they dont even care about players The game take to long to open and in the game it has to connect with the rockstar server for online playing And the launcher fail most of the time In the game when i am in a friends session it automatically kick all players and i had to complete my fucking mission again And i am not even talking about those fucking mission icons in online map They sucks everytime And the game is full with hackers and when my teammate drive in missions it seems the car is teleporting because of lag issues 

My pc spec is decent so dont tell me it is my pc problem

i am playing rp servers but on my ps4 i played gta and i got to say that if you did not play this game you can not have a complete live
Mostly Positive I didnt like the main story because I dont relate with psychopaths so I didnt finish it But there is enough to do in the online game for PVE with some friends in a closed session I generally avoided PVP since there are too many hackers that have ruined open sessions You can solo play most of the online game in a closed session and I tried that for a while but ultimately got bored quickly If you buy a military vehicle you generally cant use it in the heists except the setup missions but you can use them for cargo nightclub and motoclub The humor in newer updates such as drug wars has become more crassannoying and less tongueincheek They still havent fixed the slow player controls after all these years The only reason I have so many hours in the game is because there was a time when I could go AFK while the nightclub accumulated but they changed that I recommend buying this on sale if youre looking for something different to play but dont expect too much Once you get to the endgame theres nothing to do other than collect expensive useless vehicles Dont hesitate to move on to a different game at that point
Best game of all time
very entertaining

I love this game

"Ah Grand Theft Auto V the game that proves crime can be a family affair From the moment I first stepped into Los Santos I knew I was in for one wild ride You see this game has it all  action mayhem and a touch of good ol family drama

The city itself is stunning and its like a virtual playground for chaos I mean Ive stolen planes jumped out of helicopters and even robbed a few stores with my pals Franklin and Trevor Its like a neverending vacation except with more gunfights and fewer piña coladas

Franklin is the man when it comes to driving Hes got a need for speed thats just as crazy as mine but with fewer traffic accidents Trevor on the other hand is well lets just say hes a unique character Hes the kind of guy you dont want to cross but hes also the kind of guy you cant help but laugh at His explosive personality matches the explosive action in the game

And dont get me started on the missions From heists to drug deals gone wrong its like a neverending rollercoaster of adrenaline Theres something truly satisfying about pulling off a perfectly executed heist and then escaping from the cops like a bunch of pros

But its not all about crime You can play tennis go for a round of golf or just chill out by the beach Los Santos is the perfect place for a getaway as long as you dont mind the occasional gang shootout or police chase

In a nutshell GTA V is like a Hollywood blockbuster that you get to star in So grab your virtual sunglasses hop in a stolen car and get ready for a wild ride Just remember crime doesnt payunless youre playing this game"

"Timi 
nerf oppressor mk2"
After 10 years I would expect security on online servers to be decent at least I almost got doxd today because people on GTA Online are malice This is by far the worst game I have ever played DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF YOU VALUE ANY TYPE OF CYBER SECURITY
"This game died early 2019 no one besides bots actually play this no one cares about spooky events on a 10 year game stop jerkinf eachother off and get gta 6 out alreadyRockstar games


finished all achievements still hate the game btw"
"Its a thumbs up

NB I dont touch online never will

Characters are great the story is nice enough the heists make the missions a bit more meaningful and connected the radio is interestingfunny and has some good atmospheric tracks the open world is really nicely done

I bought this game twice on Xbox but never finished it because first one disc got trashed then when I got a second my xbox was trashed So I picked this up in a sale on pc to finally finish it

The bad points
 The open world is great but often meaningless This was a criticism of mine for San Andreas albeit one of the greatest games of all time You can go somewhere and it looks nice but is there any purpose or meaning If you want to shoot beachgoers yes but not a lot else It reminded me of Fallout IV where you can build a base with a pool table but why when no one interact with you
 They really need to put manual gearchanges in to their next GTA I know lots of US vehicles are auto but the driving is boring in that there is no satisfaction of dropping a gear to get up a hill or overtake
 the speed is restrictedunrealistic watching the speedometer I think it goes up to 100mph for pretty much all cars really a Ferrari or whatever doing 100mph max You should be able to push it to 155 and be punished for doing so by wrapping yourself around a tree It makes driving half the game really quite timid
 Most missions are still just drive bangshootdrive crash drive finish
Look I know it is GTA but still the missions are quite repetitive and feel quite dumb in the great environment that there is
 Controls when walking are awkward I think this is much better in RDR2 hopefully it will be for any future GTA because the number of missions I messed up because the controls are clanky is huge I never finished GTA IV because the controls were clanky and I got sick of being called for dates to go bowling etc
 all the money houses businesses side games dont seem to matter as you can finish tthe story quite early After the first couple of missions I never went to an Ammunation again I tried to use the stock market but didnt have enough to invest then when I did it was pretty much the end of the game The golf and tennis is nice but after a while you think what is the point might as well get a golf or tennis game And I totally forgot until now there was hunting
 They spent WAY too much time on doing the whole strip club thing
 Collectables were a bit meh the whole underwater thing way too time consuming compared to tagging in San Andreas which was fun

So many criticisms yet still a thumbs up

Because if you play through the story just have a laugh it is great fun and recommended and ultimately I am glad I played it I think years ago the side elements of GTA were as good as even full games but now GTA feels a bit of a jack of all trades master of none refining the driving and nicely fluid footcombat controls in future might help

Love the characters though just wish there had been twice the story"

"Online is dead 
Speaking from a strictly online perspective there is no reason to play the game Those with paid mod menus have eclipsed any level of cheat detection and are in every public lobby you join Its boring to try and do missions when you just get killed by immortals so you get a mod menu and then what Youre just being shot at for no reason while shooting back for no reason This is advanced warfare If GTA 6 has the same problem I dont want one joke about capitalism in it in GTA 6"

"Single player is ok standard GTA story of steal cars and murder prostitutes etc

Online has huge potential if you enjoy moddershackers Who are most likely virgins living in their mothers basement killing you without any form of reason or sporting chance then youll really enjoy this out of control game

GTA online is clearly set in a freeforall wartorn version of the US where nobody cares about anything other then money A bit like Rockstar themselves This is possibly where the inspiration came from as the game developers dont seem to care about anything as long as the game continues to make them money Who cares if people mod scam or cheat it doesnt matter its profitable

If all that sounds like a good time then this is the game for you"

THE GAME
hm
its ok
one the best masterpiece by rockstar
This game is a timeless gem that sets the bar high for openworld gaming Its complete and unique world diverse characters and engaging narrative make it an unparalleled experience From the bustling streets of Los Santos to the stunning landscapes of Blaine County the games immersion is unmatched The ability to switch between protagonists adds depth humor and satire to the storytelling GTA Onlines endless activities and heists provide countless hours of fun but the only drawback is the persistent issue of hackers Despite this GTA 5 remains a mustplay a game that no other in its genre has yet to surpass

The story mode is good but the online mode is a superficial rigid waste of time in comparison its just about grinding and making money not so much about having fun it seems I would have enjoyed a decent story DLC much more and would have paid for it The physics and some other details are less realistic than GTA IV but the pc port works much better

Only issue with this game is the prices on some things dont add up for example 600k for a railgun okay thats reasonable 400k for a gatling laser gun okay thats strange 400k for a laser rifle its nearly the same price as the gun that has one weakness the position you hold it that means you cant go in cover

"A heavily pregnant Rarity modeling some maternity outfits for OlderSpike in a private little fashion show Rarity is pregnant with septuplets and shes showing off her tenmonthpregnant body for Spike who is the father Spike is looking on with great interest leaning back and leisurely jerking off while he enjoys the show Before he can cum Rarity climbs down and mounts him cowgirl letting him orgasm inside her Spike has a ridged dick with a tapered point along with a thick bulbous knot at the end Rarity is modeling a navy and violet dress with a silver hemRarity is pregnant again this time with twelve foals The compatibility and fertility of dragons and ponies is no longer in question and the effects of which have been having an interesting effect on Raritys body Dragon magic has started to intermingle with her own bonding her to Spike and allowing him to be of equal size to mate with him no matter how big he grows Which is good because Spike has started growing more and more as days past the power of the Elements starting to affect him as well Now with both of them growing larger by the day with no sign of stopping they have one last romp on their old bed before they both outgrow itA few years have passed Rarity and Spike have continued to grow bigger and stronger continuing to have more children as the Elements of Harmony infuse them with divine power Here Rarity is once more ten months pregnant with more foals than ever but even as a giant in a state of advanced hyper pregnancy she still like to go hunting for gems Spike still helps with her gem hunting endeavors mostly to make sure shes safe but also as a bonding activity
 
However being alone in such a beautiful and nostalgic place often leads to them feeling frisky although considering their sex drives these days theyre pretty much always friskyIt was now clear destiny had something in mind for Spike and Rarity The combination of the Elements and ancient dragon magic couldnt be blamed for their continually growing magic size and fecundity Even their consciousnesses had begun to expand to new and greater heights leaving many to speculate they were ascending into gods Spike and Rarity didnt know themselves but the new abilities they discovered and demonstrated allowed them to not only provide for their growing family but expand it even more
 
Here Rarity is implementing a new form of magic allowing her to be impregnated while already pregnant In moments her packedfull womb will be swelling even bigger with freshlyconceived lives all rapidly gestating to catch up with their older siblings Spikes orgasms are copious but she wont be wasting a drop of his thick virile seedits all going inside for maximum results
 
Spike whod intended to watch the process can hardly contain himself He can sense the spell working and is now about two seconds from plunging back inside Rarity and knocking her up even more His massive nuts are filled to the brim and aching his cock is harder than ever and he fully intends to knot her and pump her full first doubling the baby count then quadrupling then octuplingSpike and Rarity now ascended into gods are in the midst of creating new planets to raise their evergrowing family Spike does the heavy lifting of the process meaning the creation of the planet core and mantle the planets crust and mountain ranges the oceans etc Dragon magic is primal and more closely attuned to the building blocks of reality so this task is easier for him Once hes done Rarity comes in and does the finer details such as the atmosphere and weather the flora and ecosystems and more
Rarity cant help but admire Spike as he works He certainly does make for an impressive and powerful figure and he only becomes more so with time Perhaps Spike doesnt realize hes accidentally putting on a show for her but then again perhaps he does It certainly wouldnt be the first time theyd shown off to each other like when Rarity had shown him a new maternity dress oh so very long ago As a dragon god Spike is rather proud of his achievements and knows Rarity loves him with all her heart He definitely intends to keep her close to his side for the rest of eternity immortalizing her within his very domain because of the children they created

About ten years have passed since theyve created the universe Both Spike and Rarity have had their fair share of friskiness impregnating more magical beings while their magic ages them even more Spike is usually impregnated while wearing a more elaborate outfit such as his extremely long leather skirt and hot pink pussycat sweater combo Rarity still enjoys using sex as a way to infuse more magical life into her body which is clearly evident when Spikes enormous thick giant cock thrusts inside her while she wears her light brown frilly robe For these ten years Spikes sex life has been nonstop with his lust for Rarity never having been quenchedor at least the lust was somewhat used up until now

Its been months since Spikes semen made its way into Raritys womb but the magic is still able to grow new baby flesh in both of their wombs The two of them are still quite young only three or four years on the grand scale so the magic of children is not necessary But the magical still allows Spikes enormous cock to expand and grow more fully and once again Spikes teeth and beard are not long enough to enclose his mouth and give him full control of his breathing Rarity though has grown into an even more beautiful and charming woman Her hair is more lustrous than ever and has been magically tamed so it follows her dancing on top of her head in an endlessly fascinating pattern each lock shimmering like diamond dust Raritys eyes are still silver and sharp although theyre a little more round than they used to be Shes gained a few less pigtails over the years as well

Spike is still in a lustful permanent manlust state since Raritys womb produces impregnable offspring

I may have depression and many other diseases But I got to level 1K
fantastic open world game 
slip inside the eye of your mind dont you know you might find a better place to play
Following recent updates and poor management of content I will no longer be playing this game if it was even possible to refund the game at this stage I would dont buy this game now it has everything it used to and even less after they removed vehicles from the shops and changed the grind of the game to be more painful than actually time consuming in every money making strategy there is that one mission that might come up that wastes time and is difficult to complete in addition to being very buggy Id recommend going elsewhere to play around with cars and shoot cops other games do it better
game is fun i love franklin hes black

i got a smol pp and when i wach this i becom the rock
very adicting
talking about online played 144 hours and its a really fun game but the only thing to do when you have everything is just to get mods or grief so i recommend it for your spare time as its a pretty long game and story mode is good too but online is just better in my opinion but overall loved it
i would differently recommend this game its awesome
All time best game for me
sheesh
"So the story mode in this game Its a real joy You can just cruise around have fun and get lost in the game world But lets talk about the online mode where things take a frustrating turn due to those pesky modders

Trying to get a simple Heist prep done becomes an ordeal when modders are lurking around They can blow you up or take you out as soon as youre about to reach your destination It feels like theyre everywhere on almost every server Even if you try to report them its often futile because they can crash your game and erase any trace of your report from Rockstars system leaving them scotfree

These modders arent just satisfied with ruining gameplay they also spam the ingame chat with ads making it beyond annoying Whats worse their activities can make the servers lag due to the sheer volume of their antics Today I ran into a modder who at first seemed like a savior by freeing me from a submarine another modder had trapped me in But then they turned the tables by making my character noclip sending me soaring into the sky and then plummeting me to my death They also teleported me away from my destination just when I was about to reach it All in all the online experience on these servers is nothing short of a disaster

To sum it up while the story mode is all fun and games the online mode is marred by these modders who take the fun out of it and create a pretty frustrating environment for players"

Niiiiiiiice 
Great story and the heist are actually pretty fun and the game and you have a lot of freedom highly recommend it
"An actual amazing game lying beneath a thick coat of broken gameplay and horrible updates  This game is like the most abusive partner you could ever have  And though i still have an unexplainable fondness of the game I seriously cant stomach how unplayable every session has become Plagued with the same issues repeating themselves everytime you load up the game From the horribly laced servers terrible game stabilitycrashes Horrible frameratepeformance drops Graphical Glitches and last but not least getting stuck in a fucking loading screen And even if you manage to fight through all that with you sanity left Then comes the Recycled contentRemoval Of Beloved Content Uninspiring Updates Constant Phone Calls and last but not least modders

I really love this game But it definetly has much to come back for and so much enjoyability But with all the issues stated above its simply impossibly for me to have fun playing this game I just feel iritated

 I recommend you buy this game because it is with no do doubt a classic and the story mode is phenomenal and actually pretty replayable imo But beaware of the journey of Love and Rage ahead of you"

this game has boobies
We do quite a considerable amount of mental trickery and mockery of those who are unfortunate enough to fall victim to our clever little trap of social teasing laughs in upper class

Single player is great as long as you dont get hacked and your ip address revealed on the internet Multiplayer is absolute trash on pc with nothing but modders Suffer from a glitch Support is a joke ROCKSTAR DOESNT TAKE CARE OF ITS GAMES They dont care about you they dont care about the modders all they want is for you to buy shark cards like the good little consumer you are

"HEY I KNOW YOUR KINDA HUNGRY BUT DO I GOT A GOOD TAMALES GUIDE FOR YOU 
step by step so you cant miss it

INGREDIENTS
FOR THE FILLING
1 pound boneless pork shoulder
12 large white onion
2 cloves garlic divided
1 bay leaf
1 pound tomatillos
4 serrano peppers
1 tablespoon canola oil
1 tablespoon kosher salt plus more for seasoning
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon Mexican oregano
12 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper plus more for seasoning

FOR THE DOUGH
1 large package dried corn husks about 1 pound
2 pounds fresh masa for tamales purchased from a tortillería not masa preparada or 3 cups masa harina for tamales
12 to 3 cups salted chicken broth not lowsodium
1 14 cups canola oil
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 12 teaspoons baking powder

EQUIPMENT
Steamer pot
Large pot or bowl
Medium saucepan
Stand mixer or electric hand mixer
Tongs
Blender
Strainer
Slotted spoon
Chefs knife or paring knife and cutting board
Measuring cups and spoons

INSTRUCTIONS
STEP 1 Soak the corn husks Place 1 package corn husks in a large pot or bowl and add enough hot tap water to cover Make sure the husks are submerged by weighing them down with a few coffee mugs

STEP 2 Cook the pork Cut 1 pound pork shoulder into 2inch chunks Season with kosher salt and black pepper Place in a large saucepan Cut 12 large white onion into 2 pieces and add 1 piece to the pan Add 1 of the garlic cloves 1 bay leaf and 2 12 cups water Bring to a simmer over high heat about 7 minutes Reduce the heat to low cover and cook until the pork is fork tender and falling apart stirring every 20 minutes to prevent the bottom of the pot from burning 1 to 1 12 hours total Meanwhile start the chile sauce

STEP 3 Cook the chile sauce ingredients Husk and rinse 1 pound tomatillos Place in a medium saucepan Add the remaining onion piece remaining garlic clove and 4 serrano peppers and cover with 1 inch of cold water Bring to a boil then lower the heat to medium Simmer stirring occasionally until the items have softened about 8 minutes for the tomatillos and peppers and 12 minutes for the onion and garlic Use a slotted spoon to transfer the items to a bowl as they are ready Let cool slightly then coarsely chop the peppers discarding any tough stems onion and garlic

STEP 4 Cool the meat When the pork is ready use a slotted spoon and transfer it to a bowl Remove 14 cup of the broth for the sauce Let the pork cool slightly then shred with your fingers or two forks

STEP 5 Blend the sauce Place the tomatillos chopped chiles onion garlic and 14 cup broth in a blender and blend until smooth

STEP 6 Combine the sauce and meat Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a medium saucepan over high heat until shimmering Add the sauce in one quick pour Stir in the shredded pork Add 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano and 12 teaspoon black pepper Bring to a boil and cook for 3 to 4 minutes to let the flavors meld The filling should taste saltyit needs to be saltier than youd think to stand out inside the tamales Remove from the heat and set aside

STEP 7 Knead the dough If using masa harina for your dough place 3 cups masa harina in a deep mixing bowl and pour in 2 14 cups chicken broth Mix with your hands until the dough is moist and soft If using fresh masa knead 12 cup chicken broth into 2 pounds masa with your hands until a firm dough forms

STEP 8 Mix the dough Pour 1 14 cups canola oil into a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment Alternatively use an electric hand mixer and large bowl With the mixer on low speed  and dont wear your best clothing because it will splatter  add the masa in golfballsized pieces one at a time The dough may look rather lumpy and unattractive here but it will eventually transform Stop the mixer and sprinkle in 2 teaspoons kosher salt and 1 12 teaspoons baking powder If using masa harina stir in an extra 12 cup chicken broth Mix on high speed until the dough is very light and fluffy about 10 minutes more

STEP 9 Spread the dough inside the husks Remove 1 corn husk from the water and wipe off any extra water with a towel Use a rubber spatula to spread about 14 to 12 cup of dough the amount depends on the size of the corn husk in a large rectangle Leave a few inches of space at the top so the dough doesnt burst out once its cooking and leave about 3 inches of space at the narrower end of the leaf so you have room to fold it

STEP 10 Add the homemade filling Add a small amount of the pork filling about 2 tablespoons in a line down the center of the tamal Dont add too much or else it will spill out of the husk when youre folding it

STEP 11 Fold the tamales closed To close the tamale bring one side of the tamal toward the other like an empanada or a taco and press lightly to seal Then tuck the leaves of the husk over each other into a tubeshape Press down on the narrower end to seal then fold up toward the wider end Set aside folded side down and repeat with the remaining tamales

STEP 12 Steam the tamales for 35 minutes Add water to a steamer pot and line the insert with a layer of corn husks This helps keep the steam trapped inside and adds a bit of flavor Bring the water to a light boil Place the tamales vertically openside up in the steamer but dont pack them too tightly or they wont have room to expand Cover with some extra corn husks Cover and steam until the corn husk easily pulls away from the tamal about 35 minutes

STEP 13 Let the tamales cool 10 to 15 minutes Dont eat the tamales immediately after you remove them from the pot as theyll be too soft still Let the tamales cool for 10 to 15 minutes  theyll firm up quite a bit and be ready to eat

AND THERE YOU GO ENJOY"

"Great Story Great Gameplay Singleplayer is great
Multiplayer is cheatinfested and rockstar is moneyhungry so grinding money is ultra tedious to the point of not being fun feels like a mobile game playing online the cheaters dont make it any better this game is literally the biggest cheaterinfested game i played in my entire life not even counterstrike can compare

only giving this a YES because of the Singleplayer Campaign"
This game is good never played online but the story mode is amazing
Cant play the story mode offline on the steam deck

Amazing game truly worth the wait for the downloading time but trust me its too addictive
its all we have till GTA6 202425
This game is horrendous Owned since day one came back to replay after a couple of years only to find it now requires a launcher to be downloaded and my game key is no longer valid wtf rockstar you just expect people to pay for a new copy of the game nah go play literally any other game Rockstar has ruined their entire lineup of games and hopefully will be cast into oblivion by their own ineptitude very soon
very nice
fun game but its 18 dont give it to your kid if you have one

LOVE THE GAME  SMOOTH AF
Osm Game
creativity
i like gta
GTA 5 is brilliant i love it too bits and everything about the game is perfect almost you see even though i am leaving a positive review on this game due to how great it actually is there is an issue One single issue that makes the game a little worse than it can be The cop system in this game isnt great There is no real way of putting it but it really does kinda suck just a little bit in my opinion At the time of writing this i have roughly around 20 hours of game play and i think i can say with all honesty that the cops in this game are not the best it makes a game about committing crimes no longer really feel like it as you constantly have  to worry about the whole system I think the star system is great it makes sense and its easy to understand but just because of how the cops are in this game it makes it feel more like just an annoyance please dont take this as a dont buy this game kind of review the game is terrific and i really mean that its nearly perfect i just think the cops could be worked on a little bit and thinking about how a game based around crime can be so easily shadowed upon by the police system within the game Really do buy the game anyway It is outstanding just good it really is but be warned about how the police works in this game Its very different to say it lightly
Great game Been years of unyielding fun not recommended for anyone under 25 but definitely no one under 18 should be playing this very violent a ton of sex and drug references characters break pretty much every law you can think of short of hurting children as well as the most foul language in any game If youre looking for a way to live a virtual criminal double life free of any consequences this is the game for you
I love this game

Its GTA V This game speaks for itself Online is a love hate thing Its 2023 and they have made changes that really amplify money making and you can eliminate any and all threats from the toxic community by just having your own friend sessions where you can manage your businesses without issues To me thats been the biggest and best change made to this decade old masterpiece All Ive ever wanted was piece and quiet when doing my business missions Thanks to that change my empire cranks out money left and right
EEEEEEE
Gta online is a cesspool but aside from that the story is underrated asf Great replay value aswell

Online Modders No thank you
to be quite frank there is nothing grand about this game nor am i a THIEF if you play this game you need to REPENT how dare you steal from members of the general public really think about your actions when i am thinking about it it makes me sad because they will have no money and yeah i have money but like what do i do with all that cash i LIED I GO AND CRY INTO MY GAZILLIONS IDIOTS I WOULD NEVER CARE I AM GRAND ROTUND LARGE AT THEFT NOT VERY AUTO BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE A DRIVERS LICENSE BUT THAT IS OK MY FATHER WILL DRIVE ME 3

"A wonderful game full of endless things to do and its really hard to get bored if you keep an open mind I personally love the game modes Arena was one of the best updates to ever come out for a video game even if it was a massive investment with little return 

Unfortunately no amount of role playing or amazing updates could ever rid the modders no amount of vast cash cards could save us For modders they always win children can mod they dont die they have infinite money I dont see how they can play longer than 5 minutes and get bored but every lobby has at least one usually 5

The only saving hope is that the first 6 months of GTA6 will be clear of modders maybe it can feel like a real game again without being bombed into San Andres just for saying a modder had a flare up of tiny pp syndrome"
GTA V Online really brings out my blackness
FUN

lester take too much money from my heists
FUCKKING SUCKS

every time i log on my pc i have to get the internet to work for the game and this is the only game it happens to
COOL
This games story is top tear and amazing in general the grand theft auto V story is outstanding and deserves an oscar There is nothing bad i can say about this game its perfect and the best game i would recommend this game any time of the year
the same st for 10 years still can be both irritating and fun
best video game cant wait for GTA6

"I had a lot of fun initially until I realized that the only thing worth doing are the main missions The driving and combat feel great

The game is full of side activities that I didnt find worth doing after a while I miss the gang wars and dynamism that older games like GTA San Andreas had It kind of feels like theres nothing to do outside of the main story which is a shame considering the size and scope of the game Even when I bought new properties it kind of felt pointless and underwhelming They also seem to tease a heist system that I never could engage with outside of the main missions

The humor and tone is ridiculous and entertaining At least it has that going for it

Single player was great the characters were well thought out and the voice acting was spot on especially Trevor I still dont love the control system of the character but everything else is a nice experience Multiplayer is fun with friends or randoms I made a couple more gaming friends from this game and play other games with them The cheaters are around in this game but they cant do much with bought cheats and hackers you can report and get them banned but most of the time they arent a game ruining experience like Red Dead Online

"Amazing game I have it on my xbox 360 one  PC
Spent over 1000 hours in online mode only and single has 300 hours
 downvoting only because they recently added a new Rockstar Launcher which makes me unable to play the story game offline with no internet connection because it needs to verify that I bought the game that I am launching from STEAM
Makes this game unplayable on my steam deck because it is literally offline whenever I am on the go
This was not like this in the past we did not have this BS third party launcher"

one of the best games ever made

GTAV was a good game but Rockstar has done a terrible job with its online mode Each lobby you enter has hackers in it and the grind from when you start is terrible Besides all the hackers and the annoying grind I actually really like this game and think it is worth playing A lot of the heists and game modes manage to make the game quite enjoyable for me

"The base game its alright the story will take you around 20 hours to complete including all the side missions after that all you have left to do is busy work collect 50 of those collect 50 of that find 100 of these the game itself is replayable to a certain exten but the outcomes are not that different from each other

What gains it the negative review for me is the online part of the game every single little thing is designed to make you want to buy shark cards every part of the gameplay is walled behind millions of dollars that youll have to spend hundreds of hours gathering by playing the same mission 100 times or buying a shark card the public lobbies are a sshow the game has been abbandoned in that aspect the publisher and developers gave up on that a long time ago modders and account sellers rule the online aspect of the game the things that you can do by yourself are very limited and if you want to do all of it its virtually impossible because everyone is either out there godmode griefing low levels or running the same 2 missions over and over to save enough money to buy a specific car or whatever else"
The modders are EVERYWHERE and make the game impossible to play THEY GO UNPUNISHED There seems to be no anticheat whatsoever It cant be that hard to notice players teleporting and killing other players across the map
i play every day and night no touching grass
Very good game I liked it and definitely great to recommend to others

But the only downside is the hackers I logged in one day and this guy had put a boat a plane and a lot of random crap in my home garage I was annoyed at first But looking back on it it was pretty funny"

good graphic good story This game is definitely one of the best games i ever played
Broken mess with all the hackers that rockstar cant be arsed to ban or block from the game and the fact that the loyalty award for completing the heists with the same people is broken was supposed to get 26 mil in total got a big whopping 0 from it although the only money i got from the heist finale was from doing the setups which only gave me 400k all in all I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone as rockstar is really milking this game for the money and not fixing it for the fans

"Grand Theft Auto V GTA V is the quintessential openworld game and even years after its initial release it stands as a testament to the sheer brilliance of Rockstar Games The games arrival on Steam marks an opportunity for gamers old and new to immerse themselves in the sprawling chaotic and endlessly captivating world of Los Santos

Set in the fictional state of San Andreas GTA V tells the intertwining tales of three complex characters Michael a retired bank robber seeking a life of luxury Franklin a skilled repo man eager to escape the streets and Trevor a maniacal force of nature with an insatiable appetite for chaos The storytelling is nothing short of cinematic drawing players into a world of highstakes heists betrayals and a satirical take on modern American culture

The first thing that hits you when you enter Los Santos is the sheer scope of the world The city is a living breathing entity with its inhabitants going about their daily lives contributing to the feeling that youre part of something much larger The attention to detail is staggering from the sparkling skyscrapers to the gritty crimeinfested neighborhoods The game world is a playground that oozes authenticity

GTA V is not just about the story its about the freedom it offers You can jump into countless side activities from racing and sports to skydiving and basejumping The world is your oyster and the depth of content is astounding The heists in particular are standout moments that showcase the games strategic depth and cinematic flair

Gameplay is a perfect blend of shooting driving and general mayhem The controls are tight and the variety of vehicles at your disposal makes exploration enjoyable The shooting mechanics are topnotch and the cover system is a godsend during intense gunfights Whether youre evading the police chasing down criminals or just cruising through the city the gameplay is endlessly engaging

Online multiplayer is where GTA V truly shines GTA Online takes everything great about the singleplayer experience and lets you share it with friends or compete against other players in a massive everevolving world From heists to races free roam activities and ambitious playercreated content GTA Online provides a seemingly limitless array of experiences all while allowing you to build your criminal empire

Visually GTA V still impresses even years after its release The PC version on Steam offers the best graphics with support for high resolutions detailed textures and customizable settings that make the game look even more breathtaking The attention to detail extends to the dynamic weather and daynight cycle which contribute to the immersive experience

While GTA V is a masterpiece its not without its controversy particularly due to its mature themes violence and satirical commentary However for those who can appreciate the game for what it isan openworld work of artit offers a thrilling and unforgettable experience

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V on Steam is a musthave for any gaming enthusiast Its a testament to the boundless creativity and ambition of Rockstar Games offering a world thats a playground for chaos storytelling and exploration If you havent yet experienced the brilliance of Los Santos theres never been a better time to dive in and see what all the hype is about"

its really fun
"The single player is legendary of course 
But online this game is literally nothing but hackers griefers It is actually astounding how many of them there are Not even worth it unless you too are cheating I guess Hackers are in random missions death matches races you name it none of them are playable   You cant even roam around in a free roam lobby without some toxic clown emptying your inventory of all weapons changing your car making your car fly across the map or blow up 1000 times in a second to crash your game For that I honestly can not recommend this game to anyone Watching paint dry is more fun than this game is online"
its gta
very nice
game is ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
amazing prostitutes but also an incredible story and super free to play i love murdering innocent npcs
Decided to do my first fooligan job just now since I recently came back from a break and I wish I never came back My homing missiles would either fly under the vehicle I was locked onto or just go straight past it the insurgents had marksman aim even when I wasnt facing them after both my helicopters got destroyed I got in my car and just got demolished by a missile the insurgents were sat behind hills lasering me and the other merry weather guards were sat behind trees killing me in like one shot Once I even tried running down a hill after checking it was clear and got headshot from a helicopter that literally spawned right in front of me Dont get me wrong I love challenging gun fights but when it takes me half an hour to finish one part of not even a proper mission its just taking the piss

"GTA V was apart of many childhoods including mine Before it got butchered with online updates

Pros

 Graphics especially it being first released on Old Gen consoles that have less then a GB of RAM by the way The PS3 had 512MB and The Xbox 360 also had 512 MB

 Physics despite it being a downgrade compared to GTA IV its still very great and way ahead of its time

 Open World to this day GTA V is probably the greatest free roam of all time in an open world The cars movies buying clothing robberies really anything you can think of honestly

 Story its just iconic Three main characters living the American Dream

 RAGE Engine now this is somewhat apart of the Graphics section I mentioned but I have to talk about the fact that this Engine got made 10 years ago And still holds up to this particular day and age Absolutely amazing

 Map Design Los Santos is a really great map just a very well made replica of LA

 The Modding capabilites I to this day Play this game Modded FiveM the VR Mod Steering wheel support Trainers it really blows out the competition in different games that dont come with modding support

 AtD Attention to Detail R has added alot of AtD to GTA V like the flip flops that Michael can wear literally flip flop

 The Radio the music catalogue in GTA V is very fitting and well thought of R to increase the immersion and make it really feel like a Radio Station the announcers the music the licenses its pretty great honestly

Cons

 Alot parts of the map are Wasteland what do I mean by saying this well despite the map being pretty large Theres alot of spots that are just hills sand and it just gets repititive like Oh hey I have been here before

 All sidecharacters are in my opinion very irritating Despite for example people like Debra while Trevor lived at Vespucci Even though we only get to really see her once in a cutscene before she got killed by Trevor you really could tell how much of an annoyance she would have been if she didnt die

 GTAO back then it was more about being a criminal in online and really playing like it was meant to be Nowadays its filled with Jets MK2 and shark cards that get bought with moms credit cards lovely

Overall

If your looking for a great SP game good Graphics even nowadays and modding capabilites Then you should definetly buy this However the online is at an all time low Its not necessarily great and as mentioned its filled with people who just blow you up so if you really want to play online Just go into Passive Mode"
still good

dont ask me why this game is good
Efing Awesome
it be goooooooooddddd game
I am a 35 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 16 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
Rockstar killed Luke Rosss REAL VR mod for GTA V
yawa
retarded social club and support mediocre company so out of touch
This is one of the funniest outrageous games ever  Humor in most everything  A parody of life in Los Angeles The story is great fun You can play any one of the three main characters at any time after you play through some of the story and for a short time a dog  Listen to the many funny nonplayable characters voices The missions are challenging And even when you dont feel like following the story you can experiment as much as you want explore the sandbox that is its open world  I have played numerous hours every so often since  the game was released I find it a good stress relief from a tough day at work forget about things for a while  If you have never played this masterpiece I highly recommend you try it

"No overarching plot leads to events feeling very disconnected Its got a very inconsistent tone it both doesnt take itself seriously and takes itself too seriously 

Lets compare this to GTA IV GTA IV had a dark gritty tone and serious story Despite this it was still able to crack jokes at times and be lighthearted Most of all the jokes didnt suck and werent dropped every 5 minutes GTA IVs missions also all connected together and interwove a tight plot that was entertaining

I suppose it plays fine but its just really meh otherwise"
good game but i need mony
Great Game even 10 years after its release Great Graphics and great to play with friends
"Listen just buy it
You came to this page youre here for GTA Online
Buy it"
"GTA5 is still the most played age restricted game for a reason
 GTA5 campaign has Trevor
 GTA5 online has free expansions and weekly deals
 GTA5 online on PC has cheaters You can change servers to avoid cheaters or Orbital Cannon them until they leave 
 Rockstar put vehicles behind paywall and betrayed me after heist
 Stunt camera killed me
 Every expansion injures a GTA6 developer"
If you play with someone to fund every little thing you do this game is phenomenal Just needed that virtual sugar daddy
It is so fun and would highly recommend

Its GTAV I dont care for the online aspect of it but the Single Player offerings have been more than enough to   to bring me back to Los Santos time and again through the years Some missions are a slog specially the ones where you need to cross the map on a truck or some other slow vehicle but there are widely available quality of life mods that make these kinds of activities much more bearable such as the autodrive options in something like ENT  a must have for me personally
"When I first payed it I was not impressed But ten years later after a decade going backward in terms of games quality I can say this game is a masterpiece 

Still worth it in 2023 the graphics are still surprisingly good the scenario is all you can expect from this type of game and the city is just amazing 

Also if you like this game please try Sleeping Dogs still also worth it in 2023 with better hand to hand combats and amazing car chases"

A LIKED THE MODS AND THAT SUUF A  HATE THE BLOOD SO YEAH BYE
Good game
Removing vehicles that had been around for around 10 years from the in game stores was a really bad move in my opinion The only thing else I have to say is that cheaters infest and disrupt lobbies while going unpunished themselves and it is pretty easy to not need to do anything in the online to get money I mean you can play the game it just sucks a bit more now
Im exited to see gta 6
I am wanted in 38 counties for vehicular manslaughter and financial fraud
I dont understand why youd want to drive all mad hit pedestrians rob a convenient store and do it all again if you could just do it in real lif
it is quite a fun and exciting game i really like it
why must you punish the mod community shame

For the love of all that is holy in the world do not ing buy this game do not play gta online ever
i like this game it gives me so many emotions
a classic cant wait for gta 6
just got on pc super fun always played on xbox since 2017
still fucking sucks
story is decent online multiplayer is a 10 year old cashgrab almost entirely unapproachable for new players due to the astronomical buyin cost of any and all moneymaking opportunities and thats if you dont get suckered into draining your starter cash on something you might actually want such as a vehicle or fancyconveniently located apartment home its a mess of modders and hackers that you will most definitely encounter though there is an option now for private lobbies however incomes are diminished so you are actively discouraged from playing with only your friends
i love this game i feel like its a little short but i say this is the best game in the world right now let your kids play it there is so much learning aboutr the real world in this game
LOVE IT
its fucking gta

This game should be the best game of all time We should all be on there with IRL friends new friends weve met around Los Santos but no Its all a distraction machine to get people to spend money This game came out ten years ago and still takes several minutes to boot up and then several minutes to join any lobby It is a disaster of performance and a model of greed in its monetization

Ill cut it right to the point this is a good game that could be great IF they would moderate the servers ALOT better  who am i kidding if they even moderate at all  When you venture onto the live servers  be prepared for many many toxic encounters You will have to just deal with it at this point it seems since it appears to be the way Rockstar wants it Even if you spend real money on great gear IT JUST WONT MATTER The modders good or bad negate everything that could give you a legitimate edge
It is fun I like running over hookers and police men i would pick up a hooker do the deed then shoot her for the money back woohoo free head

Overall  Grand Theft Auto V is an insane experience The missiontomission beats are a blast to play through Each character offers a unique perspective to the city of Los Santos The heist missions are a ton of fun and the story pacing feels fast and thrilling The character development is surprisingly well done There are a ton of missions and side missions to complete you could easily spend hundreds of hours doing everything Had a pretty great time with this one  Highly Recommended

After the Cayo Perico heist reward nerf nerf is putting it lightly its not worth doing at all anymore very few things are left to actually make decent money in game anymore They are trying to force players to buy these Sharkcards never have never will It was cool for a bit but greed is the downfall of many games these days RIP

this is the best game even if its 11 years old never getting boared
Best of all time
Current GTA V is a walking L Oppressor Mk2 is the sole reason Lazy content updates and Nerfs to all the fun shit doesnt help as well as actually removing content that was already there and charging money for it is the worst decision ever Anyone whos actively giving this game a thumbs up in 2023 is a fucking idiot who supports one of the worst publishers ever
the game is amazing but only thing is my potato laptop cant handle it but i love the game watched many videos on youtube and this is the first time playing
Good game
good gam my is next is gta 4
Definitely Worth purchasing
i lost my acc i sad

i dont like playing this game do not buy the game
I really want to play again this game again because i uninstall it for lack of storage but for some reason i couldnt log in back in the game for this fkn SOCIAL CLUB and the password of it is in my broken CP whatever i do to try to create new account they will say THE STEAM ACCOUNT IS ALREADY LINKED TO A DIFFERENT SOCIAL CLUB ACCOUNT PLEASE LOG IN TO YOUR SOCIAL CLUB ACCOUNT INSTEAD Those MF in Rockstar want us to DIRECTLY buy again the game again in their ROCKSTAR bllsht site whatever it is so frustrating if i were you dont uninstall it

goooooooooooooood

Rockstar has somehow kept this alive for 50000 years GTA VI will have an extremely high standard to live up to Is mostly fun with friends to do missions or heists The grind to get money is crazy hard but once you have stuff the game gets kind of boring Servers are riddled with hackers and Oppressor Mk IIs that make anyone who isnt a participant miserable Occasionally you will come across lobbies where everyone is wholesome and those moments make it so worth it  Car meets chases just messing around having fun with strangers and good vibes 810 overall Curious for GTA6
"its kind of hard say no to all of this content i got this on sale for roughly 35 dollars AUD with the criminal starter pack version 
this is the 3rd time ive purchased gta 5 over several consoles and it never fails to disappoint most content in game can be purchased through playing the game or you can purchase shark cards to speed things up a little

honestly if you want gta 5 go get it you wont regret it"
Im not sure how the reviews on this game are so good Its a masterpiece but the online play is awful Constant disconnections awful interfaces for every menu pay to win items Its basically unplayable with friends with someone always disconnecting
very fun
oh baby oh oh niggers oh the strip club women made my little snake grow grow
It fun
awesome and epic
Having played on each variation of Xbox console since Day one of the game and logging thousand plus hours of playtime To recently buying the PC version only to discover progress is non transferable and I have to start from scratch again which is annoying enough but to also find I cannot replace my vehicles because Rockstar has seen fit to remove them from the game is the final insult I will not be buying anymore Rockstar games As they are now no more than A blatant cash grab
sexy wemen so hat wuld smacsh cuz so cute and spice

itsd a good game i just cant klog in because my account got hacked

its a great Realistic game and you will find lots of friends
I liked it
this is garbage how old is this game and its having numerous errors w the game launcher one i cant even uninstall has so many components required just to launch this mid game in the year ive owned it ive only been able to get 7 hrs of this pathetic game rockstars gotta be the laziest and unmotivated greedy scumbag developer in existance wish i could get a refund on this garbage
good

very good
I purchased this game to play with my sons  Unfortunately it is impossible to play online with more than one computer in the same household  We each have our own licensed copy but only one of us can connect to an online game with friends  This issue has been posted all over the internet and the publisher has not done a thing to address it  Do a google search before wasting your money  I am not likely to purchase anything associated with Rockstar Games after this
the best game ever you need play

Gta v is probably the best gta game The world of the game feels alive The map is big but i still remember every single spot on it Los antos is well designed You have differences in each part of the city like rich neighborhoods or gang occupied ones The story with its 3 different characters is well written The gameplay is smooth shooting is great and driving is fun Also running around killing people is also fun in this game
"cant access game due to your extra trash for no reason launcher nice

GTA VI should be out at this time tbh
Not Bad
To big for my harddrive never got to play
Awesome game awesome awesome game But please adjust for GTA6 dont even care if its addressed on this game The average joe policegangstermercenary helicopter gunman are way overpowered in terms of accuracy A lazerguided robot wouldnt be that accurate The player character is supposed to be one of the most talented characters in the game whilst riding with other players or computers and with aim assist I find it very difficult to hit targets therefore it should be at least that hard for the average chopper gunman now I would understand a boss or even several stronger chopper characters but these every day chopper gunman have curving bullets and xray vision hell they hit you before your can apply armor after respawns cant believe its gone 10 years like this That is all Also I have a great RDRGTA idea but I think its worth far too much money to share on here

"A LOT OF BUGS AND CHEATERS THESE FACTORS RUIN THE IMPRESSION OF THE GAME MAXIMUM WHEN I TRY TO PASS THE SAME THING 4 TIMES AT FIRST BECAUSE OF A BUG THE PHOTOS DO NOT COUNT AT ALL I HAVE TO WAIT A DAY THEN THE CHEATER TELEPORTS TO THE OTHER END OF THE MAP INTO THE SKY AND ALL AGAIN IM REALLY SICK OF THIS THIS GAME HAS HUGE PROBLEMS WITH BUGS AND CHEATERS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IM WRITING SUCH A REVIEW HAVING ALMOST 1000 HOURS OF PLAYING I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY THAT SOME UPDATES DO NOT INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER THE DEVELOPMENT TEAMS APPEAR TO WORK SEPARATELY EVERYTHING IS RELEASED ONLY AS WELL AS IT WORKS MORE OR LESS THEN IT IS DISCOVERED A LOT OF BUGS
CHEATERS CAN DO ANYTHING IN EACH SESSION GIVE YOU MONEY PLAY YOU THE INTRODUCTORY FILM OF GTA ONLINE TELEPORT YOU ANYWHERE ETC
I WOULD GIVE THE GAME 810 BUT BECAUSE OF BUGS AND CHEATERS THE GAME DOESNT DESERVE HIGHER THAN 410"

Grand Theft Auto is most definitely the best way to kill time I absolutely love the heists and driving systems in this game You do not need anything big in the game to have some true fun I strongly suggest this game to anyone who has been debating on getting it Well worth the amount of money and so so much to do I love searching for random things as the map has so many things and secret easter eggs too

"Ive owned this game a long time and now I cant play it When I bought it my teenage daughter was sharing my account and the game is tied to one of her old rockstar accounts apparently Shes now an adult and not living with us but before she moved out we created her own steam account and I bought her her own copy of this game Up until now none of this was a problem It was just logged in

But I made this simple mistake of upgrading one of my hard drives I cloned it to a larger faster SSD but in the process Windwows gave it a different letter It suddenly was looking for the launchersocial club on a drive letter that didnt exist and it said I didnt have space to install it A little googling shows a consensus that this is a know issue and the only way to solve it is to use a 3rd party uninstaller to remove every trace of the old program 

I did that and it let me reinstall it Finally But now it wants me to log in with an account that was set up with my daughter close to a decade ago Theres no way around it I cant log in with a new account or with my own rockstar account that is tied to other games I own on this same steam account I would buy another copy just to not have to deal with this BS but I cant do that in Steam with my existing account and even my daughter isnt able to help me So do I have to create a new steam account to play this game Rockstar sucks"

IDK how but they keep making it worse this patch broke car garages car physics and made cops invulernable to all damage for me how ROCKSTAR managed to fuck this up is beyond me saying this game is almost old enough to fucking drive they just seem to take any community advice and do the opposite go find someone else to take your money that makes it seem like they care about their customers
100
This game is fun when you have other people to actually play with unlike playing by yourself
Everyone on PC should be voting this as a NEGATIVE review or change their reviews to Negative after Rockstar took away about 180 available cars to buy from us PC users  to top it off you need GTA paid subscription to buy those cars that were taken away but to make things even worse Rockstar Games GTA paid subscription isnt available on PC only nextgen They robbed us Rockstar Games has lost the plot What a joke They have cheated us all

Bought the Steam version of this game after purchasing three Xbox versions and one PC version  I bought it solely to use with Luke Rosss VR mod and it was pretty cool  Rock Star were blanks and constantly kept updating stuff to make it not work which made it less enjoyable  Then they outright shut down Luke Rosss mod  I have been playing GTA series since GTA3  I dont think that I will buy another game from them  They can thank Luke Ross for the last two games I own RDR2 also

The only thing id watch out for is getting your account stolen by hackers like mine did I cant even recover it
"Ok saya merubah review saya menjadi positif lagi pada GTA V onlline karena ada solo private session yg membuat saya senang Tetap harus selalu waspada ketika anda main GTA V online pada public session  setiap uang yg anda dapat secepat mungkin langsung deposit ke bank sebelum para modder dan cheater merampok anda dan secepatnya pindah session baru ketika situasi mulai rusuh oleh para modders dan cheaters

Untuk Rockstar  Tolong rubah aturan penggantian nickname dari setahun sekali menjadi sebulan atau seminggu sekali agar kami bisa terhindar dari Bully para modder dan cheater yg sudah hapal nickname kami"

the online is such a microtransaction focused hell of unbearable nightmarish proportions it actually ruins any positive review that could be held for the story mode
GTA 5 is a masterpiece that seamlessly blends stunning graphics a compelling storyline and unparalleled freedom of exploration The gaming experience is truly unparalleled providing a sense of boundless freedom in a virtual world full of life From epic missions to simple activities like car races or just wandering through Los Santos every moment in GTA 5 delivers unexpected joy This game is not just a play its an adventure worth exploring
Awesome

"i love robbing banks cooking acid growing weed and blowing up cars

i wonder if GTA will be fun too"
WHERE THE FUCK IS GTA 6
gunz go brrrrrrr
Has a lot of variety
A little violent though
"GTA V  Online is a load of fun if you have friends that will play in a private session with you I cannot attest to the public sessions as I avoid them actively But if you dont have friends you can still solo it will just take you longer to achieve the same ends Example Caya Pericho has a 25 hour cooldown solo and 45 min cooldown with a partner or group 

With that said I keep coming back for more as I am a social gamer

Highly recommend for other social gamers"

Been out 10 years definitely put more than 54 hours thats for sure but a great game for the last ten years and would definitely recommend it Check it out and see how you like it
i love it
fun lots of anger
"Has become pay to cheat in so many levels
Delivery Missions are so repetitive it gets old really quick
Rockstar decreased rewards from Missions maybe to incentive Hacks  more likely
There are a lot of bugs I cant even number them all But for instance you spend a lot of money to get a fully upgraded Nightclub then it just stops working properly and you have to buy another one because that one bugged your products productions
You ask for a vehicle and it spawn miles away for no apparent reason
Something you wont get the rewards after spending 30 minutes of a pointless mission because of Transaction Bug
Enemies will spawn on weird places killing you after you made sure the coast was clear
Enemies wont stop spawning until you follow the script  which most of the time is annoying
If you go into a business you have a 2 chance of blackscreen
Endless miles on slow trucks delivering stuff that could easily placed on top of a V8 Truck and speed the crap out of the sale instead of wasting time driving 10mph
Everything is expensive and mission rewards are low Thats why theres so many cheaters hacks and modders online
Rockstar bans people for cheating at the Casino but keeps GodMode morons teleporting about ruining Open Activities

Overall better downloading a F2P wannabe GTA than paying and paying for cards to be outclassed by any random guy with access to a hacks forum"
i always get kick if i join to new season and i have to restar 100 time to get online again and that 100 time is still gacha if i can join then probably after 10 minute play the social club is offline again even my network is working prety good NO RTO NO JUMP PING SINCE THIS GAME DINT HAVE ADMIN CONTROL SO I THINK AM GONNA TOXIC THIS GAME JUST TO MAKE OTHER PEOPLE QUIT THIS GAME
i just want to play gta 5 but i have to make stupid account
It is soooo fun

"This game commits the unforgivable sin in all of gaming selling the game on steam but then having a separate launcher I didnt pay 80 of my hard earned money to jump through more hoops and then get soft locked out of my game because it didnt remember my sign in information Emails to get my password changed go nowhere and every action requires a tedious captcha that a robot could very easily fool

It sucks being locked out of what could be a very good game through a garbage third party launcher and vague unhelpful support FAQs from an enormous faceless organisation Least of all when I paid my money for it"

"Love when I get rammed by someone from behind and then he shoots all up my back

i have been playing for about a month and a half and every online game i join is just every player is modding and making everyone who just wants to play the game 1 last time before gta 6 have a horrible time i cant play the game without being spawn killed or being teleported into the air
"I dont know were to far down this games life to know what to say really 

Its awesome to finally have friend only lobbies with no punishment for not being public 
But the game is so full of hackers and so full of bot accounts now that its hard to say public lobbies are good for anything anyway 

Theres the RP world servers and mods I guess but most of them are run by hypocrites or have long since been abandon by the people who used them 

GTA 4  5 have just come and gone the same way  it had its time in the sun  but now its a modders hellscape and you cant play the game anymore 

Also rockstar is a bunch of irredeemable money grubbing A5H0l  who made the game unplayable without hacking in money prices on everything are to high now If you dont have a solid 200hours to put into the game you cant afford a business off the regular jobs anymore  

So in short if youre new to the game looking to play the game  save your money"

GTA V is one of the games that I spent a lot of time learning since the structures are quite complex Despite the high price and engulf massive storage I still bought the game and played with my peers The game contains absolutely wonderful graphics and details though there are violence and sexual content that are exist There are several activities to do task mission heist business race etc Overall I think it is worthy to buy the game during the discount season

"This game is perfectly balanced for cheaters and temporary account buyers
A 5 account can permit you to record youTube nonsense about laughing of poor player who dont have billions of GTA cash and allowed you to feel like a MAN riding your flying motorcycle with invincibility cheat mode even before you get your first facial hairs for the low low price of messing and discouraging others fair players who only wants to wine down after a tough day at school or work depending if you live in an occidental country or where the minimum age for legal work is as soon as you can hold the required tool
Years ago that was a great game i had more then my share of that game nearly a thousand hours but since Crooked Star inc cancelled the dunces cap I supposed nobody know but there are only cheaters cheating cheaters and that is a mouth full only saying it so imagine playing it
The thing i never understood is those games with the most annoying and unnecessary proprietary launcher are the games with the most cheaters
I guess 77 billions is not enough to pay for game admin or research in new anti cheat tech

Croocked Star Yes but we have the ban player option and that work perfectly
Players But it take many days so our game session is ruined Imagine a FIFA world event where no soccer ball would keep is inflation on the event day and the soccer ball companies would answer come back in 2 days our balloon will be ok then just rent few more night a the hotel and dont worry the air plane companies will be OK with that Pinky swear wink wink  

Ladys and gentlemen come with your hard earn money and get  by the MK2 Oppressor driven by a not hardware banned  player 
At least the Nascar race are fun"

A masterpiece GTA V Simply take in the worlds size and complexity the graphics the dynamics and the music As with practically any game the online component has its ups and downs and may occasionally get rough if youre new switch to passive mode right away and find another session when certain kids experience rage issues However the amount of thought put into the content more than makes up for this

Want to remember what it feels like to be on the internet in the late 90searly 2000s Welcome to GTAV  Do you miss waiting 10 minutes praying for something to load only for it to fail at the last minute Do you miss when gaming was full of rampant cheating and fraud Do you miss getting popups CONSTANTLY Well come play GTAV and experience all the joys

WHEN GTA VI RELEASE 
Grand Theft Auto as of making this review is almost 10 years old Sure this game is 10 years old but I think it sure as hell still holds up The community is pretty good of course there are lots of trolls and modders but putting that out of the way you have a really fun game Story mode is good but if you want a revolutionary story go get RDR2 if you just want a fun time Get GTA especially on sale Cannot wait for GTA 6

h2 Graphics and Visuals h2

  Graphics quality and detail The games graphics have come a long way since 2013 and they continue to impress
  Art style and design The openworld of Los Santos is meticulously designed creating a vibrant and immersive environment
  Performance and optimization The game runs smoothly on a midrange PC and the transition from console to PC was seamless
h2 Gameplay h2

  Controls and responsiveness The controls are intuitive allowing for seamless navigation and actionpacked gameplay
  Mechanics and gameplay depth GTA V offers a wide range of activities and missions keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging
  Pacing and balance The pacing is excellent offering both thrilling action and moments of relaxation
h2 Story and Narrative h2

  Character development The characters especially the three protagonists are welldeveloped and add depth to the narrative
  Immersion and engagement GTA Vs immersive world keeps you coming back for more even after years of play
h2 Audio and Sound h2

  Soundtrack and music The games intense soundtrack sets the mood for highstakes action 
  Sound effects Realistic sound effects play a critical role in gameplay 
  Voice acting You Forget A Thousand Things Every Day Pal Make Sure This Is One Of Em  Iconic line from the games voice acting Memes like this have become legendary in the gaming community 
h2 Content and Replayability h2

  Game length GTA Vs story mode is substantial and the online mode adds endless hours of gameplay
  Replay value The games replay value is exceptional with every match offering a unique challenge 
  Unlockables and collectibles Unlocking new operators and skins adds to the excitement 
h2 Multiplayer if applicable h2

  Multiplayer functionality Multiplayer is the heart of GTA Online but its important to note that there are no more DLC updates coming to the game
  Online community and matchmaking The online community is thriving with players sharing strategies and memes However its important to mention that future developments for GTA Online might be limited due to the possible release of GTA 6 in the coming years 
  Stability and connection quality Connection quality is generally stable 
h2 Bugs and Technical Issues h2

  Gamebreaking bugs While there have been occasional bugs the development team is usually quick to address them
  Minor glitches Minor issues do pop up but they often lead to funny moments 
  Patch and update history Regular updates and patches keep the game fresh and balanced 
h2 Community and Support h2

  Developer responsiveness The developers actively engage with the community listening to feedback and making improvements 
  Modding support Modding isnt officially supported but the communitys creative content is impressive 
  Community forums and discussions The GTA V community forums and discussions can be both a valuable resource and a place of toxicity and rudeness Its a mixed bag where youll occasionally encounter both friendly and unsavory players 
h2 Final Thoughts h2

  Pros and highlights Tactical gameplay depth of strategy vibrant community and unforgettable moments
  Cons and drawbacks The game can be difficult for new players due to its grind and the hours needed to be put in and the communitys occasional toxicity can be discouraging Playing with friends can significantly enhance the experience
  Would you recommend this game Absolutely especially if you enjoy intense tactical shooters and appreciate a community that embraces humor and memes Be prepared for a steep learning curve and occasional encounters with unfriendly players And you might encounter cheaters and hackers on PC Also keep in mind that there are no more DLC updates planned for GTA Online and the possible release of GTA 6 in the coming years could change the landscape Nevertheless its a game that never loses its charm and youll find yourself saying You Forget A Thousand Things Every Day Pal Make Sure This Is One Of Em just for fun
h2 Additional comments h2
Having played GTA V since 2013 I can confidently say its a game that never gets old The transition to PC was smooth and even though hackers can occasionally disrupt the experience playing with friends makes up for it The storyline remains a standout and while a powerful PC isnt required a midrange modern PC handles the game well Keep in mind that the online mode can be grindy but theres no shortage of activities to keep you entertained in Los Santos With the possibility of GTA 6 on the horizon its an exciting time to be a GTA fan

hrhr

h1 Overall Summary h1
Grand Theft Auto V continues to shine in 2023 as a tactical masterpiece with an engaging storyline and a vibrant online community While newcomers may find the games complexity challenging playing with friends enhances the experience However its important to note that there are no more DLC updates planned for GTA Online and the possible release of GTA 6 in the coming years could change the landscape of the series Despite these considerations GTA V remains a timeless classic that offers countless hours of enjoyment in the sprawling world of Los Santos where even iconic lines like You Forget A Thousand Things Every Day Pal Make Sure This Is One Of Em have become legendary memes in the gaming community"

"won a car at the casino but it must have been in real life since they desperately did not want to give it to me Basically what happened was once i won the car it froze up my game and i couldnt move thus allowing them to keep the car for themselves instead 

You may now take this buggy mess of a Video Game forever off of steam and everywhere else and release GTA6 NOW"

GTA 5 offers a thrilling mix of gameplay experiences Its a game that lets players live out their criminal fantasies while also providing a sharp critique of modern society all set to a soundtrack that captures the essence of Los Angeles GTA 5 is a genredefining title that offers an unmatched level of freedom chaos and entertainment in the world of gaming
BETTER THAN GTA 6

this game is awesome The amount of effort the devs put into this game is surreal I will say that this game has a lot of violence and swearing but as long as you are ok with that it is a great game I also find it hard to navigate the map and earn money as well as trying to install fiveM and such
Trevors cool
best open world game ever
really good
best game ever created 1000 hours love it
L
good
Been playing this game since day one only wish i could of brought my game play from my ps3 to pc the grind sucks
very good
"Its an addicting game but still super buggy Its even worse if you want to actually play online with other players as the load times are horrendous and they get even worse when there is an inevitable modder in the server If you havent started playing GTA online dont bother unless you want to spend half of your session on your phone during the loading screens

And dont even get me started on Rockstars greedy practices Removing around 200 vehicles that can be bought back easier with GTA plus nerfing Cayo Perico heist again and again holding some ten year anniversary items behind a paywall GTA plus thats just whats on the tip of my tongue 

I kinda wish I never started playing because now I cant stop which subjects me to hours of frustration when I want to play with other players I strongly suggest finding another game to get addicted to

EDIT I somehow failed to mention that if the load times in public lobbies werent bad enough the modders will make things worse You are GUARANTEED to run into a modder who will do anything they can to ruin your experience from constantly blowing you up to destroying your product and sometimes spawning you elsewhere out of the blue Its an absolute s h i t show"
This is my best friend br
Lots of hackers in my opinion but the game overall is great
this game is amazing thank you so much i would like to be police if you could do a update that we can be police tysm
luv this game thanku devs for making such a outstanding game also fuck u zane u stink
just go for itit is an once in a life time experience
i
I have played for more than 15 hours and still not bored but this game is next level waiting for GTA 6 release

Best game
I liked it
"Incredibly astoundingly amazing remarkably HORRIBLE online play experience because the utterly rampant cheating  The singleplayer for some reason called Story Mode is actually pretty fun But when thats over since there isnt really a difficulty rating you can adjust the only thing left is the online multiplayer mode  Presumably if you have a good group of friends who will NOT be cheating then this is probably also pretty fun  Unfortunately the public online experience is really just a gigantic systemically empowered griefer utopia

So yeah parts of this are very fun its certainly visually gorgeous But replayability and longevity are extremely limited  Dont fool yourself into It cant be that bad because its utterly insanely filthy with cheats that have bizarre superpowers and will make you regret wasting the time trying"
it a w
I liked the story in the game including the online story line I played this game on the Xbox 360 Xbox One and Xbox Series S I bought the PC version because I wanted to experience the GTA Online chaos on PC The hackers can be troublesome but they make the game more interesting in how you play it Yes this game is old but its still a lot of fun
Skibidi Toilet Fanum Tax Ohio Rizz in Ohi
Indisputably one of the greatest and most entertaining games of all time Even with Rockstars stellar track record of new games I remain unconvinced that the GTA VI experience will be able to top the iconic status reached by GTA V Fingers crossed that thats not the case
GTA 6 Pls
very good for 10 year olds

"Hello I just wanted to say that I am having this issue similar to many others and after looking at some of the reviews on the game that I have enjoyed ever since i got it back in like 2017 I am going to tell my story about Rockstar Games and how they barley do anything regarding peoples accounts getting compromised without them knowing My Rockstar Social Club Account has since got hijacked without me knowing and I cannot play both GTA IV GTA V and RDR 2 anymore due to the Rockstar Social Club Account that is linked to my Steam Account being hijacked I have since lost the Original Email to the Rockstar Social Club Account and I probably need to buy another copy of GTA V GTA IV and RDR 2 somewhere else so thanks to Rockstar with their unacceptable actions and barley helping me with anything regarding this issue I have no way to play the games made by them anymore I have since lost all of my respect as a company and a corporation Rockstar has further damaged their reputation as a company to myself and many others and I sense that there is gonna probably be a lawsuit about this whole thing soon and Ill be waiting for some kind of thing that will fix all of this

Thank you for taking your time to read all of this

Best Game Ever tbh
I ONLY recommend this game if you like story and modding otherwise at this point its a scam if you want any gear whatsoever without getting griefed or messed with youll need at least 150 dollars to buy the essential survival items for online this game gets frequent updates which is cool until you realize none of them bring content to story mode and youll need to buy more currency developers are also busy with gta 6 meaning if you have any issues with the game your better off going to Reddit for support
me encata
I find it good but for a better review on this game ask much more experienced crazyefo1412

DO NOT BUY ON PC WAY BETTER OFF ON CONSOLE unless you are a piece of st modder who likes to destroy the game for others online Seriously if you so much as fart around a modder they will crash your game to desktop or worse GTA 5 online Pc is absolute garbage i will buy a ps5 to play this rather than use my pc with a 4090 gpu the game is fantastic without modders online GTA is my favorite game series ever and i loved gta5 on my ps4 but made a mistake and switched my account to pc

ridiculously dumb gameplay in online repeating the same boring missions a million times driving around the map for 15 minutes to get 3040k seriously Especially stupid idea of the makers working for goods then having other mostly cheating players destroy your delivery car and you lose the hour of time you put in collecting it Just dumb sorry

"Terrible trash game Singleplayer was great when it was new The online is 100 microtransaction garbage designed to waste your time and punish you for trying to progress
Thankfully FiveM exists which is what the majority of PC players play now however FiveM is mostly full of roleplay servers like GMOD DarkRP which negates any potential fun you could have with it because 13 year old admins on powertrips"

I got it on a discount for 999 and it was so fucking worth it I love this game You can enjoy Online mode where they They completly milked the game like i wish my gf did with me tho And u realy feel that online mode is without any love and no love to details But the Story mode The Story mode is always fun to play and is with so much love to details and so much to explore
This game is dream since I was born
very interesti
Had no life for 250h on pc and 2k hours on ps4 
Bad game feels awful and sluggish to control Online full of hackers

Still the GOAT of games even after all these years I really enjoy playing this game
good game and nice grafics
My grades dropped faster than gta 6 leaks after playing this game
OK
very nice
The only thing Rockstar cares about is selling shark cards they are constantly taking things away to bring them back either time gated or hidden behind GTA plus its nothing more than a money grab at this point they keep making it worse to try and push people to buy more shark cards and GTA plus Rockstar is a Hollow shell of its former self and care for nothing but how much they can take from you Story gameplay and fun take a backseat to the money grab its just gross
"This game has story mode offline by yourself
 and online mode you and your friends enemies strangers griefers everyone else

This review is mostly for the online portion of the game
First its a great game

They do weekly updates so every week new stuff is on sale different cars different businesses usually
and theyll change some of the payouts on different tasks heists and businesses

Theres daily tasks you can do that respawn every day in different places as well

It can be a car game a fighting game a shooting game a heist game

The empire building part is what I like
 start a business and set it up most of them can make passive money whenever youre online 
 Arcade Agency Night Club Drug labs Bunker Aircraft Hangar tons of heists arena racing auto shop bike shop warehouses private military stuff whatever you want
And you can run everything all at once

Or you can just run around killing strangers for no reason you will get killed right back though

Game has lots of flaws character mechanics are weird but its a 10 year old game
Its alos really frustrating sometimes either because of some other weird game mechanic or because some rando on the internet decides to give you grief for no reason its part of the game

You can set up private friend only or crew only lobbies now and still do all the missions so I run my nightclub like that do the daily stuff and buy the things I want when they go on sale

I bought this game lots of times on lots of different systems PS3 PS4 PS5 and lots of PC guys
 PC is the best because you dont need to subscribe to PSPlus or Xbox Live to play online
 but there are advantages to playing on a current gen XboxPS console more content
I mostly stick to PC now though I do play on PS sometimes

It goes on sale for around 15 all the time buy it"
Trevor is GTA personified
great
only bad thing is R dont like modding so every update ruins all the mods 
mmmmm

As a Noob Pro Player of this game until now its enjoyable to play GTAV
"R encourages hackers Ive lost billions equal to hundreds of dollars rmt R wont refund it The only logical outcomes are to spend literal hundreds of dollars to make up for hundreds of hours of grinding or to mod the game yourself DO NOT PLAY ON STEAM You WILL have your account reset by modders You WILL have your cash stolen You WILL lose everything R will just tell you too bad git gud and leave you hanging out to dry
Since Im unwilling to mod Ill just sit in the poor corner"
Game is pretty fun when youre only playing with friends or by yourself Very much enjoyable when you play like that Dont join public lobbies Bunch of hackers that can access your information Overall fun game
Children can crash your game Online unplayable
the game is too good as an open world game but we cant save cars in story mode by locking the cars except the garages
good work
yes
Cant play without a Rockstar Social Account but when the account gets messed up somehow I cant use a new account without making a new steam account to link Decently fun game to be stupid with friends on but that only works when the game is playable Cant even get to offline campaign play as is which is ridiculous
Sometimes you can force skip loading screens by unplugging and plugging in your controller
Nice graphics
GRUDD GAME
its a  fantastic game
good
Yes

Great Where is male strip club how download sex mod
I got this game in 2017 only for a hacker to steal it in the next year When I took the account back in 2021 I had 25 billion dollars in the bank and most businesses Thank you Nordic hacker
Never heard so many Nwords within a span of 10 minutes
Modders and Hackers have destroyed the PC version of GTA Online Take Two Interactive is a 30 billion dollar company and they cannot fix the issues with modders The online component of GTA is completely unplayable and potentially unsafe to play due to modders obtaining IP addresses If I was the US Government I would investigate TTI and Rockstar for Privacy Violations This company needs to be examined under a microscope
if you want your insides blown out then buy the game or maybe your into that then PS for online
it lit
You forget a thousand things every day make sure this is one of them
good
Online this game is pure trash Offline or modded is the way to go 710
"its fun

because you get to shoot black NI"
GTA V will go down in history as the best game besides GTA 6
""
54 GB of your SSDHDD is wasted on the online portion You can delete the DLC folder which has most of the multiplayer content and still play single player but once theres an update to multiplayer youre SOL Steam wont let you launch the game without updating it So if you dont have enough space to download the update you cant play the game Rockstar should just separate the Single Player and Multiplayer as their own download I dont care for their predatory online BS MP game but I would love to finish the Singleplayer if they just let me save some space on my SSD
fun
cool

Best game ever And dont forget to download mod minu3 enjoy D
"Thats a beautiful game and I enjoy the graphics but I prefer the 4 on almost every other point

Writing is very weak Characters complaining about the mission they do for almost no reward is not how to create engaging gameplay
One character has the scenarium personnality He is unpreadictible in a way that is the main way for the scenario to advance from his introduction in the game
But sure driving aimlessly in a beautyffuly recreated pocket southern California is very fun"
superb
WE LOVE WE LIVE WE LIE
Thats such a slay moment
its fun to play with friends and story mode is good
I would not recommend this Although this game gave me weeks or even months of joy And I paid for it The update to another launcher is not worth it I recommend you guys get a pirated copy off of 1337x dot to And dont bother with this Seriously I would if I could
its a very fun game
Runs well
should play story not online or jhonny sins will curse you btw i am messaging on 699 hours because there are to nines two gurls

The online version is quite possibly the worst game ever made
"ai moderation

go watch YouTube subtitles and tell me how good they are and we expect rock star to do better 

single player was ok multiplayer was ALWAYS a hellscape of hackers and rockstar did fucking nothing to fix it but they sure as hell go after anyone who hacks some cash into the game or now says naughty words in an m rated game who japanese vtubers made famous for fun reasons"
good game very fun to dewind after a long day of study or being exploited by your employers
new player get after completing all mission
"After 8 years Rockstar finally broke their game

Removed most of the cars to drip feed them later at random to make them rare nerfed most of the mission payouts increased the cost of any popular vehicles

All to try to force more people to sign up to their GTA monthly payments

If this is the future then GTA 6 will be balls"
"Apparently at some point after my purchase Rockstar decided you needed to use their launcher and provide an email address which I never did so they did it for me

Now that Ive replaced my hardware Rockstar refuses to validate my copy because I dont know what that madeup email is It doesnt matter that I have the SteamKey CDKey and purchase date It doesnt matter that they made it up and it clearly ends with 123com

They taken my money and theyre perfectly content with that I warn anyone else against purchasing any Rockstar game in the future lest they decide you arent you anymore because of something they did"

This game sucks I tryied to buy it to play i had it in the past through the family share and because of a Steam and Rockstar games bug my account remained linked to my brother rockstar games account Steam and Rockstar does not care about my problem either they preffered to refund my money instead of fixing their stupid bug I cannot recommend this game because they dont care about your money I cannot either transfer it to another steam account via gift cards or buying the game for another account Steam and rockstar games sucks

"i only play gta online
there are to many hackers its like an pest and rockstard dont give a shit either
the lobbys needs 24 players for the heists witch is fine until the some one leaves a prep or in the heist and everyone get boted and you have to manually drive back most of the time to restart the heist again and again and again but if you can find proper people that know what to do and stays and dont leave you right befour the end check well then you might kicked buy a hacker at the end of the heist oh and not to forget to get agent or prisoner to actually move and follow you cause agent ulp mission that is 7030 chance he moves or not the loading screen is allso a lucky wheel to spin either it works fine or you have a black screen for 2 min or you have to restart the game however i find alot of aspects of the game interessting but the game gets old fast doing the same heist over and over again will get old and with people leaving the game etch  the hackers it gets even more Old faster id even say that you could try wow befour this game anestly but if you decide to try well the best of luck to you"

hahahahaha guided missle go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
The story mode is good it gives you a lot to do throughout the map while increasing the difficulty as you accomplish milestones The online game offers a similar experience but with the ability to do so with friends which makes it harder to make progress alone but it is doable
A Video Game Thats Like a Blockbuster Movie Only Better
good
fun
nice
Ever since i was 12 i loved gta online but over the years the content gets worse and worse removing more than giving always nerfing cayo and promoting sharkcards disgusting
Very fun Took me a long time to finish it
crahes like crazy
i love deepwoekn
love it
Rockstar rlly gotta do sumthing abt the modders
It really depends the story is amazing but when you finish it i think single player gets boring and gta online is boring nowadays too so id just get it for the story lets see how things will turn out with gta VI which is supposed to come at the end of 2024
A Rockstar Great Game But Story Mode Is The Best Experience That I Had And OnlineWell Online Is A Meh Not Great Enough Because We Players Need More Big Maps Like Las Venturas San Fierro And Countryside From The Always Beloved Classic GTA San Andreas
very good game gta i like Gta

"This can be the most entertaining game and most life regretting game to ever exist This is my most played game by far and I have no idea how I accumulated these hours so fast Just before typing this review I took 4 different painkillers irl to stay up past 2am to complete the stupid cayo berico heist with two of my hilariously retarded and autistic friends
I recommend playing this game with drugs and being sleep deprived if possible"

"Positive Comment

Grand Theft Auto V on PC is an absolute masterpiece when it comes to gaming The graphics are nothing short of breathtaking the level of detail in Los Santos and Blaine County is simply mindblowing From the bustling city streets to the serene countryside every inch of this virtual world is a visual treat

The gameplay is equally exceptional offering a seamless blend of action driving and exploration The controls are smooth and responsive ensuring an immersive experience whether youre cruising in a luxury car or engaging in highoctane shootouts

But what truly sets GTA V apart is its gripping story mode The characters are welldeveloped and the narrative is both thrilling and thoughtprovoking The games multiple protagonists add depth and variety to the storytelling making it an unforgettable journey through the criminal underbelly of Los Santos

Moreover the online mode provides endless hours of fun The variety of activities from heists to races to freeroam shenanigans keeps players engaged for years The regular updates and new content additions by Rockstar Games ensure that the online world of GTA V remains fresh and exciting

Negative Comment

However theres one glaring issue that continues to plague GTA V on PC and thats the rampant presence of modders in the online community While modding can enhance the singleplayer experience and lead to some creative and fun gameplay additions its become a doubleedged sword in the online realm

The presence of malicious modders who disrupt the game spawn impossibletodefeat enemies or harass honest players is a significant drawback It creates a hostile environment that can make online play frustrating and unpleasant for many players The lack of effective anticheat measures has allowed this problem to persist and its disheartening to see that Rockstar hasnt addressed it adequately

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V on PC is an incredible game that excels in graphics gameplay and story mode However the persistent issue with modders in the online community casts a shadow over an otherwise fantastic gaming experience making it challenging for honest players to enjoy the game to its fullest Rockstar Games should take stronger measures to curb this problem and ensure a more enjoyable online experience for all players"
the game has been such a good experience and i do recommend it to others

very fun
Campaign wasnt for me but the online is really fun
fun but still waiting for gta 6
"This game is excellent 

Unfortunately Rockstar loves forcing you to to launch their launcher through Steam so you can launch the game from there as opposed to just launching the game straight from Steam in the first place Not only that but on launch you are fucking FORCED to link your Steam account to Rockstars shitty Social Club service
Instead of buying this game on Steam I would propose that you obtain the game secondhand or pirate it 

Rockstar doesnt deserve your money"
crazy fun i love driving the cars
Fun I guess
the game is cool and can do whatever you want and no bugs

 Plays lot like San Andreas but its more polished and its silly but funny story follows wannaberetired bank robber who runs into CJ 20 and his screw ups bring back upon him Shaw I mean Trevor the even more insane redneck hunter and cause of most hillarious and disturbing moments
CAUTION Game requires crappy launcher and linking it with Steam beside regular annoying EULA
then it has old flaws like cars suddenly switching lanes or disapearing out of existence right behind you also F Amandas red car which game forces upon you"

"I got this game when I was 13 and completely nolifed it through my teenage years

I think its a great game with an underappreciated story a great soundtrack and a shitton of replayabillity
It plays smooth as silk

GTA Online is great but not without huge flaws
A majority of my time played was in GTA online Its a great sandbox with a lot of worthwhile content to play especially with friends But holy hell it lost its soul over the years Theres a lot of tedium a lot of paywalls and little to no balancing in the PvP or ingame economy not to mention the modding problem on PC Theres still a lot to enjoy but your experience may vary depending on what you value and your patience"
"Buy it for the Single Player

Do not touch the Multiplayer

I would give it a thumbs up BUT modders can kill you even if you mind your own business in Single Player

I HATE Rockstar for how easily they let modding scum run rampant GTA 6 wont be different form this"
nicee
bad game
"If youre getting GTA 5 for the love of god get it for the story mode enjoy that and then ignore online unless youre playing via something like FiveM Base GTA Online is one of the worst experiences that forces you to either pay or grind for hours to get one car that looks kinda cool Developers upping the Cayo Perico heist cooldown when done solo really did online in for me personally Raising cooldowns on solo efficient grinding methods while showing ads for the micro transactions in the hour long loading screen is a complete joke I have more fun in Red Dead Online and Rockstar does not care about RDO at all 

GTA Online is infected with so many levels of irony poisoning that Rockstar isnt even sure if theyre parodying themselves or not anymore

Besides that fantastic story mode with admittedly repetitive gameplay in most missions Heists Threes Company and the missions like those are a nice break from the formula of Drive here kill a bunch of guys drive again kill again done that the series has faced criticism for The real focal point is the story but Im sure you knew that already

Story mode 910

"Fun game lots to do online and story mode The story is fun and all but I love playing online however whenever you try to do an online missionheist you get people that AFK leave halfway through or no one joins at all
Not really a Rockstar problem but it is annoying Other than that I highly recommend this game to everyone I also recommend checking out the other games like vice city San Andreas gta 3 and 4 People coming from any of those games will love this game"
good
realy fun with mods
As long as I love GTA5 the game has changed the direction where it was All we have now is a greedy game that wants us to spend more money on The Cayo Pericos profit is shrunk down significantly from earning a 15mil to bare 1mil is UNACCEPTTABLE The game is already greedy enough to us spend more money to buy cars planes etc now they shrunk down the profit for some reason I dont get it
THIS GAME HAS EVERYTHING

good game better with mods
They Blowded up Kokatska no caya parco

the online mode for this game is probably the worst multiplayer game of all time not because its just sheer awfulness but because theres enough good stuff there to make you think maybe this could be good under a specific set of circumstances you keep chasing but said circumstances never come one of the worst gaming communities ive ever had the displeasure of playing with and still a buggy mess ten years later despite belonging to a company worth 22 billion dollars that cant even stop modders from ruining their shitty game and i still fucking play it dont touch the online mode dont look at any content for it just play the story mode
love this game
it good
nice
trash
Legendary game
Nice Game
You have to try it to see for yourself
wow UN JOC
Loved the single player much more than the online
fun when modding but other than that its still great but eh i mean its been ten years what do you expect
The Vanilla Unicorn is not an ice cream shop
"Even 8 years later this game is easily one of the best that you can buy

Whilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I dont like  and wouldnt really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage  I cant ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities  theres something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make them money whilst theyre at it

Single Player is also undeniably a brilliant experience Even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story theres really no excuse for not playing it through at least once

A lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since its original release but from an objective point of view even if this game released for the very first time this year it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away

The driving is much easier than GTA 4 literally anyone can be a decent driver in GTA 5 unless you have brain damage but I guess it makes it more accessible lol Shooting is also much improved and is high quality and those two elements combined with many others including but not limited to the excellent map make this game a perfect sandbox"
love it

"First off the game is great in fact its amazing Everyone knows that  

I cant recommend this game though because of the awful Social Club and equally awful Rockstar Games Services DRM BS you have to deal with  

Played this game fine a few years ago  I go back to play it and it turns out the email I used to set up Social Club is one I no longer have access to  Therefore I cant login and cant play the game Period 

Ive been in contact with Rockstar support for a week and still havent resolved the issue  Ive gone back and forth with them five or six times and every time they want some other proof I bought the damn game Ive sent them four or five screenshots of receipts Steam ID bla bla bla and its never enough  Its ridiculous  Now even though I have a current Social Club account with an email I can actually access they need a THIRD email to use to update my account  WTF  Forget it Im sick of it  I even bought a physical copy off of Ebay to try and get around this issue  No go Physical copy makes no difference  Unless I continue to jump through their hoops I will never be able to play GTAV again on PC  Seriously you guys made tons of money off this game whats the deal with the draconian DRM

Im old enough to remember when you bought a game on PC it came in a nice box with a nice manual and maybe even some bonus items with an actual CD or GASP floppy disk that contained the entire game and it was yours to keep and play forever  Now for your money you get a digital copy thats DRM protected to a ridiculous degree that you cant play if you want to try and change something as simple as your email  Crap like this is why gaming just isnt as fun as it used to be  Those days are gone greed has completely taken over the industry when it comes to AAA games such as this  Loved the GTA series up until this point but this is so stupid guys Im out on GTA6 not that it makes any damn difference"
this thing is way too good
LIKE IT

"Ive been playing GTA V since its initial release on the Xbox 360 back in 2013 Obviously it wasnt a consistent play time it was off and on Today I received an email stating my account has been suspended for 30 days an my character reset I figured it was a bad attempt at a phishing email so I brushed it off As the day progressed I thought about that email more and more and gave in I loaded up GTA and got into story without any issuesas it should then proceeded to try to join online Right then it hit me Suspended for 30 days and character reset

Since cheating had come to online play I have exclusively played in invite only sessions to avoid the chance of running into someone who would throw money at me Did this make the game slightly more difficult Yes but was worth not having to worry about cheaters

I went to open a ticket to just try to find out what would justify the suspensionreset but I am unable to even do that since you cant dispute the issue GTA you were once a game that I loved and enjoyed playing but this is the end for me Ill patiently wait for GTA VI to release It was a good run"

violence and sex yes
hi
Definetely a Game
I mean if you get through all the greifers and the bad moders Id say its pretty good and thier are also good moders that can give you free money
best game ever created especially with mods
I am now bankrupt after spending 873649 in sharkcards 1010
Probably the worst game to ever come out singlehandedly ruined the gaming industry
Rockstar account has been hacked twice costing me multiple games each time I cannot even play my games offline although they have single player modes Garbage 3rd party launchers need to end I would go as far as to say that rockstars launcher is the worst of them all Even though this is one of my favorite games their launcher is wildly unsafe and unsecure I received no notification of any kind that my email had been changed Since the account associated with my steam account is tied to the one rockstar account it seems I am stuck without the games I have purchased
best game
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
real life simulator
I like the part where theirs cars
"The single player is very good and was a lot of fun
Online was fun but they keep making it worse The Cayo heist was the best for solo players so what does rockstar do Quadruple the setup costs and reduce the payout by about 33 Now instead of having a way to make a solid 1 mil youre only able to get about half that Thank you rockstar please just let 5 die and focus on 6"

The graphics an speed is just as if your playing on a system
rockstar instead of making GTA 6 lets nerf 5s heists and remove cars so we can force our players to buy our premium subscription dogshit company that doesnt deserve your money
This game does not have enough achievements I didnt even play 9000 hours yet
The single player is fine but the multiplayer is literally worthless unless you have friends to play with or the patience of a saint Youd have more fun working overtime honestly
very fun
Even tho it was hard to self teach myself how to work the pc gta5 I love it

One of the best games ever to be created and played in the history of gaming
This Game Is Really Crack
"Welcome to Los Santos the city where every traffic jam is an opportunity and every pedestrian is a potential punchline Grand Theft Auto V is not just a game its a chaotic carnival of crime where the rules are made to be broken and the laughs come faster than you can steal a sports car

Lets talk about the main characters Michael Trevor and Franklin These guys are like the Three Stooges of the criminal underworld with a little less slapstick and a lot more firepower Michaels midlife crisis is a comedy goldmine Trevor is a walking talking wrecking ball of insanity and Franklin is the guy trying to keep it all together while wondering how he ended up in this circus

Now the city itself is your playground and the possibilities are endless You can rob a bank fly a plane drive a tank or just play a round of golf with the same enthusiasm and incompetence as a toddler in a candy store And if youre feeling particularly artistic you can create your own chaos masterpiece starring you as the criminal Picasso of Los Santos

The radio stations are pure gold with DJs and talk show hosts that are funnier than most standup comedians Youll find yourself driving aimlessly just to hear the next ridiculous radio skit or catchy tune And dont even get me started on the ingame internet Its like a parody of the real thing complete with hilarious ads and social media that makes you question the sanity of the virtual world

But its not all fun and games in Los Santos The police are like an overzealous neighborhood watch on steroids One minor fender bender and suddenly youve got a 5star wanted level and half the citys police force chasing you down Its like the worlds worst game of tag and youre it for life

And lets not forget the pedestrians Theyre like a walking talking sitcom cast Theyll insult you make inappropriate comments and sometimes even try to fight you Its like being in a neverending episode of a reality TV show where everyones competing for the title of Most Outrageous Citizen of Los Santos

In conclusion GTA 5 is a wild openworld sandbox where crime and comedy collide in a spectacularly entertaining fashion Its a game that lets you live out your wildest criminal fantasies while laughing at the sheer absurdity of it all So grab your controller steal a car and get ready for a rollercoaster ride through the hilarious and chaotic world of Grand Theft Auto V"

"Продолжим нашу экзикуцию
Я ставлю игре средний бал еслиб стим позволял поставил бы и визуально
Начнем с минусов в сравнении с прошлой игрой серии гта 4 многое поменялось поехали
Зачем нам рпг за пазухой в которой соседствует ещё 3 волыны карабины и 3 пулемета и попутно 9 пистолетов хрен его знает Физика машин о да в гта 4 было приятно мять машины но машины просто могли взорватся и все в гта 5 немного порадовало что можно пробить бензобак или начнет капать масло и движок заглохнет но как можно было так ухудшить управление машин и повреждения Карта игры в гта 4 явно видны черты треугольника из гта 3 к примеру аэропорт хоть и переехал немного но все же  города похожи с той разницей что в игре прошло 7 лет от гта 3 до гта 4 но тоже странно но ладно Гта са события идут в 1992 году в гта 5 2013 21 год разницы событий у игры как за 21 год у Лос Сантоса появилось  10 высоток в центре города город стал как лабиринт выросла огромная хер знает откуда загорадная местность которая даже в Гта Сан не было и самое главное куда пропали соседние города СанФиерро и ЛасВентурас
Онлайн режим это вообще чтото с чемто как можно было сделать так что 90 игроков в МУЛЬТИПЛЕЕРНОЙ ИГРЕ РАЗБЕГАЮТСЯ ПО ОДНОМУ В ЗАКРЫТЫЕ СЕССИИ В МУЛЬТИПЛЕЕРЕ а я скажу почему слишком много читеров был бы у рокстар нормальные сервера и бан по железу может их бы и не было но все же роки делают миссии которые были только кооператив уже в соло гениально же да Или вот идешь ты продавать там товар какойто игра тебе говорит получишь по 5к за каждого человека в сессии дополнительно за продажу а в сессии толкучка из 30 человек Последние обновления сделаны из готовых ассетов игры потомучто добавлять чтото новое игра уже не вывозит и они успешно вырезали из игры про автоугон 17 машин и мотоциклов из списков на сайтах за то яхту которая никому не всралась и чисто понтанутся они оставили
Достижение вообще не о чем умудрились сделать их вообще не интересными в получении а наоборот жопоразрывающим и скучным занятием по поиску 30 кусков подлодки ядерки и тд

Мой вердикт таков что я не рекомендую покупать гта 5 в 2023 году купите лучше чтото другое например рдр2 или там Atomic Heart Sabnautica Below Zero Я бы не покупал игру но мне её подарили Кто думает что я забыл про графу Плюсы игры мой вам ответ а в чем радость игра в заезжаное говно 2013 года которое как лагало на дате выхода так до сих пор и лагает но чуточку меньше в чем радость хавать говно под видом что тебе это нравится Мне это все не сильно нравится

Я закончу пожалуй на этом свой трактат"

"Its unfortunate there is yet to be another game as ambitious as this one A game that could rival the decade old GTA V in scope a game that could be owned and operated by a competent company that actually cares about the state of their project and the satisfaction of the community 

Its a travesty that GTA V is the only game in its class because Rockstar sucks Ill never understand how Ive amassed over a thousand hours on this shitshow of a game that progressively gets worse in an infinite loop of one step forward two steps back Its clear that Rockstar wants to push the game in a FOMO direction and theyre not subtle about it in any way They removed the ability to purchase hundreds of vehicles that had been added over time and they now dripfeed a handful of them every week The GTA battlepass shlock theyre pushing on consoles is only further indicative of this direction They want to incentivize players to pay exuberant prices for ingame content instead of providing more viable means of earning currency ingame As I write this Rockstar is allegedly planning to nerf the BEST way to make money in the game on the basis of wanting to provide players with greater incentives to experience the full range of content available Why not just make EVERYTHING to be a viable source of income Why not increase the payouts of adversary modes and content missions why not make outdated businesses with poor payouts like ImportExport actually viable Because at the end of the day Rockstars main goal is to make money They dont care about encouraging variety in their gameplay They want players to give up the grind and give in to microtransactions Its too bad that the GTA community doesnt have the same solidarity and willpower as other communitiesIm looking at you War Thunder Perhaps if the community created enough of an uproar things would change for the better 

But even if we ignore the blatant greed of Rockstar and the way they have gradually fucked over the economy of the game the state of GTA Online on PC is sad Rockstar has almost entirely neglected the game Everyone knows about the modders Theyre not that big a deal apart from the ones who have the ability to crash the game for YOU specifically among other malicious exploits Ive yet to encounter but they are still a nuisance 

On top of the godmode abusers present in every lobby theres a whole set of content that PC players have been refused access tocontent entirely exclusive to current gen consoles Why No one fucking knows Rockstar is anything BUT transparent It has been over a year since the Expanded and Enhanced edition of GTA released for those platforms yet Rockstar has never once broken silence about the delayed released of the content on PC The entire lack of communication between the community and the developers is inexcusable

Ive put a lot of time into this game and I still continue to despite my grievances but its not worth it If youve yet to play GTA Online or youre considering returning heed my words Do not waste your time with this game At least not in the way I have Have fun blowing your friends up with bazookas Just try not to get caught up in the intoxicating pursuit of wealth

That said GTA Vs story isnt bad A bit dated sure but Id reckon its still worth playing"

just play five m
This game is really fun if you want something to do in it just join someones invitation to a heist or heist setup its not boring
played on console and on pc sad that online isnt crossplay pcconsole but still fun graphics and missions are fairly good and a good variety and being able to run side missions for your ceo stuff is a bonus for sure being able to customize your character and cars is a favorite and being able to go to different shops and buy a variety or things from clothes and snacks to tattoos and armor is very cool sometimes the players on online can be annoying and toxic but not too much you can do and is similar to other types of franchises as wellnot a big deal if you like all that though
the intro song is the only music ill listen to in this game
Get this for its main story ignore gta online you will hate it in the long run if you dont lose interest first If you want gta multiplayer install FiveM it makes gta 5 online look like a poorly written joke
This game ruined my life

"Online mode is fun with friends but sht in random lobbies

From start to finish the story really tells you a decent story Ive personally never seen anything special in grand theft auto aside from story missions you can steal cars and kill NPCs and play tennis or visit the club but ive never cared about any of that aside from the modding community and RP servers and such the campaign in my opinion is really the only cool thing about this
One of the bestselling games of all time for a reason I cant wait for GTA 6 to arrive
bad game never loads and is constly lagging

I am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

story good online bad
There are 2 sides to GTA V there is the story mode and there is the online or I guess you could call it hackfest My review isnt on the online portion of the game though I would have to say the game of GTA V is probably one of the most nostalgic and well crafted game mechanics out there If I were to recommend this game to anyone I would recommend to play the story This game has an amazing story to it well put together and just an all around well told story all the way up to the final missions of the game The voice acting is top tier The cast did an amazing job getting you immersed into the story you can genuinely feel the characters and their emotions I would almost say its kind of like a movie almost The game works well not very many bugs maybe a few here and there but what game doesnt This story is one to definitely remember one of the best stories to a modern day game based in todays society portrayed in a really well put way There isnt very many games based in our timeframe or our modern life mostly they are based in the future or way in the past or they are horror games For a game to feel as real as GTA V with top tier voice acting and a well put together story I would have to recommend this game for that reason alone dont play online

"h1 My GTA V Review h1
h3 Rating 4 out of 10 stolen cars h3
hrhr

h2 Graphics h2
The graphics of the game are good and even though the game was released over 10 years ago you can still enjoy them However graphics are not the most important aspect as we all know

h2 User Interface h2
The user interface is simple yet clear I have absolutely nothing to complain about in this regard

h2 Performance h2
With my PC Ive never had any issues with the game and could always play it at maximum settings However this also depends on the type of PC you have

h2 Controls h2
The controls are simple and fully customizable but they could offer more I personally miss functions like being able to lie down in combat and sometimes the weapon wheel behaves a bit strangely

h2 Story in Singleplayer  Characters h2
The story mode is decent The narrative isnt outstanding but is still interesting The three main characters are wellwritten although they can sometimes come across as cliché Nonetheless each of them has a limited background story and you understand their motivations for their individual actions Unfortunately I personally miss the ability to influence the story or at least individual missions and the option of three different endings doesnt make it any better when the path to them is absolutely linear and as a player you have no influence on the game world or anything else Ill give half a point for the singleplayer heists which offer at least two different approaches for most heists providing some variety

h2 Character Weapon and Car Customization  Modifications h2
I think its cool that you can customize tune and paint your weapons and cars as you wish both in singleplayer and multiplayer There are more options available for cars which makes sense When it comes to clothing its a bit different While you can customize your character in multiplayer and distribute outfits accordingly you cant do the same in singleplayer The outfits of the playable characters always reset unfortunately you also cant change the main vehicle of the three main characters in singleplayer

h2 Immersion h2
While the game world of GTA V initially looks lively because its filled with NPCs going about their activities it becomes clear that its not quite as dynamic as it appears NPCs sometimes behave strangely repeat the same animations when certain events occur and sometimes they dont even have a sense of orientation For instance I observed a police car ramming into my car repeatedly for about 3 minutes instead of simply going around it Its also bizarre how quickly you can accumulate wanted stars from the police and how fast they arrive respawn and seem to always know your exact location Another annoying feature in multiplayer is the calls you receive every time you enter the game These are usually 2 to 4 calls from NPCs telling you the same things You have to answer these calls each time before you can hang up

h2 City  Game World Exploration h2
The game world is large offering a variety of different areas making it feel like a realistic city and its surroundings Theres a large urban area representing a typical US city areas with a lot of nature and smaller more remote towns

h2 Music h2
The music in the missions is okay but nothing special What I find fantastic however is the selection of radio stations theres something for every musical taste and if someone cant find anything they like theres the feature to add your own music Simply fantastic

h2 Gameplay  Missions in Online Mode h2
After about 10 years the online mode is a joke Initially when I bought the game I liked it because of the many options for character customization apartments garages and the open world to explore and complete missions Unfortunately the game at least for me quickly became boring because the missions are often the same or similar making it less enjoyable

h2 New Content  Updates h2
Over the years some content has been added to the multiplayer not always good content while the singleplayer was left empty New cars and weapons were never implemented in the singleplayer probably because they couldnt make additional money from it

h2 Online Balancing  Pay to Win h2
In multiplayer there are sometimes ridiculously overpowered weapons and cars that throw the games balance out the window These items as well as some clothing and cars are so expensive that its tedious to earn them ingame But luckily you have the option to buy Shark Cards ingame currency with real money Sarcasm This way you can have the perfect combination of overpriced ingame items that paytowin players can easily acquire if theyre willing to invest their hardearned money into an online game

h2 Apartments  Garages h2
When I saw that it was possible to buy apartments and garages at the beginning I was excited and saved up until I could afford one Unfortunately the disappointment was greater than I expected from the cheapest to the most expensive they have very few functions except for being chosen as spawn points and some having a garage for cars You can interact with some things like drinking smoothies watching TV or getting your character so drunk that they pass out While garages still serve a purpose apartments are pretty much useless unless you want to plan heists Youre better off investing your extra money in a good armored car or weapons

h2 Cheaters  Modding h2
I could maybe overlook these other issues if GTA Online could finally deal with the wave of cheaters The problem existed years ago and it still exists today Players who play normally get banned partly because of cheaters who might shower you with a ton of money in a short time resulting in an automatic ban while players who obviously cheat using explosive ammunition becoming invincible teleporting or blatantly spawning cars whales or Ferris wheels dont get banned or it takes forever Today was the first time in a while that I played GTA V and when I entered multiplayer it was hard to find a lobby without at least one cheater unless youre in a private session

h2 Replayability h2
I would play the game again for the story mode as I currently do While other games have captivated me more it always depends on personal preference and the type of games one prefers To experience different endings or have an alternative to multiplayer its worth it

h2 Summary h2
If youre interested in the story mode I can still recommend it but the multiplayer is absolutely not worth it anymore

Rating 4 out of 10 stolen cars would not recommend"

"Wanna play a game with a wild story endearing characters and a seemingly alive world

Or maybe you want to steal some old mans car play a round of golf rob a convenience store to buy some time with a working girl and drive off a cliff while she gives you a good time

If any of that seems appealing you might be insane and this game is perfect for you"
my favourite part is when michael said its grand theft time and he auto Vd all over the place
Such a great game

One of the greatest games ever made Both online and offline mods are the best in their class
Imagine 40 FPS on RTX 2070
one of the best games of the early 2010s HOWEVER the online experience is not balanced overrun with bots and griefers and simply unfun without blowing your childs college fund on shark cards
Really great game but their is map glitch in story mode fps stuck in story mode and not the problem in online
great
Cool
good
Do not buy GTA on epic games if you got it for free on there do not download it is to much of a hassal to get it up to date with the newer gen GTA versions this is why I was buy it on steam because steam is way easier to navigate over 600k games and overall better than epic games  NoT_KBTvr
just fun

great game i would recomend this to anyone in the world
GTA V used to be that one game everyone liked or everyone could play as of writing this review I havent touched this game since the merryweather update if any newer player to this series of the games Rockstar have made It isnt worth it Rockstar needs to change before its worth it i ask for players to find another game this company deserves nothing this game was my childhood and Im sad to say it no longer is Imagine call of duty releasing a game with an AK 47 based gun and a M4A1 based gun and removing both guns and putting it in a shop for console only players

"as much as i use to love this game seems GTAV is no longer playable on newer hardware at least in my case 
 i7 10700k
64gb 3600mhz ddr4 
rtx 3070
4x4 tb sata ssds
2x2 tb samsung 980 pro
samsung 1080p 144hz monitor

i should theoretically be able to run the game at max settings with no less then 100fps which would be fine but it seems in the last few updates somethings gone very wrong and i get drops and freezes every few minutes regardless of what settings i choose
ive used both the latest windows 10 and windows 11 pro took out my 3070 and swapped in a 2070s assuming maybe my gpu was at fault still hefty stuttering freezing and frame drops again regardless of settings
 ive even played the game on a i5 10600rtx 206032gb ram and still no joy 

im hoping that GTAV keeps reciveing updates and one of them fixes the issue

peace out B"

Even though Ive got 559 hours into this game I still would never recommend it It is literally plagued with hackers I mean the hacks in this game are just so easy to get and are so varied that you wont play half an hour without at least one PVPing the entire zone dropping cash thatll get everyone banned or screwing the environment so much youll eventually just log out of frustrating instance hopping The hacks get better as time goes on and the detection of the devs gets worse Most of my 500 hours were spent back before it was just a huge hackfest

"Buyer beware Do not purchase this game with the expectation that youll actually be able to play this game in public lobbies Every Single Lobby is filled with kids using Mod Menus I wont list all the stuff that they do but its constant kicking from lobby crashing your game forcing animations on your character teleporting you to random missions in the game dropping weapons on your character that are a major pain to get rid of taking control of your character when driving or doing anything removing all cars from lobby 

These mods make all the load times longer  guess what happens to the poor kids that report these blatant cheaters The mod menu notifies the mod user that a report has been sent tells them who sent the report and blocks the report from ever making it to the server So guess who starts getting harassed A young unsuspecting kid 

Online is unplayable its a horrible experience Rockstar promoting the PC version of this game as Online is nothing short of fraud There is no online there are public lobbies filled with modders Absolute dumpster fire

If you purchase this game with the intention of playing it online I assure you you will be very disappointed"
"L

edit W"
i feel successful in life playing this game
Really fun
Los angeles does not look this good in real life
Better off playing the story and role playing servers than the pure garbage of a cash grab online mode which you seriously need great internet protection from moddershackers in the online game if you dont want to end up having your internet destroyed So yeah dont play online Rockstar Games doesnt care for your opinions and your safety
"While there are Loads of great reasons to play the few that make it VERY hard to play could have been mostly fixed over the years ie The incredibly poor match making system while the game is cross platform finding a group and almost ALL missions REQUIRE 4 people the only people it will match you with are existing people in the CURRENT instance you are in mixed with a few quick job joiners Another example would be the very long load times I mean VERY long and on top of that there are a lot of times the game Fails to load session so after spending 23 hours getting a squad that is not just people trying to ruin the run Who are in no way punished for Griefing a squad even if reported nothing will get done your game will get stuck loading or give a Failed to join session error pretty frequently thus undoing your hours of work
 In short Rockstar games Could have taken the loads of money and fixed some stuff but have never done so these basic game functions failing along with other players regularly Very common using cheat codes trainers to teleport to you take your money kill you with a rocket at point blank range and teleport to the next player in the session Never being punished even when reported you will see the same people still doing the same thing Unless this is just for single player story I would never recommend this game as anything other than a waste of time"
hhhhhhh
asss game to many hacker
Played for a while and have around 400 million dollars and level 384 this game was fun because other people can play with you
i got banned for modding thats so unfair smh
the game looks like ass the ps3 version was better in every way when you go into the online part every car is limited to 60mph and you cant shoot your guns just punch also you cant use any kind of controller like a steering wheel or yolk and your psnxbox controllers arnt that responsive for some reason so if i was you id only play this dumpster fire on consoles

"Grand Theft Auto V My Second Life as a Digital Daredevil

Rating 

Grand Theft Auto V the game where Ive discovered my alter ego as a digital daredevil Move over Evel Knievel Ive got a rocketpropelled motorcycle and a thirst for mayhem

Pros

 Ive learned that in Los Santos the traffic lights are mere suggestions Green red or blue Ill drive through them all  and sometimes even the buildings
 The games pedestrians have a unique way of coping with chaos Theyll scream curse and sometimes even join me in my criminal escapades like theyve been waiting for a chance to break bad
 Ive become a fashion icon Whether Im sporting a tuxedo while robbing a bank or a Hawaiian shirt while parachuting from a helicopter Im always dressed for success
 GTA V has taught me that versatility is key One minute Im a mastermind heist planner the next Im a stuntman extraordinaire and then Im just a guy trying to play golf in the middle of a gang war

Cons

 My sense of traffic rules is a bit skewed in the real world now My passengers arent thrilled when I try to reenact my highway adventures
 My friends and I have turned every online session into a chaotic competition Who can survive the longest with a 5star wanted level Who can jump a motorcycle over the most rooftops The winner gets bragging rights but everyone else ends up in the hospital
 Ive developed a habit of looking for hidden packages in real life hoping to stumble upon a stash of cash or a shiny weapon upgrade So far no luck
 GTA V has ruined my ability to watch a movie without considering how much chaos I can cause with a helicopter in that same scenario

Grand Theft Auto V is a digital playground where you can embrace your inner outlaw explore a sprawling virtual city and create the most insane stories with friends Its the kind of game where youll start a mission but end up in a completely unrelated adventure like skydiving into a military base just for kicks

To those considering a visit to this virtual world Buckle up enjoy the madness and remember that in GTA V the only limit is your imagination and the occasional rocket launcher

In conclusion GTA V is where Ive learned that sometimes lifes best moments happen when you drive off the beaten path literally

Overall rating "
Its aged horrifically
"Dont fund Rockstar

I love the GTA series but I hate Rockstar
Rockstar aint what it used to be all the good people left and now it is one big corporate scam
Like you can see online all multiplayer services are terrible and compromised too In such manner that people like me and millions of others can see where you life with a single click You dont have to be an expert with 30 and one google search you too can be a scummy hacker

Rockstar always cuts down on their spending keeping only the worst possible solutions anti cheat if you can call it that while they knowingly scam a majority of minors with their shark cards crappy dlcs and casino tricks which get people mainly minors as the demographic show which they also have btw to return for their scummy digital currency which is absolutely worthless

Trainers are cheap and widely available dont waste your time grinding a game that is held in low to no regard by its developers

My main problem is that I can no longer play and Rockstar support which are a bunch of nobodies stuck in a office no braining responses decided that they cant solve the problem they caused but also refuse to properly read or trace back conversations that took place within 12 hours of time

The launcher was once again updated and I am now locked out Can you please login manually to an email that has 13com in it like I know a mail provider or service which provides such a strange string as email address Clearly this is generated they linked it it is their fault their responsibility and they give fck all

1 I dont know this email
2 I have not been hacked social club and steam are linked by rockstar that is the only thing that happened
3 If I cant access a rockstar generated email and they refuse to provide support which they have then I am locked out of my game which I payed for and legally should have access too

The repercussions taken here should be
1 Steam should monitor unfair and illegal actions from companies towards their client base
2 Rockstar should treat their costumers like people and not like trash or robots


Rockstar Sam Houser TakeTwo Interactive Strauss Zelnick from the deepest point in my heart fck you and everything you think you stand for I will never buy GTA 6 which was rightfully leaked because you have a team of evil dpshit devs"
i hate this game they ban me bcuz im coloured

"Grand Theft Auto V GTA V stands as a true masterpiece of openworld gaming and its not hard to see why Rockstar Games has crafted an experience that delivers on every front from its expansive open world to its captivating characters and engaging gameplay

One of GTA Vs most striking features is the sprawling beautifully detailed city of Los Santos The level of realism and attention to detail is nothing short of astonishing Whether youre cruising down the busy streets exploring the gritty neighborhoods or soaring over the stunning landscape in an aircraft the world feels alive and dynamic The diversity of environments from the urban jungle to the tranquil countryside adds to the games immersive quality

But its not just about the world its the people who inhabit it that make GTA V shine The games three protagonistsMichael Franklin and Trevorare incredibly welldeveloped and offer distinct personalities and backgrounds Their intertwining stories create a narrative thats engaging and full of memorable moments The voice acting is topnotch making these characters feel like real people with their quirks and flaws

The sheer variety of activities and missions is staggering From highoctane heists that require meticulous planning to offbeat side missions that can range from absurd to touching GTA V keeps you constantly entertained The game never forces you down a linear path allowing you to explore at your own pace and choose how you want to tackle missions"
"Has anyone encountered this issue plz help

So whenever i start my gta 5 i come in to the loading screen and as soon its loaded i come in a public session my game shuts off and i come back to steam

Please help Gta is one of my favorite games to play Plz help"
"This game fucking sucks lol

Between a billion game breaking bugs everything constantly crashing horrendous enemy balancing and some absolutely dogshit players I should not like GTA V

But good lord is it fun 

Playing this game with friends is an absolutely ridiculous stupid and fun experience In between productive segments things almost always break down into intergroup mayhem and its the funniest thing every single time No other game allows me to finish a mission with friends and then immediately send them flying crossmap with the ass end of my car 

Also just really good for putting on a podcast and keeping your hands busy for a few hours Hell that makes up about half of the hours I do have 

overall this game is not good but its fun and I can absolutely recommend it for its now miniscule price"

One of the best games of all time Hands down I have over 200 hours clocked on PSN but PC allows for custom servers and RP No other game is quite like it except RDR2 9510
"Amazing gameee It has its faults on the online mode but the story mode is absolute amazing I dont know where to starts but I can state the following I fell in love with most of the charters and the world real fast The open world is very expansive and lively The humor can be conversational to some but some of it really made me giggle The radio music is amazing peroid and I really enjoyed the plot of the story mode in general

The online mode is good but a lot of it is full of lowlife losers who use cheats and has quite a few glitches The online can be fun though and Im active on the online"

Ten years 3 consoles 3 PCs and countless nights grinding away online with some of my best friends Honestly the release of GTA VI is going to hurt a little The base game is a blast and I do recommend it but really its just been such a constant in my life at this point I kind of consider this game a friend
Fire
I love Chicken Strips
i havent finished the story mode but the online is fun until you eventually depend on running around the map everytime just to get your paycheck from the business you have been waiting days to be fully stocked up i swear to god i do not have patience to go ahead with cayo perico not to count my bad framerate

"I just modded GTAV with Manual Transmission using Logitech G923 with force shifter and WOW This mod changes everything It feels like Im actually driving as my car is being totaled by the cops force feedback 

Please Rockstar add this feature to GTAVI It is possibly the best driving simulation Ive experienced other than Asseto Corsa Just imagine playing cops and robbers with car chasing with this kinda mod"

"When you finally play GTA V 10 years after release and realize its still cooler than your exs Instagram feed

 Rollin through Los Santos like a boss

 Story 1010
GTA Vs story hooks you harder than a catfish on a fishing line Its like bingewatching the best crime drama while being the star of the show Youre in for a ride and you wont want to get off 

 Open World 1110
Los Santos is basically a character in itself Its like a living breathing city where anything can happen From highspeed chases to epic ramp jumps the possibilities are endless Youre the director of your own action movie

 Music and Visuals 910
The tunes are so fire youll feel like youre in your own music video And the visuals Its like someone poured HD sauce all over your screen You can practically smell the exhaust fumes and feel the citys pulse

 Missions and Side Missions 6910
Every mission is like a mini heist movie Explosions shootouts and more plot twists than a soap opera And the side missions Theyre like little nuggets of gold scattered throughout Los Santos Youll never run out of things to do

 Timeless Classic 1010
Playing this 10 years after release and its still as fresh as a brand new game GTA V was basically the Elon Musk of its timeway ahead of the curve Rockstar really knew what they were doing

 Overall 1010
Grand Theft Auto V isnt just a game its a cultural phenomenon A game so good it ages like fine wine If you havent played it yet what are you even doing with your life Get ready for a ride thatll leave you saying I cant believe I waited this long "
fun
its ok

"I just wanted to share with you all my experience playing GTA V Its one of the most immersive and entertaining games Ive ever played The attention to detail in the open world is incredible and the story is both compelling and engaging

I love how much freedom there is in the game  I can choose how to complete missions and what activities to engage in and theres always something new to discover The games graphics and animations are topnotch and the driving and shooting mechanics feel very smooth and satisfying

Ive also spent a ton of time exploring the vast multiplayer mode with my friends which has been an absolute blast Weve tried out all the different game modes available and have had so much fun messing around in the open world with our custom characters

As a gamer I can confidently say that GTA V is one of the best games out there right now and I would definitely recommend it to anyone reading this With its huge amount of content and incredible replayability youll find yourself coming back to GTA V time and again"
lovely game
super fun i totally recommend this game to anyone who plays any type of video games
"The Cayo Perico is nefted as fck

With biGrand Theft Auto VIib having FINALLY been announced and shown to the world I decided to go back and play through GTA V Despite some of my gripes with the main story Id be lying if I said it wasnt a damn good time as with the rest of the game Even after a decade since it released this game is still an impressive feat in every way and has stood the test of time
"its perfect but hard
its amazing but hard
its intresting but"
Its Game Mechanics And Game Story Line Is Interesting And Those Who Want Open World Feel Ill Prefer This For Them

"I didnt see hours passing by while playing this evergreen

Yay were going to see airbud
lo
if your new you have to grind hard or spend money to keep up with other legit players or friends that have played longer but all around gameplay is fun hackers attempting to compromise accounts almost every update sucks but with rockstar recently supporting the server host of FIVEM and such itll likely be countered alot sooner as before i hope i hope they give the people who actually wanna work on the game enough power to do so basically
good bussin
Great fucking game played it multiple times on other account The offline mode is great but the onlyne mode is even better I hope gta6 will come out soon
Over 50k people playing at any point during the day yet I cant find 3 people to complete a Heist Lovely 11 out of 10 Cant wait for GTA VI D

Its a good game Great if your a grinder or just a casual looking for some laughs with your friends

this game is one of the best open word games if ever playd its the best of the best 1010
Ive played GTA5 a LOT  Its fun  Story is great and challenging Online play can be a lot of fun with friends but there are a LOT of other players that just ruin it  Hacking is a major problem that rockstar wont do anything about  Nothin is more frustrating than trying to do an open session story mission then having some invincible prick teleport next to you and blow up you and your objective just for you to have to start it all over again  There is a work around that get you into and empty session which is great if you are going about it all solo but its not a great work around if you are trying to play with friends  I think only the delivery missions cant be done in a private crew friends or invite only session so that helps a little

"This port of the game really has trouble on PC especially with newer hardware like RTX 3060 and I710 I have gone through a bunch of videos and websites explaining how to prevent the countless crashing I experienced which unfortunately seems pretty common I changed  updated everything that was talked about on the computer and in game I even downloaded FPS optimization packs that are reported to help with the initialization error crashes There were two types of crashes Initialization errors that are tied to the graphics cards reportedly and full crashes without error that just sent me back to steam 

I powered my way through the campaign and lost track of the fixes that I had to do that were overall unsuccessful I am now uninstalling the game and not touching it again I find it frustrating and disappointing that such a popular game has such a bad PC port and that it is up to the community to try and fix and optimize the game I mean Rockstar are the same people that charge 50 for a red dead 1 port when recent full remakes of games have been an average of 40 Why should I expect for them to manage one of their biggest sources of profit when the fans are doing it for them"

Absolute garbage Ive done basically everything to try to get this game running normally to even launch but nothing happens Stuck on a loading screen for literal days while nothing happens this game is garbage and even Rockstar customer support cant figure out why the game wont launch for me Dont install this game unless you want a useless piece of bloatware to take up space on your PC
One of the greatest masterpiece ever created
is aight
Ive played the game before for around 300 hours on Epic but it glitched out so I had to create a new account on Steam Either way the game is quite good just the money making techniques are very tedious That is if you want to make any actual money above 100k

"Grand Theft Auto V GTA V is nothing short of a gaming phenomenon and its easy to see why Rockstar Games has crafted an openworld masterpiece that continues to captivate players worldwide Heres why I cant stop praising this game

First and foremost the openworld of Los Santos is an absolute marvel Its vast diverse and teeming with life From the bustling streets of downtown to the serene beauty of Blaine Countys wilderness every inch of this world feels meticulously designed and alive Whether youre driving like a maniac flying high above the city or exploring off the beaten path theres always something exciting to discover

The story is another highlight With three playable protagonists each with their own unique personality and motivations GTA V offers a narrative experience unlike any other in the series The characters are brilliantly written and the voice acting is topnotch bringing them to life in a way that makes you genuinely care about their fates The heists in particular are thrilling and masterfully executed providing some of the most memorable moments in gaming

The freedom GTA V offers is staggering You can choose to follow the main story embark on countless side missions or simply wreak havoc in the city The variety of activities is mindboggling from adrenalinepumping car chases to leisurely rounds of golf The sense of immersion is unparalleled thanks to the attention to detail in every aspect of the game

Speaking of detail the graphics are a testament to Rockstars dedication to creating a visually stunning experience Even years after its initial release GTA V continues to impress with its realistic lighting weather effects and meticulously crafted environments Its a game that looks and feels ahead of its time

GTA Online adds even more longevity to this already massive game The multiplayer mode allows you to create your own criminal empire participate in heists with friends and engage in a wide range of activities in the everexpanding online world of Los Santos The constant updates and additions from Rockstar keep the online experience fresh and exciting

The soundtrack is legendary featuring a diverse range of music across various radio stations Whether youre into classic rock hiphop or electronic beats youll find something that suits your taste enhancing the atmosphere of the game

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a triumph of openworld game design storytelling and sheer fun Its a game that continues to evolve and impress even years after its release If you havent experienced the chaos thrills and adventure of Los Santos theres no better time than now Jump into this virtual playground and get ready for a wild unforgettable ride"

"Grand Theft Auto V More like Grind Fest Auto V

Okay Id be lying if I said I havent been enjoying the new content thats been added since the last time I played GTA Online 5 years ago but the sheer amount of grinding you have to do to buy anything due to everything being priced ridiculously high now is insane Like you need to have a ton of money before you can a buy a business so can make enough money to be able to afford to buy stuff Also no fun to be had in public lobbies as theyre still plagued by griefers so Ive only been playing in invite only lobbies essentially playing GTA Online as a single player game If youre thinking about buying the game in 2023 and starting from rank 1 in Online dont bother 

Obviously this is a review of GTA Online I dont think anyone is buying GTA V for the single player story anymore"

GOD TEIR GAME
"REASONS WHY GTA V IS NOT FUN

NO 1 MANGOTHEORY
Mangotheory is a bot that happens to join the lobby and ruin the experience for everyone When it joins the avatar stand still as if AFK with godmode allowing it to be uninterrupted with respawning and starts to promote their MONEYXP and Unlock glitches in the public chat they then promote their discord channel for you to join to acquire cheats This has been confirmed to be a bot by many players Ive spoken to in the chat 

NO 2 Real Cheaters
Unlike Mangotheory a bot you can encounter many real people who have found a way to bring a cheat engine into the public lobbies These players have many abilities to screw over the players in the game
Ability 1 Godmode 
Godmode make the player impossible to kill giving them the advantage to follow you around and kill your avatar anytime they feel like it making it impossible to have fun with others who a trying to enjoy the game
Ability 2 Teleportation 
Teleportation remove the need to chase down another player when trolling Everytime Ive tried to escape a cheater would just teleport right next to me and kill me This Teleportation cheats is so bad that it even allows cheaters to enter a your apartment ingame meaning that even the safe zones arent protected
Ability 3 Messing with your Avatar 
Ive only played this game for a short time but have already lost count of the amount of times my character has been killed out of the blue without any warning Cheaters can essentially nuke a public lobby killing all present players simultaneously which would just lead to an argument in the chat one time i ran into a cheater that made everyone in the lobby slowly levitate into the sky and then dropping us to our deaths and even after respawning you would go back to levitating forcing everyone to leave and join another lobby
Ability 4 Server Wide Kicking 
When a cheater happen to get in an argument with an actual player it always ends with the cheater kicking everyone from the public lobby and sending us to a solo lobby which makes the player having to go through the hassle of joining another public lobby to interact with players again
Ability 5 Messing with level and money
Within my first 10 minutes of playing GTA V Online i was learning all the basics of what i can do and how to do it Tutorial When i was given the chance to finally free roam the GTA V world and do as i please my screen was filled with notifications saying Ive collected 1010 collectablesecrat cash This gave my player 1M of ingame currency and my level jumped from 130 in an instant allowing me to unlock the achievement  reach rank 25 When i had a look at the chat it was one cheater saying your welcome and then leaving the game after promoting where and how to get the hacks This took away the fun for grinding for money and items if they were this easy to obtain with cheats 

NO 3 Public Lobbies
When i bought GTA V i was expecting to run into a couple of bad apples or sweats who player the game seriously mixed in with a couple of nice players who would make it fun but in order to have any fun with the online aspect of GTA V you would have to either play with friends on in a crew only session or find any discord servers which promotes a private server to join without cheaters

NO 4 AntiCheat
This is my first time playing GTA V online and Ive never experienced a game with a terrible anticheat system Until  I see that Rockstar has introduced and implemented a functional anticheat system

Thanks for your cooperation

4  A good game
5  Just play and be happy "
Game is fun until any form of modder comes on the server modders are actual dog shit players who cant play the game correctly so they have to cheat just to beat you And the best part is is rockstar doesnt actually give a flying fuck about what happens online Every time I report these little bitches and send hard evidence of them modding they dont do jack shit
perfect
GTA Online is a delivery driving simulator with tons of hackers so dont play online The real gold lies in the story mode Story mode is the ideal way to play this game 
"GTA 5 is the new Skyrim


ite been around for a decade and always lost reputation over the years

stop milking this game it will never get better unless you readd everything who was removed  abbility to transfer money to other players manual ragdoll kill yourself anywhere you want  removed because of try hards doing 1st person 180 su1cide to never die from a player   readd animals colored online map like xbox 360ps3 online used to have etc 


dont be like Bethesdabe like the FiveM community and actually put some love in it instead of greed







this final message goes for any company owner  or future owner  who read this


taking shortcuts always help financiallyhowever its never as good as it used to be or could have been if it stayed in its original formmany disasters and companys fall come from taking shortcutsbe wise in where you take those shortcutsbecause sometimes a better option is only a tiny bit harder to achieve but has a better outcomestop thinking about your wallet first think about whoever will fill it in returnthe merrier the betterthe more your clients hate your work the less they will invest and the more likely they will prevent potential customers from making purchasesin the end a happy customer brings an other

"Rockstars Grand Theft Auto V is a massive openworld action game that offers an incredible amount of freedom to explore the vast city of Los Santos and surrounding countryside After its initial release in 2013 it still holds up well nearly a decade later as one of the most ambitious and entertaining open world games ever created

GTA V allows you to play as three different protagonists  Michael Franklin and Trevor Each character has their own skillsets and special abilities and you can switch between them at will This gives you a lot of strategic options during missions and allows you to see the story from different perspectives

The sprawling open world is packed with details that make Los Santos feel like a living breathing city There are countless vehicles to drive stunt jumps to make random events to discover and side activities like tennis golf and scuba diving The amount of content is almost overwhelming

Missions provide plenty of overthetop action from large scale heists to street races and shootouts Gunplay feels impactful and driving mechanics are smooth Even mundane activities like customizing cars is enjoyable thanks to the level of depth and options

With amazing writing voice acting and character development GTA Vs story and satire of Southern California life is entertaining from start to finish Though some themes and humor havent aged perfectly its an engaging crime story fueled by greed and a memorable cast of characters

GTA Online has kept the experience feeling fresh for years with new modes and content updates It does have some repetitive grind but playing and wreaking havoc with friends is a total blast

Some gameplay and graphics elements feel a bit dated now but GTA V remains one of the most impressive open world experiences out there The incredible attention to detail paired with exciting action and dark humor makes this a crime saga not to be missed"

"Well as a fan of GTA games I can say that GTA V is a good game But the game has four cons for me 
 
Firstly I dont like the story of the game The story of the game is so boring unlike other GTA games    
 
Second con is about online There are many toxic players Of course many online games have some toxic players If you want to earn some cash to play normal I recommend you to play in private session And if you want to enjoy online you need to have friends to play online with them GTA Online missions are good can say that better than the story missions
 
Third con is about chatting system in online Sometimes you can see your friends chat sometimes cant 
 
Fourth con is about online again Well there were some guns cars in the game but then Rockstar removed them from the game thats why I think that older players have more advantage about that things which I mentioned

Edit Rockstar fixed third and fourth problems Well done"

GTA 5 is a very good game but to much greifing
yes
best game ever
It is the 10 year reunion of this game and I know it has won the labor of love award here on steam but I feel an obligation to thank the game for its graphics gameplay and comradeship I have gain with my 250 friends  I have more that 2000 hours in game and more than what is charted here on steam  Well worth the almost 30 for the game play alone  Yes you start small with a small weapons selection but if you put the time in get to level 120ish all weapons become available  Bravo Zulu to all the people who made this game into something that will last into at least 1 future generation after absorbing 2 already
The game is enjoyable and great for immersing yourself in a new world I quite enjoy the driving side of the game as it is realistic in the sense of how the cars function look and crash Not only that both in the online mode and story mode there are endless missions to complete that will certainly occupy you for hours on end I highly recommend this game to new players
The best game Ive ever played

Playing GTA 5 is like trying to plan a quiet peaceful day at the beach with your ingame buddies only to end up hijacking a jet ski crashing it into a yacht and making more enemies than friends Its like life on the edge of chaos where the most logical thing to do after robbing a bank is to go play some golf and practice your swing Remember in Los Santos youre only one stolen ice cream truck away from becoming a criminal mastermind

My name is Walter Hartwell White I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque New Mexico 87104 This is my confession If youre watching this tape Im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw Hank Schrader Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist Shortly after my 50th birthday he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA I was astounded I I always thought Hank was a very moral man and I was particularly vulnerable at the time  something he knew and took advantage of I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family Hank took me in on a ridealong and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make And I was weak I didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed Hank had a partner a businessman named Gustavo Fring Hank sold me into servitude to this man And when I tried to quit Fring threatened my family I didnt know where to turn Eventually Hank and Fring had a fallingout Things escalated Fring was able to arrange  uh I guess I guess you call it a hit  on Hank and failed but Hank was seriously injured And I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over 177000 Upon recovery Hank was bent on revenge Working with a man named Hector Salamanca he plotted to kill Fring The bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it I have often contemplated suicide but Im a coward I wanted to go to the police but I was frightened Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA To keep me in line he took my children For three months he kept them My wife had no idea of my criminal activities and was horrified to learn what I had done I was in hell I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family Recently I tried once again to quit and in response he gave me this Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in Blood Money I cant take this anymore I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me or worse hurt my family All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is

"online is only fun if you have a menu and the story mode is really fun 

also do not buy shark cards just pay some dude online to give you 10 billion for like 10 dollars if you really want to buy money"
good just dont go to stript club
DX_Version value0 
very yes game spent most of the time in the strip
Top 3 game of all time Rockstar takes longer than Playboi Carti to make us games but theyre worth it every single time Open world story mode is magnificent and heists are rewarding and fun every time you do one 1110
"Game for one time when comes to single playeronline garbage Cheaters in all games this days I really hate that
Greedy companymade masterpiece like RDR2 online not that good and then back to bs"
online is filled with hackers prepare to get DDOSd rockstar just wants your money dont do it
goood

waiting for GTA VI

"Do not play online play on fivem instead if you plan on playing online rockstar doesnt care to add anti cheat even though its the most known issue in their games that cheaters run freely and ruin everything

Singleplayer though a sandbox openworld where your imagination of what chaos you can bring to the world is the limit 810 and the story isnt too bad either

i give the game a 610 mainly due to the base game online being in such a horrible state for so long with no effort to fix it from rockstar Lets just hope gta 6 will have at minimum Easy Anticheat active"
nice story

"Bro Stop Already I got the preorder edition in 2013 and this game died at the introduction of flying vehicles With over 8000 hours across 3 platforms I can confidently say this game is dead Any online lobby is god mode hackers while innocent people get banned for in game currency Sam  Dan Houser were the soul of this company and shortly after they left we all saw in front of our eyes their transformation into Rockisoft We can all agree how underwhelming and outright lazy the RDR1 port was Any good titles like RDR2 Online get shut down to focus on a 12 decade old dying game all in the name of  good old R milking their fans relentlessly Hello Games  Facepunch are the some of the only major devs rn that actually care about their game and treat their players like playerss instead of money bags Buying everyting in GTA Online costs about 900 Million ingame  which is roughly 9000 USD or 2 YEARS of playtime  

TLDR

 DEAD GAME
 Rockisoft is not the same after losing Sam  Dan Houser
 Absolutely despise their fanbase and transformed into sellouts GTA SA remastered RDR2 Online
 Completely oblivious to Fanbase wants RDR1 port Bully 2 La Noire

Do not reply its T2Interactive because as a lead of a 1B franchise team you do have some say"

GOOFY AHH GAME WITH HACKER AND TITS WWWWWWWWWW GAME FRFR ON MY MAMAS TOE
shot a taxi driver
the steam version of this game is basic and is not as evolved as the console versions because everyone who does play mods and the normal game is still in the caveman days from what I have experienced the PS5 version of gta online has more to do custom glitched benny rims on any caryankton platesglitched paint colorscartradeglitchesModded vehicles you can put in your garage you normally cannot own all while having no mods this is all done in the normal gta online version tons more stuff to do on the consoel version of this game but the campaign was great everything done so well game runs smooth apartmentsgunsjobsheistscarsclothesinsurance quite a bit to the game wish there was more to it the fivem launcher has really taken over the base game due to the base game being so limited on content not much has been added over the 10 years but a couple mmos and a couple jobs looking forward to the new one
VD
its like they added a shitton of online missions without ever balancing them modders in every other server overall sht game
I highly enjoy running pedestrians over in this game with my vehicle then proceeding to go on a 5star flee from the Law Enforcement Officers with a big smile on my face My mental state stat in this video game is labelled as psychopath  which is not too far from myself in real life I enjoy and feel connected this game Would reccomend steamhappy
Pretty solid Large player base
Ive had so much fun and met so many people while playing this game not to mention all of the content there is its practically endless If any new player read this and decide to get the game I have a few tips dont buy a lowmid end apartment buy a high end one but dont get expensive ones You can get one for 200k which might seem like a lot but you can make that back from the original heists Also buy the diamond casino membership ingame it allows you to spin a wheel every 24 hours and get a prize whether that be money Xp or a car In total Ive had so much fun in this game and will continue to play it untill gta 6 comes out around marchapril 2024

"Since Rockstar has made it impossible for me to get in touch with them privately Ill post this on every public forum until they respond

In regard to your previous email

Dearest Rockstar Games

I hope this email finds you well This is a response to the pleasant email you sent me 2 days ago in regards to my suspension Now this is not an appeal this is not me begging to lift my suspension This is going to be a me an innocent bystander flipping your entire organization from CEO Strauss Zelnick to the janitor whose name I hope is Joey the biggest of middle fingers I have not played GTA V since June 22nd 2023 or the day they discovered the OceanGate Titan wreckage Now I know the suspension is not from the subnautical nonsense I may have or may have not partaken in the day the wreckage was discovered because that would just be silly now would it I do not know the details as to why I have been suspended and my progress reset for at this portion of our debacle is an unknown allegation During a brief investigation into what could possibly warrant my suspension unless my account was hacked there is no need for the suspension I do not believe my suspension is just and warranted for outside tomfoolery This may come as a shock to you but as I investigate these bold allegations I will be placing you on an unpaid indefinite suspension from my valuable time I also regret to inform you that this a final decision and cannot be appealed I will also tell 2 friends of how poorly you handled this situation They will in turn tell 2 friend who each will tell 2 friends If that chain continues it will be a very bad and sad look for Rockstar games I hope that this misunderstanding can be handled like gentlemenladiestheythem

Recently Ive been playing GTA IV and while it feels slightly dated with some mission designs it just feels built to last better than this multibillion dollar buncha garbage If I were to give my suggestion Dont get this game again even if you want to play it Take it from a person who has less than half a thousand hours the most fun youll have about GTA V is watching people play it not doing so yourself R doesnt need you to buy more GTA V milk so dont"

"Amazing singleplayer experience with an awesome open world the best driving in any game Ive played to the point where I drive and listen to music just for fun without doing anything else for hours and the online is a mixed bag that using the right methods and sometimes with a friend or two is still extremely fun despite the grind  or because of the grind if you like that like I do

Solid 810 game one of my favs"
Wow such a nice game 3 The anti cheat for this game is phenomenal and the community is so good they give you compliments in the chat and they are real race enthusiasts when you load in you can guarantee there will be at least 2 administrators in god mode in every session
cloud sync disconnects way to much and it takes forever to load into a online server even with fast 5g wifi
it was perfectperfect down to every last minute detail

"GTA Online is worst experience ever The game is full of cheaters who can do whatever they want to you take your weapons money surround you with invisible walls kill you right at spawn and much more
There are so many cheaters that it seems that the developers dont fight them at all The game has been unplayable for a long time and it looks like there wont be any improvements

"GTA V Review

Review is after completing the main story missions all side missions finding all collectibles clearing the entire map and achieving 100 completion on single player mode As a side note never cared for multiplayer
hrhr


bStoryb
My favorite GTA game was San Andreas After playing this game my favorite GTA game is San Andreas Yes that didnt change Its hard to compete against Carl Johnsons version of the heros journey Having said that GTA V is an absolute gem in a caliber of its own A diamond of a game I highly encourage gamers to 100 the single player aspect of the game As you explore the game to find all collectibles you will see just how much detail developers integrated into this world Also Space Docker is the ultimate vehicle in the game


bGameplayb
Took me a while to figure out how to do the knife flights correctly for the achievement Other than that the remainder of the gameplay was superb I was however jealous of all the cool vehicles and weapons the developer implemented in GTA Online


bGraphicsb
On a league of their own considering how detailed the world is The only benchmark they need to surpass for the next game is their own


bControlsb
Played on PC with mouse and keyboard Gameplay and gunplay was smooth and responsive 


bSide Missionsb
Completed all of them I had to you see because they were all so good


bMusicSoundtrackVoiceb
Excellent curated selection of songs as usual Voice acting from all 3 main characters was at peak quality


bPerformanceb
Experienced no crashes and the game ran smoothly on my PC which is a midrange PC It did not cause undue heating of the CPU and GPU


How in the world is Rockstar going to surpass this game Yes I know they did Red Dead Redemption 2 afterwards but that game did not have as many moving parts as this game did

Overall Score 1010"
Good
GOOD
good but modders made the experience hell by kicking me from sessions crashing my game multiple times griefing an annoyoing me
very great game
gta is gud

Its not safe to play this game online You risk exposing your IP and other information to attackers
"Like Mods Compatibility on Offline Mode Need OpenIV Good Story Mission sometime isnt Open world Compatible with FiveM
Dislike Cheating on Online Mode Still Roaming in Online Session"

All GTA games are awesome 1010
masterpiece

10 YEARS LATER AND STILL ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER CREATED
Love this game

Why did I move here I guess it was the weather Or the Ah I dont know that thing That magic You see it in the movies I wanted to retire From what I was doing you know From that that line of work Be a good guy for once a family man So I bought a big house Came here put my feet up and thought Id be a dad like all the other dads My kids would be like the kids on TV we play ball and sit in the sun But well you know how it is
so cool
Id say this is the best story line in the GTA series yet although the game is nearing 10 years old it still looks and feels great to play Im currently replaying through the story mode again

shit goes hard

too many bugs not a good game to play
You tell me exactly what you want and I will very carefully explain to you why it cannot be
Bu oyunu konsolda oynadım klavyede kontrolcüye göre çok daha kolay olduğunu söyleyebilirim 3

"needs next gen upgrade 
but gta is gta"
ok
Grand Theft Auto V remains a gaming pinnacle Its meticulously crafted world of Los Santos intertwined narrative of Michael Franklin and Trevor and seamless character switch mechanic deliver an unforgettable experience The wealth of activities from highstakes heists to chaotic police chases ensures constant excitement The addition of Grand Theft Auto Online extends the adventure offering a thriving multiplayer playground Mature themes warrant discretion In short GTA V is a masterpiece that defines openworld gaming
the most best feature in gta v shoe store
"At first I played GTA V it was fun the first couple of hours and after that it got repetitive  
I used to want to play that gta v game when I was a kid but im over it now considering I cant be bothered to play it through because it got repetitive and less fun

Been playing GTA V pretty much since it came out on the 360 i literally just started over on PC with all new Online character and everything Unfortunately it didnt take me very long to discover that hackers are still around and worse than ever About 15 minutes ago before writing this someone decided to hack my online character and forced my progress up for rank 9 to rank 30 gave me a boat load of money and then forced all the unlocks for me now i am afraid i cant play AT ALL without being banned i didnt consent to any of that and now my game is ruined I didnt do anything wrong and yet now Im the one that gets screwed I managed to contact support but all they gave me was some bs about routine sweeps for hackers and suspicious game play I have no idea how long that is going to take or if their sweep is actually gonna fix my character or just take the false money

"this game is realistic
no its not"
"single player story is on par for a rockstar game great diverse open world with diversity and lots of interesting characters to meet its not life changing by any means but the modding community keeps it real

dont recommend multiplayer rockstar has once again proven they have no expertise in netcoding security or ingenuity as the multiplayer world is filled with hackers exploiters and severe lag in any server you end up in you can pick up trainers and modpanels for this game off pretty much any website rendering the leveling system money system stock market missions races and more pointless"
amazing
too many hacker
I LOVE IT I HIJACKED A PLANE

Very easy to get banned in online but overall very great game

"Rating 

Ive had the immense pleasure of diving into the world of Grand Theft Auto V for the past five months and I can confidently say that this game is nothing short of a modern gaming masterpiece Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this openworld epic delivering an experience that sets the bar for openworld actionadventure games

Graphics and Visuals 
From the moment I stepped into the fictional city of Los Santos I was awestruck by its breathtaking visuals The attention to detail is astonishing with stunningly realistic character models lifelike environments and a daynight cycle that adds depth and immersion to the world Even after months of gameplay I still find myself stopping to admire the sunrise over the city or the reflections in the rainsoaked streets

Gameplay and Mechanics 
GTA V seamlessly blends a gripping narrative with an openworld playground that encourages exploration and experimentation The three playable protagonists Michael Franklin and Trevor each bring their unique personalities and skills to the table making for a diverse and dynamic gameplay experience The controls are intuitive and the variety of vehicles weapons and activities at your disposal ensures that boredom is a foreign concept in this game

Storyline and Characters 
The narrative in GTA V is an absolute triumph Its not just a crime caper its a thoughtprovoking exploration of the American Dream ambition and morality The three protagonists intertwined stories provide a refreshing perspective on the criminal underworld and the supporting cast of characters is as memorable as they are unpredictable The sharp writing and superb voice acting elevate the storytelling to new heights

Multiplayer 
Grand Theft Auto Online adds another layer of enjoyment to the game Whether youre racing with friends tackling heists or simply causing mayhem in the vast open world the multiplayer mode extends the games longevity indefinitely Frequent updates and a thriving online community ensure that theres always something new to discover

Conclusion
Grand Theft Auto V is an enduring gem in the world of video games Five months into my journey Im still finding new things to do new secrets to uncover and new ways to be amazed by the sheer scale and detail of Los Santos This game represents a high watermark for the industry and is a mustplay for any gamer Rockstar Games commitment to quality is evident in every pixel and the result is nothing short of breathtaking Five months in and I can confidently say that GTA V is the best game Ive ever played If you havent experienced it yet do yourself a favor and dive into this openworld masterpiece You wont be disappointed"

hehe hitting pedestrians is fun

so fun with friends 55
hi
gta
very fun 
"side note  ive played this game since launch on  off on PS always been a fan i recently built a new pc and wanted to see how GTA 5 was on M  K game is just as great as it iswas compared to my play time on console although it is quite easy to get burned out on quickly due to gameplay missions or otherwise itll always be a good addition to your library especially if you have some time to kill and just wanna bs

RECOMMENDATION  in my 10 hours of play time on PC Ive noticed that pretty much every session is filled with someone modding as well as for EVERY single freemode session Ive joined there WILL always be a modder  that joins session and spams the super loud explosion BS for which someone kicks them only for them to rejoin and do the same repetitive BS time and time again or another will join under a diff name and so same thing  most amount of koins and kicks ive seen in my 10 hours was 13 joiners in 30 mins causing loud jump scares and getting kicked within 1020 secs 

it almost seems like you need to run a mod menu just to deter the BS other people with the menus pull which is obnoxiously ignorant which honestly just adds to the burnout factor
so far Ive just stuck to playing missions once the super loud jump scares start or playing something else entirely  great job R"
very nice
THIS ISNT GTA 8
when i first got the game i read the reviews and a wise man said i just punched a women for the first time it felt good i can confurm this is true
this game will out live me at this point
fun game need to try if you are a fan of rockstar games

"Grand Theft Auto V is the most realistic life simulator Ive ever played Forget about those boring sims games where you make friends build houses and go to work In GTA V you can do it all  and then some

Pros

Excellent traffic AI NPCs drive as if theyre on a mission to reenact every action movie car chase
Realistic economics Who knew a life of crime could be so profitable Just dont ask me how I got that yacht
Endless entertainment From playing golf to parachuting off Mount Chiliad theres something for everyone
Trevor Philips Industries  the only workplace that never gets old
Cons

Terrible road rage Its hard to maintain my zenlike calm when my fellow motorists are trying to recreate the next Fast  Furious movie on the freeway
Clothes shopping addiction My character spends more on clothes than I do in real life and Im not even mad about it
Overall if youve ever wondered what its like to be a stunt driver a skydiving pro a billionaire playboy or a criminal mastermind this game has got you covered Just be prepared to lose track of time and your moral compass Ive been a criminal but Ive never been so lawabiding in my life  in a video game of course

Remember its all in good fun and the virtual world of GTA V is a riot Just try not to get too carried away or you might find yourself on the wrong side of the law in real life too"
good performance
fun
BH
great game
bro i have spent 15 hours just trying to get in the game but it says my code is already being used
"game is good but the one flaw i have is that when i got the premium version of gtav i also got the Criminal Enterprise pack DLC where i should have gotten a lot of stuff but i didnt it doesnt say that i own it in game and when i go to it in game it says buy but if i go to the steam store page it says that i have it in my library
So in other words rockstar scamed me out of my starter pack and i dont know how to fix the issueproblem
If anyone knows a solution lmk in the replys

Have a Great day

GhostWo1f"
almost ten year old game and yet still runs like dog dookie on fast gaming pc
my account got hacked then i got it back and i randomly got banned for 30  days and account reset after 800 hours i wouldent suggest this game for some low life rockstar people to ban your account no reason after i just got it back wouldent suggest playing unless you want to get banned randomly they should be more worried about modders
good game
the is fun
i like everything about gta v it  is a very fun game
very fun
there are stupid hackers in every lobby and not the fun ones and they ruin the game I cannot finish a mission ONCE BECAUSE OF THEM Come out with gta6 plz this is cringe

dis is good you like to pretend it is fun
Im an Italian gamer and this review was written entirely with Google Translate I would like to start this review by saying that despite the one star review I love Rockstar products and above all I love GTA V I have all of Bennys custom cars and 40 other vehicles I have never had any problems and in fact I have also made purchases to go forward and I dont want to cheat but I have to say I feel cheated about something that happened I switch from PS4 to PC and buy GTA I try to recover the account but I cant and after two days I search on Google and find it written that it cannot be done which I find absurd given the possibility of cross play I dont demand a refund but I do demand that a game like GTA V has the ability to transfer accounts from PS4 to PC I know maybe my review wont mean much to you but I hope you will read it and give a fan the chance to play their favorite game on PC

U want to play online huh take my advice play only on INVITE ONLY SESSIONS NEVER i repeat NEVER play on PUBLIC Sessions i tell u why first of all there will be GRIEVERS and MODDERS they will be your new friends they could be the reason you wont enjoy the online game at all second ROCKSTAR SERVERMATCHMAKING is the worst like server of all time Imagine that you stuck for HOURS in loading screen waiting to get into PUBLIC LOBBY i literally had like 100 hours of loading screen instead of game time So do me a favor start the game in offline mode first then join the online mode in INVITE ONLY SESSIONS Goodluck

"RockStar Social Club is criminal  Stop doing this for the single player experience  I get it for multiplayer and the like  But your spyware programs are annoying  Coming back to play after years of inactivity to have a little fun and the game is unplayable until solving riddles of password protections and linking accounts to play a little quiet game  After years of online and connective play this billion dollar industry have not figured a better system for ad revenues and generating commercial aspects in a user friendly way
Gamers could never come up with boycott big enough to trash these companies because the game design is excellent and the gameplay is fun but I certainly wish there would be a proactive effort by these AAA studios in delivering a solution to these grand marketing schemes
So I will instead waste my efforts in this ridiculous post as if screaming at a hurricane

Time that I could have been playing your most excellent game is now put off for the several days that I must wait for a little email so I can attempt a password reset for something I set years ago  For those people currently promoting your damn Social Club I hope your life allows that you feel sorry for your actions and the shame of this might drive you towards a change in behavior  

For those still reading this stupid post I hope you find some purpose in life that avoids these machinations that pound us slowly into the deep void of reality"

My name is Walter Hartwell White I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque New Mexico 87104 This is my confession If youre watching this tape Im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw Hank Schrader Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist Shortly after my 50th birthday Hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world Connections that he made through his career with the DEA I was astounded I I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was thrown confused but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family Hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make And I was weak I didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed Every day I think back at that moment with regret I quickly realized that I was in way over my head and Hank had a partner a man named Gustavo Fring a businessman Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when I tried to quit Fring threatened my family I didnt know where to turn Eventually Hank and Fring had a falling out From what I can gather Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which Fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated Fring was able to arrange uh I guess I guess you call it a hit on my brotherinlaw and failed but Hank was seriously injured and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over 177000 Upon recovery Hank was bent on revenge working with a man named Hector Salamanca he plotted to kill Fring and did so In fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it I have often contemplated suicide but Im a coward I wanted to go to the police but I was frightened Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me For 3 months he kept them My wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what I had done why Hank had taken our children We were scared I was in Hell I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family Recently I tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this I cant take this anymore I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me or worse hurt my family I All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is
Awesome

"Not able to log into the spyware that is Rockstar Social using my credentials so Im prevented from even starting the game Adding insult to injury when trying to log into Rockstars web to see whats going on to change my password or anything Im required to solve Extremely irritating and time consuming verification puzzles in which Im required to sum in my head several hard to see dice up to 14 mixing both dots and numerals and choose the correct picture among many others which total 13 or 15 each Just imagine yourself counting six groups of dice succesfully like this not once or twice but ten times spending minutes and minutes on the task only to either find out you made a mistake so you have to start all over or see that nothing happens and you still cant restore the account or access the game Theyre purposely showing customers the middle finger clearly the entire company hate our guts

It is unbelievable If I could start a single player session at least for a game which I paid for and I own But not even that This game and the company sucks Really sucks Rockstar is scamming the customers and the least they could do is to give a refund With Rockstar NEVER again"
this game has an oddly consistent way of crashing when alt tabbing near a cargobob 1010
This has got to be the most sucked off game ever There is no reason this game should be as popular as it is Almost everything about this game is bad The controls are so confusing is makes you feel like a toddler who has just been told to pilot an F22 raptor Like why the fuck would middle mouse button open the menu The loading time is so unreasonably long is makes you wonder if they just make it load for that long to mess with their players The game play is mid at best like there are so many other options for games you could play with the same if not better features And one of the main selling points of the game the heists are utter filth found from the deepest depths of the filthiest dump You spend 45 minutes setting it up just only for one civilian to catch a stray and make you lose all your progress and end up making 20 The game also takes up a whopping 100 gigabytes and as expected for the size takes forever yo re install It is also so poorly optimized on steam you have to make a social club account and if you forget that password then its just over for you I guess because the password resetting website crashed every time you enter a new password Only after you do some stupid extra thing you shouldnt have to do you can then reset your password And dont even get me started on how hard it is to make money you feel like you are making good progress and then you realize that the cheapest non shit car is over 1 million dollars plus for some vehicles you need special garages to even buy some of the better things Ever wonder why this game goes on sale for so cheap The only reason I play this game is because my dumb ass friends keep asking me to play it I would much rather do unpaid work than play this game For anyone who is considering buying this game who hasnt gotten it yet and for those who are considering re installing it dont

story is the only thing you can enjoy on this once great game its riddled with vile modders an d hackers that can and will grab your ip and can and will boot you from the lobby report them then right wrong the anticheat doesnt even detect the cheats in the first place  they can and are not limited too caging you like an animal spawn killing you becming god mode and unkillable try to kick them you get kicked imagine that oh and youd think rockstar would care right wrong they do nothing and even better they removed 97 of their anticheat and havent been bothered to patch anything it feels like a broken beta with EA at the healm but this time its the pathetic humans working for rockstar and take two interactive SAVE YOUR MONEY PLEASE this game is not worth even a 67 off 20 gta this level of bullshit excuse my language but damn this game is awful and new players just never come back and YOU CANT BLAME THEM

So I waited for almost ten years never played or watched denying this part of grand theft auto thinking that its worse than IV just to come to this very moment and say it was right thing to do its that poor In every aspect perhaps except satire I quickly got tired of constant raised voice shoutings this midlife crisis drama sucked out of thumb idiotic unstable characters total cringe annoying npcs and cops pseudo gangsta shit lame choice of music boring  sign missions limit of actions in the world clumsiness of character and vehicles zero guns feeling lame sound design money grinding narco missions  ahahah look hes high we should get high too and play G T A yeaaaaah and im not saying anything about online mode Fuk that sht Fourth part is much better than this LA blunt disaster Also it was absolutely brain dead decision to put Johnny from the Lost and Damned on the sacrifice altar in order to show me truly emotional and troubled side of proto hipster
The game is perfect It is a masterpiece of a open world design The only problem is the time you have to wait to play the game Sometimes I spend 15min just sitting and waiting while the game loaded Each time when I want to play I think twice if I have enough time to wait I read topics on forum and revealed that it is a common problem and Rockstar dont want to fix it Today I waited again for 15 mins looking at a rolling wheel and just closed the game without playing it It is sad

good game
I am looking for some free steam points so I can afford a mini background profile thanks 
Good
Its not really my thing anymore but if senseless mayhem is your thing then I do recommend it
dont like it
for the past 3 days i have been playing all night long
if you want a good story then yes download if u want 30 year old dudes that probably like children to come and bomb u endelessly with their pay to win account then yes download
"Really nice game to satisfy your lowkey psychopathic tendencies uhm i mean i think it reduces IRL violence amongst men i guess

Would recommend to anyone especially those thinking about doing criminal activity go vent it all out ingame my friend it really helps 

Cant wait for GTA 6"
very good game for when you are bored

Cant unlink my steam account to make a new one Got hacked really poor system they got going on here
The story is amazing
d
Grand theft auto V as the represent of the 9th art is the production which combined all techniques and inspirations of Rockstar therefore to be this greatness Its like a milestone for not only Rockstar but the whole game industry Characters in game have abundant personalities and theyre also really stereoscopic as game characters that they can actually affect players to lead them to make unusual choices when it comes to determination times in games As IGN gave this game the 1010 back to 2018 I would like to say even in the 2023 Grand theft auto V still deserves a fullscores epoch making masterpiece
Nice game but  online is hard with bad guys
""
Haha stolen car go BRRRRRRR
"The game suffered from a real stagnation over all those pvp horrible mechanics futuristic vehicles being added and much much more Now it got way better on grinding and it would be great if it wasnt for the cheaters and modders Not that Im against on adding money to your account or messing around with friends or even randoms but we all know that most of modders only grief and destroy other peoples cargo Imagine grinding or waiting for a full bunker and watching it all being destroyed by a modder who just orbd everyone in the lobby If you bought the supplies you just lost 300k but if you grinded for supply missions you just lost 3 hours of your time playing the game Im not saying that you couldnt have known the risk of selling in public lobbies but at this point you are always griefed by modders and if you dont sell in public not only you are losing profit that allows you to buy more stuff and enjoy the game but also youll find yourself playing all alone as if it was singleplayer with more content 

This game ask players to cheat because no one will grind all their lifes to get an Opel Corsa or even spend 1500 just to buy everything they want and not worry about grinding I would grind if it wasnt for modders and I prefere the pc version just for the option of playing with more than 60 fps and with mouse and keyboard

If you will ban players at least ban the ones messing up with your game everyday just griefing and killing everyone Its not even a legitimate tactic to grief its against the rules 

Part 2

The latest DLC is the worst so far Took out more content that it added

The missions are basic except for On Parade which gave me a cool challenge actually Theres no story at all we dont have any cutscenes and the side characters only speak to us on the missions we never see Charlie at all

I would actually pay at least 5 just to play a good DLC or 15 for all the things half priced Instead you just make players to pay 68 Million dollars to buy an avenger or 15M just for the upgrade and what do you get 350k Come on"

I think This Game Isa FANTASTIC
"Title Grand Theft Auto V  An Epic Experience Marred by Load Times Cheaters and Glitches

Grand Theft Auto V GTA V is undoubtedly a modern gaming masterpiece that delivers an exhilarating openworld experience like no other From the sprawling city of Los Santos to the captivating narratives of its three protagonists this game is an actionpacked adventure that has set a new standard in the gaming industry However amidst the praise there are some significant drawbacks that need addressing

First and foremost GTA Vs openworld is an absolute triumph The attention to detail in recreating Los Angeles is aweinspiring and the sheer size of the map is mindboggling Exploring this virtual world is a true joy with an abundance of side activities missions and random encounters that keep players engaged for hours on end

The characters are brilliantly written and performed with Michael Franklin and Trevor each bringing their unique charm and complexity to the story The narrative is a rollercoaster ride filled with memorable moments and unexpected twists making it one of the best in the series

The games visuals are stunning especially on more powerful hardware The attention to detail in the environment character models and vehicle designs is nothing short of remarkable The soundtrack perfectly complements the atmosphere featuring an eclectic mix of music that suits every mood

However the experience takes a hit when it comes to load times Its baffling that even on highend systems players often find themselves staring at loading screens for what feels like an eternity This issue disrupts the otherwise immersive experience and can be incredibly frustrating especially when transitioning between story missions and online play

Speaking of online play GTA Online has its share of problems The presence of cheaters and hackers in online lobbies has plagued the game since its inception Its disheartening to see players exploit the games mechanics to gain an unfair advantage ruining the experience for others Rockstars efforts to combat these issues have been inconsistent at best leaving legitimate players to suffer the consequences

Furthermore frequent glitches and bugs continue to mar the GTA V experience These can range from minor inconveniences like mission markers disappearing to gamebreaking issues that force players to restart missions or even the entire game Its frustrating to encounter these problems in a game that has been on the market for years and has received numerous updates

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V remains a gaming masterpiece that deserves praise for its openworld design storytelling and attention to detail However the long load times persistent issues with cheaters in online lobbies and frequent glitches detract from what could be a flawless experience While its certainly worth playing for its strengths its disheartening to see these issues persist in a game of such high caliber Rockstar Games should prioritize addressing these concerns to ensure that GTA V continues to shine as one of the greatest openworld games of all time"

favourite game same with postal 2 i have 2 thousand hours on gta on my xbox w game
Cuando lo compre le vicie bastantes horas al modo offline porque siempre me ha gustado su historia pero cuando entre al Online y empece a jugar me di cuenta de un problema muy serio que tiene el online Tiene tantos elementos y misiones y cosas que en vez de ayudarte te terminan tirando demasiada información y terminas sin saber que hacer sin dejar que lado que la mayoría de misiones no tienen lógica o son simplemente  extrañas Yo le pondría de calificación un 80 porque aunque sea un buen juego termino volviéndose un limón que siguen exprimiendo para sacarle todo
it goood game

"Im fucking sick and tired of game producers introducing the artificial and unnecessary requirement of being alwaysonline in this case the abysmal RSG launcher  Ive been playing their titles since GTA3 was still the latest entry so literally for decades but this crap is the last straw for me  I put up with it before for both GTAV and RDR2 but Im done dealing with it for both

I realize I only have to provide it once unless their shit fucks up of course but I shouldnt have to provide it fucking ever  They know I bought the fucking game I got it on Steam FFS  This shit is just unnecessary trouble for their own damn loyal customers

So RSG can permanently fuck all the way off"

"I wish there was a way to review the single player and multiplayer separately The single player is missing lots of things that you expect from a modern title mostly because the single player is about 10 years old at this point literally 9 days away from a 10 year anniversary as I write this But otherwise the single player game is about everything youve come to expect from a great developer like Rockstar The multiplayer game is about everything you expect from an absolutely scumbag horrible publisher like TakeTwo Interactive The multiplayer is bugged as shit has almost no incentive to play filled with griefers and hackers oh sorry modders is 10 years old and TakeTwo have literally said they dont want you playing their game if you dont buy shark cards
Im just going to go ahead and say dont buy this game Even for the single player its a bit old and there are better single player games out these days ie Witcher 3 Fallout etc The multiplayer is a horrendous piece of dog shit that is so obviously tacked on by TakeTwo as a way to try to milk this game for all the money they can get so they dont have to fund a new GTA game for as long as possible

The real takeaway from GTA5 should really be that you should be extremely wary of GTA6 Im sure Rockstar will do an absolutely amazing job on developing the game and the single player campaign but TakeTwo is going to ruin it like they do everything else Hell look at the state of KSP2  that is TakeTwo really pushing that game into early access before its ready  And remember TakeTwo wanted to shut down ALL mods for KSP1 TakeTwo is a horrendous piece of shit publisher right up there with the likes of Electronic Arts but doesnt get quite the flak that Electronic Arts gets because TakeTwo mostly works on things that arent quite as mainstream for PC or for things that are mostly console titles like GTA

Avoid GTA5 and Id avoid buying GTA6 until well after release when it starts going on sale maybe not even then  lets see the reviews first"

I love GTA V its a great game and i want everyone to play it at least once game of the century bro
After owning this game since launch putting almost 100 hours into I am now required to enter an activation code Good thing Steam lets you check your key Oh the game is telling me its already in use of course its in use by me Great job Rockstar truly living up to your name

"This game is a great game that is ruined by a useless and greedy dev My friend recently had his social club account hacked and his information changed Despite many attempts to prove his identity to Rockstar including receipts screenshots and video evidence they have refused to validate his identity He has 1000 hours in this game and they are willing to treat him this way I can safely say I will not be buying GTA 6 if you know what I mean  Fuck Rockstar

I know this wont do anything but I am pissed at Rockstar and want to warn others to ensure their accounts are extremely secured lest it happen to you


UPDATE

After 2 weeks and 6 support tickets he finally got them to realise he was him so I guess good job Rockstar 610"

this review becomes positive as soon as Rockstar changes to dedicated servers

Unplayable garbage without downloading 3rd party software and joining a specific community to play with All online lobbies are plagued with hackers and modders that exist only to advertise services for sale or grief everyone All the fanboys excited to GTA6 are too stupid to realize you cant even play the games they already have out as intended because they wont moderate anything and wont ban anyone They simply dont even try
D
cool
i love gta5

"This game is gold and will never die out for me Best 1048 spent of my life Highly recommend if u neva played GtaV

Game is very very good must play this game once in life no any issue with Rock star games eagerly waiting for GTA 6 GTA V is a masterpiece no doubt The game is playable until you have battery in laptop otherwise this game dont feel you boring so this game is very awesome and enjoyable A lot of people had dream in their life to play GTA V once in their life Yes tahts true I knew so No any drawbacks of playing this game but game is suitable for adults only because one or two missions had adult scene so that only can be improved rest is SIMPLY AWESOME
OG

I hate the fucking tutorial of this game so timecomsuming 
Yeah i really like the story and the game completed it a few times on playstation But i wont play it on my Computer for now since i have a poor one that doesnt have the requirements for the game I will get a future pc where i will play Grand theft Auto on it

ive played it a bit still broke in online
Shit game
Just leaving my 420 hour review
"Rockstar has done nothing to address the modder problems that are well known on PC Almost every GTAO lobby 

 You can have your account banned remotely by a modder
 You can have funds removed from your account by a modder
 Invite only lobbies  closed lobbies dont help you as they are even able to kill you in SINGLEPLAYER
 They can teleport you  everyone around the map at will and kill you at will
 They can make you stumble in an endless loop so that you arent able to move
 The mods that they are using potentially go further than GTA and can be used to penetrate your PC

A firewall is a potential way to protect yourself but it doesnt make you invulnerable to these exploits
This game has been out for 10 years and these problems still persist if you choose to play GTAV youre doing so at your own risk as this has spawn an environment for people to exploit without consequences

Storys as good as ever but if you want to play Online your options are limited unless you want to be part of the cesspool
jjjj
yes
this is a timeless game
Great GTA game with latest tech and story is pretty nice as well Overall its great story and gameplay is great overall There are some things i hated about this game is that game missions are not played how you want to but have to play how its desinged Also would be nice to have more fun activities to earn more money
YES
shit game
k
best realistic game ever
good game
fun
its fun
Online has a lot of cheaters on PC and connection issues severs can be shaky at times and the load times increase do to this but if you can learn to deal with it i do recommend this game Rockstar honestly gave it their all and the game can be fun and entertaining  i guess if you play the campaign only you dont have to worry about these issues the story mode is job well done Every game has its issues i try to think of it that way
Game has a crazy amount of options of things to dobut it is rather buggy and many aspects are terrible like flying on PC is god awful So i find it odd the game is highly against mods when so many mods can fix a lot of quality of life changes I would love to play online with my friends with some of the quality changes but I worry about getting banned Unless i am terrorizing a lobby Idk why I cant fast travel across the map instead of waiting 30 minutes IRL to get to my destination 3 outta 5
This game ages like fine wine Its still good

"Updated review 
I think theyre letting the game sink by choking new players from most profits Youll probably need at least 100 hours of grind as a new player to get to a barely good enough state IF you put all your money into businesses Its going to be a really tedious grind cause you will need 2 heists just to buy ONE CAR The best profit avenue has been ridiculously nerfed and considering it takes about 1hr to set up and 100k ingame currency just to start setting up I can no longer justify baring with the tediousness of the best profit avenue on the game

R probably just want players to move on to GTA 6 when it comes at this point so I suggest saving up both your timeand your money and wait for it to come out

Old review 
Ironically enough the Grand Theft Auto part fades the longer you play the game cause youll end up using cars you own and worked hard to pay for anyway Or not use a car at all"
it is good
I bought the retail version of this game when it first launched It worked fine with no issue at all for years Then one day Rockstar decided to launch their own launcher All my Rockstar games stopped working even the ones I had on steam Since then Ive periodically tried to fix the issue and play GTA V Tired of not having it work I decided to buy it on Steam and see if anything changed although I knew it wouldnt Ive got every error code in the book Ive tried every fix all the official ones all the Reddit ones nothing This garbage company decided to release their trash garbage launcher and I cant play the games Ive payed for At least I can refund this one Rockstar fix your garbage trash launcher no one wants or get rid of it I only want to play singleplayer why cant I bypass your garbage trash launcher I finally decided to let the game run with the error code so I could write a review This review is all I can do the quiet echo of my voice will fade into nothingness while this garbage trash company run by donkeys continues to profit GTA IV and GTA V two of my all time favorite games now forever taken from me because the donkeys running this company wanted to gather more power Maybe one day it wont be garbage trash anymore Maybe one can dream
RECOMMENDABLE
TIME PASS OSEM GAME

Fantastic game The heists and online gameplay is soothing
I just hope I live to see GTA 6

My favorite Los Angeles simulator I can drive the 110 to the 5 North without having 17 panic attacks All of the online issues including the ability for modders to see your IP address made it sadly unplayable but as far as a piece of software goes Absolutely Tremendous

absolutely love the game cant wait for GTA 6 and hoping that it can be run in 4k but all round this is a really incredible game with alot of laughs and fun in their definitely going to get 100 achievement for this
"Perfect game for children and even toddlers with a wide range of charismatic and kind characters such as Trevor and Michael
who are spectacularly written in such a way where you cant help but fall in love with there sheer optimism and loving personalities
furthermore this game features an incredible online multiplayer where your child may create their own custom character and head out into the fictional world of los santos ready to do an assortment of exciting and enjoyable activities such as golf darts arm wrestling and even visiting the shoe icon on the map near the centre of the city it is at this icon where the player will be able to purchase all kinds of shoes and other footwear

in conclusion this game is a great choice for you and your family ESPECIALLY your kids and while your at it buy them a few shark cards "

"The problem is this idiotic Rockstar Social Club bullshit 

If you did not play the game for a long time and if you do not have access or remember the social club email you used the first time You are shit out of luck You will never play the game again 

The game is locked into the first social club you created via Steam and there is no way to reset the login and the Rockstar Help desk is useless Which is not surprising The support options in games are for the most part complete and utter shite 

I guess I will delete the game and forget I ever played it"

Riddled with hackers absolutely insane prices for cash grab grinding annoying 12 year olds people feeling the need to be pieces of shit 247 worst community Terrible UI loading screens heists are fucked solo play is annoying and almost impossible Ive tried doing a heist setup 4 times for a hacker to fuck up my mission begging for telegram money How about you actually put some effort into your game to prevent one piece of shit from ruining everyones experience youve had over a decade and you sit on your asses collecting money from the shark cards Sad thing is im still gonna keep playing if gta 6 is anything remotely like this im never buying a rockstar game again

There are 2 thing I highly dislikes  Cheater and lagging

Both happen when Online mode I dont know if there is mod that player can go invincible if there is highly suggest remove those its super annoying when 1 play fair and the other using cheat mode Heres my best solution for DEV Update the game by adding anticheat mode for Online so the cheater are blocked"

"this game was fun and all but tbh its like beating a dead horse the game needs to hurry up and release the next gta and let this one die in the past 5m servers would be fun but they also are trash due to all the wannabe gangster kids that vdm or rdm every chance they get aslo keep in mind 5m is not friendly to new players they expect everyone to just automatically know how to do everything  
long story short yes gta5 was fun in like 2013 but its a little over played at this point i need a new map and new things to do"

A solid wellwritten game you start out as a heist member where in a suddenly turn of events things go wrong and you and your buddy Brad are sniped 
Fast forward a decade later you play as a exFamilies Gang member named Franklin Clinton repoing a car for Simeon Yeterian 
You are eventually tasked to repo a car from a kid named Jimmy De Santa and sure enough you get a handgun pointed to your dome 
Turns out that man you played as Michael Townley is now Michael De Santa 
who faked his death during the heist to enter a Witness Protection Program 
Smash into the car shop window Michael pays you for a job well done 
The games events then spontaneously kick off from that and propels the plot
      
There is a variety of activists to do in Los Santos or Blaine County such as events Strangers and Freaks Activities and some events get your new heist members for future heists The gunplay in the game is linear but smooth and intuitive 
The special abilities the trio have are unique and engaging
 It helps you to have an edge over the various enemies in the world such as the Los Santos Police Department 
the Ballas etc 
Activities are somewhat repetitive and boring after a while 
The Strangers and Freaks mission is a mixed bag some of the characters are fun and engaging 
while others are monotone and annoying 
Tasked with different tasks based on the Stranger you are dealing with and what they want

The game in my playthrough which is somewhat rushed but also doing all the events and a quarter of the Strangers and Freaks missions the entire length of the game took me about 392 hours to beat A felt like a real ride with a sense of achievement based on the 1 of 3 endings you choose That will be something you will have to find out in your playthrough 

8510 would strongly recommend this game for its singleplayer experience alone not so much for online because of the rampant hackers in lobbies"

"Story good
online bad"
HAHA
Amazing game with great assets A lot of things to unlock in the Story Mode but also a great experience while playing in Online Mode Definitely a game youll be playing for a long time as grinding everything costs a lot of time This does match up with very good results though so its definitely worth the playtime
No one is Going to read this review so i want to confess that i am gay

"You can recreate 911

Worst load times by a huge margin in any game ive played or seen For each time u load somewhere like walking into your house theres a 20 chance it will NEVER load and u will have to alt f4 to restart Game is made of 10 cheaters who can do anything they want to u and usually have godmode Starting out is very confusing and doesnt give u any guidance so rely on looking everything up Any vehicle u will want is incredibly unaffordable and will cost u ur whole bank account which u spent hours doing boring tasks to save up UI is horrible and keybinds dont make any sense They different for doing the same thing in different scenarios Definitely dont waste ur time with this game Its over 10 years old and it shows Too much
ONE OF THE GREATEST OPEN WORLD GAME OF ALL TIME GTA V THE GOAT OF THE VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY
game speaks for itself
Its GTA 5 go buy it
wagwan g
best game by far
The added a membership and have removed old cars to put them into the membership They are straight up going for money and do not care about their gamers Its worse micro transaction tactics than EABlizzard Garbage ill just mod my game and get everything for free or play on a modded server
My account got stolen after 6 years and there is no way to recover it

THIS IS SO FUN I CAN RUN OVER PEOPLE
"I recommend the game for the story mode which is the quintessential GTA V experience that weve all known for the last 10 years 

This game is probably the most fun driving experience Ive had outside of dedicated racing games and every other game falls short when compared to this one

HOWEVER ONLINE MODE

As a new player you should be super aware that modders in lobbies are very common And most have a superiority complex About 60 of the time its fine unless you try to get in a fight with one in which case you will have a bad time being stuck in a death loop Best way to avoid that is to just type in chat that youre going to go AFK and stop giving them the satisfaction they give up super quickly or just move to a new lobby of course

Even ignoring modders as a new player its pretty hard to get to the good content which is all the expensive stuff in the game this truly is the American dream which Rockstar has made millions from over the last 10 years I used to play the game on console so Ive had an easier time getting used to it however 90 of modders are selfish but occasionally youll get random modders wholl just give you a tonne of XP and money which can help you skip a lot of grinding

If you ever reach the point you get a lot of items good cars guns apartment etc its pretty satisfying

Online mode is full of modders usually fine until they decide to grief you in which case you move to a new lobby you can still have fun in the game though theres a lot to do and sometimes its kinda overwhelming as a new player if youre lucky a nice modder will just give u money and levels and then you can actually enjoy the game its a slick experience when you have a lot of the stuff otherwise its a pain to grind"
best game ever
its so good
Got locked out of my account showed them that I clearly bought the game from my steam account to reconnect my rockstar to a new account they said they cant verify that its my account WHAT DO YOU MEAN I SPENT 60 BUCKS ON THIS GAME
fun specially online
good game very entretaining
good
franklin
GTA 5 is one of my favorite games i have played I think that the story is great and in depth with characters as well as the beautiful details  of the map that rockstar put in the game gta online is when you get to the fun part of the game when doing heists and buying all of the cool things the shop  has to offer The the things you should be aware of are the glitchesbugs and the amount of griefers in online mode
everthig
i launched the games online mode and afk for 30 mins after i came back it was still loading wtf
hegh
nothing like the console game and driving is really a bugger
Shawty kno I kill people
money moves
heheheheeh i like doing illegal stuff
probably one of the best games of all time
""
driving isnt the greatest the wheels turn on their own to stop you from drifting  probaubly because every 12 year old cant drive so they had to make it so easy that you cant even spin out on purpose to have some fun and try to drift also random cars on the street shouldnt handle the same as a 3 million dollar car
Id play again
awesome
game is genuinely one of the worst made games ive ever played lmao everytime you die during a heist setup it spawns you next to the thing that kills you cant even get back in the vehicle you came in cause it got impounded i pray to god these game developers burn in hell for the rest of time how did anyone think this was a good idea
No one reads the reviews so Im going to say that Im not the real Jim Halpert
GREAT CHOICE
so many fucking hackers

its fun
Just wait for GTA 6 It is promised to be better

Fun Story mode I love the driving  When you have had a bad day murdering a bunch of random digital people can be oddly calming  Not at all safe to play in front of the kids I  do not enjoy the Trevor story that much It leans into psychopath too much for me

Fantastic
"Singleplayer story is amazing Have played it multiple times both on consoles and PC
GTA Online has changed for the worse with in my opinion lazy DLC The grinding nature is not fun Stupid vehicles like the MK2 opressor which every sweat will use even towards a new level 1 player

Still doing your daily objectives in GTA Online is quite fun

If you have never played the story of GTA V before then I highly recommend you doing so"
fucking hackers in this game  gta 5 no goood
lol
Good game is very fun
The game is awesome point blank but the one thing that plagues this game and Rockstar seems to not even care or they are promoting it in the background is the modders and hackers its sad to see this game at this state Its not hardly playable just today of me playing every session had hackers or modders in it its also sad to see the money that we the players put into the game go to the way side and over a billion company cant or wont even put it back into the game to fix the problem and not just ignore it
Solitude in E Minor
The most cancerous and horrible game ever created The joy has been sucked out of this game since 2015 the only people who play this now are degenerate losers who ride on skybikes blowing you up out of nowhere Rockstar has proven several times they hate their audience and customers leaving users IP addresses exposed in public servers and destroying modders careers If you think GTA 6 is going to be any different or better you should take a good look at how this game was treated for over a decade

INSANE GAMEE
Forget about what percentage of reviews are positive    look at the NUMBER of reviews here This is a milestone in gaming and anyone who likes video games should play it Its a really good story and it doesnt get boring at any point The worst thing about this game is that I cant let my kids play it yet
"Would not let me adjust my brightness to be able to see the game to play in online mode  You can do this in story mode though  Thats dumb enough for me to not want to play anymore after coming back from a long break  There is no way to change this in online mode to make the game playable while it is nighttime  I would have to quit mission load into story mode turn it up or down and have to wait for time of day to change to make sure I can SEE  That is the most asinine thing I have ever had to do to change a setting

After another hundred hours Ive grown tired of the timemoney walls  I cannot complete sell missions without running out of time if I solo  The rest of the time is spent solely on resupplies  No other way to make decent money  Had I known the hangar takes 50 resupply missions to fully stock I would have never bought it  Takes me so long to generate the millions it took just to see my time spentmoney gained go right out the window  So much so that I uninstalled and will not play this again  

So I played it again  This time I bought a office so I can be able to buy a warehouse so I would be able to buy a Phantom Wedge  Turns out that it was not very forthcoming with what I needed to buy in order to unlock the Phantom Wedge Instead I bought some crate business that requires me to buy the stuff in order to sell  Also I cant store the truck I want to buy there but instead have to buy yet another worthless to me warehouse in order to store a truck  So many cash holes to deal with just to be able to buy the stupid truck  Could not find a single guide online or video explaining this process  So dumb I just want to drive a truck with a wedge  why is this so hard to do 

All in all if you wanna play this game do the story mode use hax to get stuff u dont wanna waste time getting and have your fun and move on"

love GTA V loved it on PS3 4 5 and now PC being able to mod it offline has opened up an entire world of replayability for me that a game is still relevant 10 years after launch really speaks to the quality assurance at rockstar where devs like ubisoft bethesda 2K and EA release brokenunfinished game after game  Rockstar has been pretty consistent in releasing quality product
ITS GOOD

"Assalamu alaykum dear friends and gamers Allow me to share my thoughts on the captivating world of Grand Theft Auto V This game set in the sprawling streets of Los Santos reminds me of the diverse landscapes and cultures of our Middle Eastern lands a blend of tradition and modernity

In Grand Theft Auto V players find themselves navigating the intricate web of crime and ambition much like the stories of ancient civilizations and the great caliphates of the past The game offers a rich tapestry of characters each with their own motivations and desires mirroring the complexities of human nature that have fascinated our scholars for centuries

The virtual Los Santos a sprawling metropolis mirrors the bustling cities of our region with its towering skyscrapers and crowded streets The attention to detail in this game is akin to the intricate mosaic work found in our historical mosques every pixel a testament to the dedication of the creators

One cannot ignore the exhilarating vehicular chases and heists that form the core of the gameplay As we navigate the dangerous criminal underbelly of Los Santos its as if we are embarking on a thrilling desert caravan journey braving the elements and facing the unknown The rush of adrenaline is akin to the heartpounding feeling one might experience during a challenging pilgrimage to Mecca

Yet it is crucial to acknowledge that Grand Theft Auto V also touches upon the consequences of our actions a reflection of the teachings of Islam The choices made by the characters and by extension the player have repercussions that resonate throughout the games narrative It serves as a reminder of the importance of ethical conduct and the consequences of ones deeds in line with our faiths teachings

The sound design of the game with its blend of Middle Easterninspired music and modern beats creates a unique atmosphere that resonates with our cultural heritage while immersing us in the world of Los Santos

However it is essential to approach Grand Theft Auto V with a discerning eye and a commitment to the values of Islam The game does explore themes of violence and criminality and it is crucial to maintain a sense of balance and responsibility in our interactions with it

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a remarkable experience that like the tapestry of Islam weaves together a multitude of elements into a vibrant and engaging whole It invites us to explore the human condition and navigate the complexities of a dynamic world reminding us of the everevolving nature of our own lives Approach it with wisdom and reflection and you may find it to be a thoughtprovoking journey through the streets of Los Santos Peace be upon you all"

Instead of starting the game there starts a Launcher In said launcher I am demanded to craft an account After about 20min of work for complying my account is refused because the launcher insists that I must use another account that it insists I would possess that I know nothing about So thanks for nothing If GTA VI would suffer the same limitation then that will unchoicefully imply my lack of accessibility meaning in addition that I will not buy it
W game make s me have an fucking orgasm

"way better frames than on consoles I have played this game on a ps4 for about 4 years now and this is a massive improvement 

if youre looking for more customizability I advise you to add mods like Menyoo and any Simple Trainer since that gta online dlc cannot be spawned in without a trainer it is one of the best mod menus out there"

Cant afford anything

Buy the submarine
Grind Cayo Perico for 30 hours
Fly around on the rocket bike blowing people up cause there is no endgame
Realize you have blown 200 hours and never had a second of fun
30 of those hours were spent in loading screens
uninstall"
As someone who played it on Xbox over 5 days worth playtime I would definitely recommend this game for PC If youre coming from console it may take some getting used to but its a fun game to play overall no matter what device youre playing on
Helps you practice what to do when people test you IRL
is fun

"My first GTA game Great story interesting characters but some missions are quite boring but Stranger mission are real fun and the writing done in this game is great
GTA Online though is still up for debate for me since it was fun at first but after a while when you have tons of money in your bank it does get quite boring Not many interesting going on since the updates are really slow and there are double and even triple money events but like I said it does get boring after you reach a certain limit but achieving that limit is quite fun I guess

GTA Games have one thing in common Its storytelling And GTA 5s story was great as usual The graphic The mechanic There wasnt much to badmouth Variety of new cars And I loved the online It gave me and others a chance to play with friends and make friends But just like others I didnt like it when most of the cars were erased from online shops But lets get back to story mode I liked Trevor the most His character indepth was amazing Hes cruel but not a psychopath He loves his mom and values loyalty which is shown in Ending B When Franklin asks for Trevors help to kill Michael Trevor refuses instantly But when it is Ending A Michael agrees It tells that Michael values his family more than anything He tells it on some occasions as well And as for Franklin Hes the street man who wants to leave that life behind But he just upped the game From the interactions and everything from these three characters I thought Trevor was the muscle Michael was the leader Franklin was the peacekeeper Bonus Lester was the brain And Theres more to the story than what I explained Other than just playing the online I suggest you play the story mode as well But the most important part in the story In my own conclusion Was the three protagonists Theyre all in the end doing what theyre doing to achieve a better life And I think I rumbled too long xD
Its GTA V
I CANT GET INTO THE GAme anymore waaaaaaaaa
trfefeer
fun
"Online is an abomination I cant get into any lobby where people modding make the game completely unplayable I am getting teleported into random spots and killed over and over if I try and do a job I can spend all this time completing objectives only for someone at the very last second to make enemy vehicles fly all over and all of the cars tires to explode at the same time I cant even do a race without someone just blowing up my wheels over and over until they finish and cant control it anymore i guess I loved this game on console back when it was first out and after rebuying it for pc I wish I could get a refund

best gta ever
Ive been playing it since 2015 and it always get me into it from how thriving the game is especially having all the things Im interested in Shooting racing robbery grinding to get money I would recommend this to my friends
j
NNNN
good game
"A game that was made in 2013 and still holds up in 2023 10 YEARS LATER  respect I wont even complain about the amount of hackers and cheaters always teleporting all over the map and stuff but even just playing the story mode is still brilliant 

The only thing that i am now desperately waiting for is for the developers to PLEASE HURRY UP AND RELEASE GRAND THEFT AUTO 6 Why is it taking soooooo long to publish GTA 6 Please launch it and also put it here on STEAM FIRST

Otherwise I love this game its cool"
this game is goated
ther is sxe Some kid in the reviews of GTA IV here on steam
gun go pew pew then you get money

GOATNot much more to be said

ok
best gamee  ofccc
very good game
its fun and can keep me entertained for a long time
running over people is entertaining to say the least
where is the strip club
This is not towards Steam or the Actual game itself This is due to the very horribly integrated Social Club that has caused me and many others to suffer for what we paid for Recently had my Social Club account hacked and the hacker linked their email to my Steam purchase of GTA I have managed to reobtain my account and made sure to activate 2FA so it doesnt happen again but now im stuck waiting on Rockstar support to relink my steam purchase of GTA to my Social Club account so I can even play the game on single player They do not allow you to play the game without being signed into social club so im stuck with a game I own that I cant play even offline if wanted to and tbh I dont even know if Rockstar will even relink the game to my account so I may just be screwed guess I will find out within the next week or so whenever they decide to get back to me
THE BEST GAME UVE GOT TO CHECK IT OUT
This is a good game i like to EAT RATS AND BE A RAT IN THE GAME like in a rat costume
hoped on stuck at the trevors misson with the plane so fucking hard and boring to do so i decided to play online while im constantly getting fucked by flying cars that are getting drived by proffesional ph stars
best game ewer fr frrr
"Its a Grand Theft Auto game whats not to like

Graphics are brilliant story is amazing online components are super fun I have over 1000 hours on my PS3 and even more on the PS4 before playing it more here With the right group of people online heists are extremely fun It might come off as grindy but it is worth it

Highly recommend for that someone that somehow still does not own this masterpiece"
fun
good game with lots to do in online mode
"5700 hrs on record and still its look like the first time i played  
Its fair to say this game is the best game of my life  spoilerafter CSGO lolspoiler "

lovely game 1010
As a recent indoctrinate into PC gaming Ive recently been revisiting games from my childhood I spent 500 hours on GTA 5 on the Xbox 360 watching strippers and now I can put another 500 doing it on my PC The 4k textures just make all 3 inches get nice and thick unlike the hair on Trevor Phillips head Would recommend

"If you buy this game at 2023 its still worth the money Why its 2013 game with 2015 graphics AI and Tech Then why should you purchase this Well surprisingly its for the ONLINE part of GTA V thats makes it worth the buck Now I know GTA vets will be pissed off at this comment But truth is as a beginner in 2023 youll be smashed with 10 years worth of content So youll be overwhelmed with how much this game has to offer And in my opinion the freedom  abundance of choices is what makes this the Best GTA game ever made

And yes in my opinion GTA V story  GTA 4 story because story is aware about and embraces the dual nature of characters and leaves it upto the player to choose their perspective This is something GTA 4 couldnt do it properly"
I love the fact that you can kind of do whatever you want in this game and its very fun 100 recommend for people abov the age of 15

yes mani like that but i wanna more interesting weekly update and more easily to make moneybut is so gooodlove u3

This game gave me a lot of emotions both positive and negative While I was going through the story line I was worried about the fate of the characters of the game which was developing very rapidly in an extraordinary way The game gives the player a choice of ending the game by either killing one of their friends or saving them Online of this game is fun playing with your friends in different fun modes but there are also story missions I liked one of them Doomsday which is divided into 3 acts because the events there are rapidly developing the main characters are betrayed by a crazy AI owner who is trying to destroy the world but we prevent him from doing it But in this game there are enough bugs desynchronizations some of which are very old and not resolved Anyway the game is good

Story mode is a timeless classic Online is really fucked riddled with hackers and glitchy as hell Also the snack and armor system in online is one of the worst healing systems in any video game ever Overall fun to play with friends but I feel bad for all the solo online players

Great game in general Multiplayer in 2023 is questionable no doubt there will be modders in every lobby But I would recommend anyone who has any modding knowledge or wants to get into modding Singleplayer should give this game a try I have been putting my last 40 hours in game using the LSPDFR mod and it gives this game so much more replay ability
it sure is the fifth one alright

"refunded played the game years ago when it came out on xbox one have since built a pc but cant play because rockstar refuses to unlink my old rockstar account that i no longer have access too  they said that if i unlinked the account the game would never be able to play online not going to play around with the AAA game companies anymore they make billions of dollars off of us and cant even pay for proper customer service  this is after having to argue with them for THREE YEARRS to convince them that i own my copy of rdr2 which of course i preordered like a dumbass

TLDR Rockstar is a shitty company and you shouldnt support them"

Cant sing high enough praise for this game Clearly a work of passion from a hard working team of enthusiastic developers Dont be foolish and mistake it for a cash grab that would be unfair Years of neglect are clearly demonstrated from the moment you connect to a Vanilla multiplayer server But fret not FiveM to the rescue just overlook the recent acquisition by the infamous Rockstar as Im certain they wont screw with that right
it a good game but way more better if put mods on there
i love this game so much

this game is all good and i played it fully like 10 times on diferent types of devices but that aint the problem when i first downloaded this game and payed 20 dolars for it on steam i finished the story mod and decided to hop on online mod it was all good but 2 3 days later i wanted to hop on it takes time to open from loading screen and it says you are attemting to acces gta servers on altered version of this game please come back to gta v  how am i using an altered version of the gamee if i bought it directly from the store
I probably only spent 150 hours on this the rest was all idle time for my nightclub business This is the game Im most embarrassed of my playtime regardless Red Dead 2 is better in every way

gotta love the godmodes hackers and modders in every lobby REALY difficult to sell cargo and make money with all the griefers who just obliterate you with orbital cannons story mode 910 very good online is horrible only way to play is in invite only sessions but thats realy boring and isolating reccomend it if your playing online with friends who can either protect and help you or if you like the loneliness of invite only but story mod is great if your buying for that reason
"Been trying for a while to enjoy this game and I cant I will certainly never recommend anyone actually get this Even if you were at literal gunpoint and told to buy it it is not worth it

 AI 100 aimbots to compensate for terrible or lack thereof design Getting one or twoshot by a meth head who is barely wearing pants from 2 blocks away blind fire with a pistol gets really fucking old fast Getting swarmed by enemies that can see through objects and nail you with impossible precision is a joke People that defend this are on actual drugs For the essentially unlimited funding this game had to develop they barely thought about what was balanced or fun

 Combat is stupid Defenders of this trash will say its realistic while flying an oppressor jetbike and being unkillable hacks that Rockstar does nothing about It leaves little to the imagination to WHY some people get those hacks in the first place To enjoy the fucking game even at others expense which the game encourages you to do anyway

 Players are 99 toxic Good luck finding anyone in public lobbies who isnt a prick The game rewards bad behavior Literally Good for you not being a prick Heres 2000 By the way grief those players and youll make twenty times that Only met a couple cool people in online its a mess

 Lost interest in the story for single player NPCs with godlike aim killing me immediately and no amount of health increases or armor matters The armored Kuruma is the only way to make most things possible let alone fun Still because the devs are stupid sometimes you will be killed by enemies which have absolutely no way to hit you armor building walls doesnt matter This system solely exists to waste your time and money Armor at best takes one pistol shot MAYBE something else but you will never notice Its immediately gone by some dipshit firing blind a mile away Fun

 Everything revolves around shark cards Every aspect of playing making money is designed by an idiot so you get impatient and buy a shark card to skip the gameplay to earn it so you can buy the thing you want

 If you havent gotten the picture by now nothing more I can add will get through to you Just stay away from it Or dont and be miserable

Do not support this shit heap Its made a gajillion dollars and me never supporting them ever again will not even register in these assholes wallets Do not spend money on this Ever There are far cheaper and more entertaining things to do to make you hate life

Fuck this game"

"hey its not like a review but like a beginners guide to make money in gta online 
So your main objective is to buy the Kosatka sub for 22Mil
And that 22milyoull earn by doing heistsbut first youll already have 1mil since i think everyone get the criminal starterpack for free
so heres what you get for free
11mil from criminal starter pack
2500K if you enable 2 factor authentication in your rockstar account

So you still need 700k
If you want to do it by your own then run apartment heistsYou can do it by either going to ur house and then starting one or just use the quick join from ur phoneId suggest you to do the apartment heists since they pay you decent for the time of the mission

Or if you want to do it the quick way then
make a reddit account and go to rheistteams

then ask ppl to run heist for youthere are some really generous ppl there so you may get lucky therealso there are many other ways by doing the pistol questcompleting the flight schoolweekly time trail etc

but this is the pc versionthis game is filled with filthy motherfucking hackers which are desperate to ruin your dayso either play in a public lobby in passive mode or just play in a private session

and sorry for bad english"

"Ive played this game for 550 hours 543 of those are online Up until about 34 months ago this game was great for the GTA Online portion

GTA Online has become so infested with moddershackers that 3 out of 4 sessions you join have you getting hunted down by some idiot in godmode getting killed repeatedly until you have to leave your session only to join that session and have you and everybody else in the lobby get blown up from a guy 50 miles away using a mod menu You then leave THAT session and get teleported to the other end of the map just to get killed repeatedly by another idiot in godmode then the next session somebody using a mod menu disconnects you and everybody else from the lobby with the push of a button then you have some guy cashdrop you a huge amount of modded money without askingagainst your will and get YOUR account flagged as a potential hacker even though youre one of the legitimate players Get the picture

Honestly if Rockstar did something about the hackers and modders this review will turn to an enthusiastic yes but as of the last 3 months I havent been able to do anything at all due to the sheer amount of modders Im talking spending 3040 minutes out of every hour played session hopping to find one without a greifing modder

Rockstar fix your platform this is absolutely ridiculous"

The story campaign is fun to play through online is a horror show for legit players almost no point of even playing online unless your okay with people who only know how to mod and hack Makes missions and doing anything multiplayer pointless though And it doesnt appear Rockstar even knows where to begin to remove these modders and hackers If you call out the hackers in game they have the ability to just crash your game so reporting them is also useless

best game ever for freely to move everywhere
Honestly hate the fact the cayo perico heist has been messed with so r can groom little kids into buying their shitty shark cards The newer dlc has been atrocious to say the least with either having little content or none at all
bIts a shame that Rockstar cant read the antigaming law with understanding This law prohibits playing with real money or virtual money that can be exchanged back for real money Neither of these is the case in GTA V so it is incomprehensible that games such as roulette etc are blocked in Poland There is no law applies even though we can buy GTA with the Shark card because the Shark card is a good andor service By playing we can lose the virtual cash we get as part of this service As long as Rockstar does not allow the exchange of tokens or GTA into currency Zlotys Dollars Euros etc there is no question of violating the AntiGambling Act because there is no physical gain and therefore nothing to charge tax on The purpose of the law is to seal the collection of tax because before the law there were a lot of points where the profit had the person who placed the Slots did not pay tax on it as well as the player did not pay taxb
its coo i guess even tho it taking 10years for gta6

"before you read my review this is my alt because I play story mode my actual account as over 1400 HRS on it

A Bumpy Ride

Rating 

So I just have to vent about my time with GTA 5  especially the online part Strap in folks because this isnt going to be a joyride

I dont know from where to start but here we go  First of all the online mayhem 
GTA 5 online More like GTA Cheaters Paradise The place is swarming with players using mod menus making it feel like a lawless wasteland Rockstars effort to clean this mess Well its nonexistent Plus the ingame prices are so absurdly high a car that you can buy for 100K is worth of 4M  Recent updates Yeah theyve made the game feel like a wild circus not in a good way

Server are too slow buggy and laggy
The servers are terrible and buggy Trying to enjoy a heist mission Prepare for a chaotic mess of crashes and glitches Its almost like they want you to give up

and dont get me started with the customer support its a nightmare in Itself

My online account had a problem that basically kept me from playing When I finally reached out to their support it felt like shouting into the void Response times were painfully long and when they did reply their help was about as useful as a chocolate teapot did you try to delete and reinstall the game To top it all off they had the audacity to mark my ticket as resolved when in reality it was anything but resolved Talk about frustrating

so far the only thing I liked is the story mode
The only saving grace in this GTA 5 ordeal is the story mode Its a genuine masterpiece with no cheaters in sight to ruin the fun If youre thinking about diving into this game Id strongly advise sticking to the story mode and steering clear of the online chaos GTA 5s story mode is a gem but the online mode is a wild mess of cheaters walletdraining prices and a customer support team that needs a serious upgrade 

Rockstar if youre listening its high time to fix these issues and give us the game we all deserve Disgusting company that doesnt respect its customers

GTA5 is a great game tbh and you can do whatever you want in here missions are good to only the oppressor kids are annoying af
TPI for life After years of wanting to play this game I finally robbed my countrys central bank to purchase it Now that our economy has tanked I can say it was worth it Im not sure about the online mode it was too overwhelming for me and I had RDR2 lined up which just seemed to be way more fun than this so I cant speak about it The singleplayer mode was amazing though coming from GTAIV there is a lot to love save for the unnecessarily violent cops

just try disable 2FA and you will see what a dogshit company is like u have to wait 2 days for a simple remove 2FA linki waited 4 and if u wait more then a day or two nope its invalid now so i guess ill go fuck myself
"Ive been playing GTAV on and off since it was first released and Ive been playing a lot more recently since they opened up most of the missions to play in a private session I basically stopped playing for a few years because it was impossible for me anyway to find a session where other players would moreorless leave me alone to do what I wanted to do Since they will now let me play most missions in a private session its been great If I could find a few friends to play with  a bit difficult for me as Im an old guy who plays mostly in the afternoons in the eastern United States  Id be interested in doing the Heists Oh well maybe one day 

The Story is much different from the Online play and both are fun I did finish the Story I didnt get every last achievement but thats okay and now I play almost exclusively online Note that this game deserves it Mature rating mostly for the language but also for some of the innuendo and some artifacts 

The game mechanics are great Id say theyre among the best Ive seen in any game It would be nice to see RockStar use the same mechanics in a different story in a different setting Hint hint

If you enjoy FPS games with varied missions and mission types open world play and great game mechanics  and you dont mind the language particularly in the Story version  I highly recommend this game"

"Fantastic open world game but on line is absolute trash
In my first 2 hours of on line playing I was in the tutorial and I had selected Passive Play because I only got on line to play some of the fantastic race tracks people have made
I was killed 3 times within 5 minutes by someone who magically drove through a cement wall into a clothing store while they had a God mode and began blowing everything up around us with an rpg and I saw his body go flying and immediately reappear where he originally shot from then he pointed it right at me and killed me then teleported to me when I respawned and did it again I had a Bounty on me by no one and was being tracked no matter what I did

Amazing single player game ABSOLUTE TRASH ON LINE PLAY"
ur mom
Stepping into GTA 5s gameplay world is like being thrust into a wild and chaotic adventure The freedom to explore a meticulously designed openworld city is exhilarating Whether Im cruising in a stolen car engaging in heartpounding shootouts or participating in meticulously planned heists every moment feels immersive The seamless characterswitching mechanic adds depth allowing me to experience the story from different perspectives And when Im not following the main plot theres a plethora of side activities from skydiving to golf ensuring Im never bored GTA 5s gameplay is a rollercoaster of action exploration and unexpected hilarity that keeps me hooked for hours on end

"My name is Walter Hartwell White I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque New Mexico 87104 This is my confession If youre watching this tape Im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw Hank Schrader Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist Shortly after my 50th birthday Hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world Connections that he made through his career with the DEA I was astounded I I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was thrown confused but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family Hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make And I was weak I didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed Every day I think back at that moment with regret I quickly realized that I was in way over my head and Hank had a partner a man named Gustavo Fring a businessman Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when I tried to quit Fring threatened my family I didnt know where to turn
Eventually Hank and Fring had a falling out From what I can gather Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which Fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated Fring was able to arrange uh I guess I guess you call it a hit on my brotherinlaw and failed but Hank was seriously injured and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over 177000 Upon recovery Hank was bent on revenge working with a man named Hector Salamanca he plotted to kill Fring and did so In fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it I have often contemplated suicide but Im a coward I wanted to go to the police but I was frightened Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me For 3 months he kept them My wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what I had done why Hank had taken our children We were scared I was in Hell I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family Recently I tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this I cant take this anymore I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me or worse hurt my family I All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is"
"This game is fun  I like it  But a recent update has rendered it unplayable for me

Before a recent update Linux and Windows support was flawless  Now Grand Theft Auto V is not playable for me on either Linux Proton or Windows native

On the former I experienced it occasionally loading and working other times it doesnt  It would often get past Processing Vulkan Shaders and then not launch the Rockstar Games Launcher  Some other times it would crash after the loading screen at about 23 stars in the topright  On very rare occasions after restarting Steam and letting Vulkan shaders process it would sometimes actually launch

For the latter it was fine until changing my graphics settings at which point the game loaded and played at less than 1fps where I was unable to change any settings back at all  On Linux with Proton which virtualizes the game I was usually around 7080fps  Main menu screens being impossible to navigate makes no sense here

A few hours from initially writing this review GTA Online is able to pass through all the loading screens but then immediately crashes when getting ingame  Fun

I understand that not all users will experience the aforementioned issues but it might be something to be wary of especially if you are looking into running the game through Proton

Along with those I still have some other gripes with the game

The menus also feel clunky and incomplete and some options are located in hard to find places

GTA Online lobbies are infested with cheaters all the time  going anywhere but a private or friends only session is simply not a fun experience

GTA Onlines loading times are also extremely long a lot of the time  sometimes taking 23 minutes to get into a lobby  This could be an internet issue but Id describe my internet to be pretty average and alright

This game is still fun once you get things going and I would like to recommend it if I was able to get it working a larger amount of the time  playing GTA Online with my friends is one of my favourite things to do an I enjoy even just being in a lobby and VC with them with eachother occasionally jumping in and bombing one another and everyone bursting into laughter

And even playing solo is still a fun experience at least for me stealing cars and shooting guns is fun

PS If anyone can help me fix my mentioned issues then feel free to reach out

EDIT Thought itd be worth mentioning
Intel i512400f
AMD RX 6600XT
16GB RAM

EDIT2 I have no idea what I did but it works now  I think its because Windows randomly decided to update and possibly did my graphics drivers  Could have been an issue with that  Still very strange"
its gooood
awesome
"The game is good somehow checkpoints work incorrectly by advancing the player to the next stage of the mission while the player fails on a previous stage
Graphics is stunning even at the end of 2023

Definitely recommend playing

PS Social club suck"
Is good thumbsup
good game
na
g00d
nothing that i can say just luv it
i love every bit of this game its what every game should be FUN
i am having trouble logging in with social and its telling me its having trouble automatically logging me in to my account using an email that is not mine nor exist because its fake and when i ask for support they ignore me
for a game made in 2013 its decent nothing outstanding and nothing too horrible a major issue for me though is that there are only 69 story missions and so i completed the story in 3 days

"Single player game  YES
GTA Online  NOOOOOO 

I have way more hours in GTAV than what is shown on my account as I have played since day 1 of its launch on other platforms Thats part of the problem Ill leave out the details but the reasons I say to avoid the online part is because its the most toxic multiplayer game in existence today It started out good when they stayed within the bounds of the GTA universe but once they introduced game breaking flying bikescarssubsnuclear missile heistsetc it was clear they only cared about the money 

Heists werent even in the game at first and when they did get put in they werent terribly unrealistic But thats when RockstarRS started their turn to greed and predatory shark card pushing They nerfed payouts for nearly everything while increasing the cost of everything in an attempt to slow down players getting too much money Players could buy stuff with all the money RS was paying out in missionsheists and that didnt make people need to buy shark cards So they just kept adding more stuff at ridiculous prices while also requiring ridiculous storage facilities for these new vehicles and you couldnt even do any new heists unless you owned a certain vehiclebusiness thus ultimately making the official grind to get these things a pita Or just as they expected people started buying shark cards to compensate for their time which just spiraled out of control into an unrealistic experience thats so out of touch with the original release RS just said oh well its a different universe that takes place before the events of single player BS The reason they havent made GTA6 sooner is because the cow still had a LOT of milk left 

I dont want the other companies seeing the success of RS as a sign to do the same treatment to their games Sure youll make money but youll lose a lot of players leading you to end up like RS pandering to whales that keep the game afloat"

great game have played the story mode 20 times on different platforms and have enjoyed it every time only downside is the multiplayer because it filled with modders
my daily release of dopamine includes running over innocent people watching the girl on the loading screen and finally last but not least the strip club sadly they removed the gay strip club though However it is most definitely a must buy
this fucking game is trash every time i play it wont let me so i am quitting GTA V forever
Amazing game

great game gta for life
GTA V and GTA Online with mods is definitely one of the best games on PC hands down I remember playing it on PS3 long before it made it to Steam and I have so many great memories of that time The modding capabilities it has now just make it that much more enjoyable Doing coop with my friends is such a blast and I dont think theres any other game on PC that can provide the same kind of experience as GTA V and GTA Online I highly recommend it to everyone who havent tried it yet and Im sure they wont be disappointed
so kewl

made me more suicidal than a ex r6 player
little boring but fun most of the time
Why I need to say something about this game quality Everyone knows already
Lots of replay value and addicting The grind for me is fun
good
really really fun game even online mode but as of late wayyy too many hackers and cheaters so you just have to get lucky with your server or use an invite only session which is no where near as fun one way to protect your self from the hackers is to download protection scrips and use them but probably not worth it if you only just bought the game as this game is like 50 aud so in short i dont recommend or condone hacking and also only get GTAV if you really really want it otherwise just wait for GTA 6 to come out I only said recommend because the game is still fun despite the hackers and whatnot
VERY VERY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD

"Grand Theft Auto V

Eng
Pluses
  Stunning graphics
  A game world open for research
  The ability to play the game simultaneously for several heroes
  Humor is one of the main advantages of GTA
  Improved artificial intelligence
  Many different types of weapons
  A fairly simple car control system
  Lots of different side quests
  Lots of new features

Minuses
  Minor bugs or sagging
  Minor graphics problems hanging textures or curved shadows
  Cities in such a huge game world are even more closed
  A running jump can end in death

Is it worth spending your time on the passage of Grand Theft Auto V Absolutely
365  5"
Garbage game spent all my time in loading screens and crashing The little time I got to spend in game was ruined by invincible hackers spawn killing me

"This only about online

You have 3 other friends and can play in private lobby  YES

I tried to play with random ppl in public lobby  give it two tries for aprox one month  dont have nerves for cheaters hackers spammers  so solo  NO

and last this is just a minor  but if you are in restricted country you have to use VPN to be able to use casino"
"My relationship with GTA V and GTA Online has been a real lovehate relationship The story mode is pretty great and feels like a Hollywood action movie at times and a dramedy at other times lots of hilarious dialogue and memorable characters gunplay is solid vehicles are fun Id definitely recommend GTA V to someone thats looking for a solid singleplayer game not to mention the availability of total conversion mods like LSPDFR which let you play as Police or Emergency Services in a semisimulator like way

GTA Online though I hate GTA Online but I also love it Its a great social game and a great way to kill time if youre playing with friends lots of ridiculous stuff is possible but playing solo definitely gets boring and repetitive pretty quick but still most of the 3300 hours Ive spent with the game have been GTA Online so they must be doing something right"
Good game just run people over

"The online game is filled with hackers and modders using godmode and other cheats to make the game unplayable for you When you attempt to report them they intercept those requests and block them they can then crash your gamespoof your name and in some reported caseseven get you banned for their activities because of the name spoofing 

Ive had my game crashed soo many times that its just not worth playing anymore You can grind the game all you want to try and experience the game further but someone can just take it all away from you in a heartbeat Rockstar does nothing to address these issues so the issue just continues to get worse 

There are nonstop advertisements in each online session for these modding websites and for purchasing insane amounts of in game money through them It would be so easy for rockstar to fix this but it must be more profitable for them to allow it to go on The only way to truly report players is from the rockstar social club where there is no guarantee your submissions are even reviewed  

If this is how rockstar handles their biggest cash cow how are we to expect GTA 6 to be any different"
Insane
I always enjoyed playing GTA from the beginning As a 80s baby I have watched the series do great things I love running through the story line it keeps you entertained and has tons of options I recently got into playing it online with some friends and have found the open world with a group to be a great set up for gameplay Im making everyone get online to play now so we have 3 or 4 crews running in one lobby Great way to spend the day

Overrated Im still surprised people even play online after the whole GTA fiasco and how rockstar only knows how to add stuff when it makes them money instead of focusing on the bigger problem at hand Cheaters every single lobby you go to is filled to the brim with some kid using his free trainer making it miserable for everyone I would talk about story mode but everyone nowadays buys GTA to play online so I wont bother

"Listen up you crazy bunch Grand Theft Auto V aint just a game its a fullon crazy ride thatll have your heart pounding like you just downed a jug of adrenaline Im talkin bout a world where you can hijack cars burn rubber like a maniac and unleash havoc like a bat outta hell And let me tell you its a damn blast

From the moment you dive into Los Santos youre smack dab in the middle of a chaotic playground thats fit for folks like me  misfits lunatics and downright insane individuals Michael Franklin and that wild card Trevor bring a whole new meaning to the word chaos and believe me things escalate pretty damn quick

You get behind the wheel of a stolen ride slam that gas pedal to the floor and the rush hits you like a shot of adrenaline straight to the veins And lets talk heists  planning and executing those with a bunch of screwballs by your side Its like conducting an orchestra of chaos and Im the goddamn conductor

Los Santos man This open world is a masterpiece of madness You got everything from pristine beaches to grimy back alleys all ready for your brand of mayhem And the attention to detail Its like they read my mind You can be a pilot go play some damn golf or raise hell in a strip club Its a world tailormade for a guy like me

The story Oh the story is a rollercoaster thatll throw you for loops you never saw coming Betrayal lunacy and plot twists thatll make your head spin And those random nutjobs you meet along the way Helping some wacko launch his druggedup submarine Yeah thats just another day in Los Santos

Graphics Sounds Radio stations pumping out twisted tunes Its like being inside a chaotic fever dream The only thing missing is the smell of burnt rubber and gunpowder And damn it I love every second of it Its like living out the craziest fantasies without the realworld mess

So if youre looking for a taste of the wild side if you want to dive headfirst into the lunacy and unpredictability then Grand Theft Auto V is your golden ticket Its a wild journey thatll have you grinning like a madman cursing at the screen and maybe questioning your sanity  all in the best way possible Embrace the madness you beautiful maniacs"

"the game itself has been fun but the online content today is just a shadow of its former self If you are a low level starter be prepared to be target practice by those who have spent far too long and amassed huge funds
so they can buy flying bikes and wipe you out in a second Preventing you from accomplishing the most simple mission to earn money and rep  This can be mitigated by playing solo so temper your expectations and dont overstretch and you should be fine"

for starters loading time is so long that you will most likely change your mind and switch to another game 
i also must add that the amount of times that ive been playing in a session then randomly getting disconnected is horrifying
i really hope rockstsar fixes these issues they most likely wont "

You should play this if you want to commit crimes against humanity or if you have mods like every other person
great
very good

Spend more time at the strip club that playing the actual game
Over 900 hours in this game and I wanna kill myself would recommend if the player base isnt full of degeneracy especially Sunday Griefers This masterpiece crashes when youd least expect it for example just driving around is enough to end your perfectly fine session On this journey I have opened Task Manager well above the average number in a life time because Rockstar Games is amazing
doggie ah game cant even join a game if you have any skill youll be kicked by modders instantly so I recommend a mod menu for kick protection among others protections

"I mean yeah its GTA V You know what this is you know if youll like it or not 

My only real complaint is that Im forced to download and store the entirety of GTA Online which I dont play This makes the entire install over 100gb which is not cool"
mutilating your balls is better than gta online
i hate it
BEsmillah rahman rahim veri goodt gamm
kill me
had to deliver 15 packs of weed in 30 minutes via water plane and theres hardly any time for it i had 6 parcels left and 5 minute when my game froze for maybe the first time ever at least the way it did because it didnt stop responding on the computer it just quit moving and after about 15 seconds it closed itself with no crash report or anything youd think a game that took 8 years to make and has had 10 years of updates afterward would be as dysfunctional as GTA V yet here it is
JOD

Nothing but a greedy company making a desperate effort anymore Modders wreck lobbies without consequence random people get banned daily and nothing ever gets fixed Save your money and wait another decade for the sixth installment
its a fun and good game to play if you like story line and also free play

criminal simulator
"welp i must say the Story is alright i guess i liked it but well i did not find it that interesting i guess but the gameplay is a 1010 for me

Now to Online 
Online is kinda hard to play as a new player because of the god damn Flying bikes but its good with friends even more good like i love it but be warned of hackers in every two lobbys

Sorry for bad English im german and to Lazy to care"
The fifth main entry in the GTA series is very much more of the same type of gameplay and story that were used to now in a somewhat fresh setting That said my main complaint is that there isnt more of it as completing the main questline left me feeling I still had much to explore but no incentive to actually do so I suppose the idea is to play online but as someone with little patience for multiplayer outside my circle of friends I would have liked more single player content even if they were autogenerated missions 60 hours is still a decent playtime though especially for a game that goes on sale a lot so pick this up if you havent already

Amazing story and game play I love it
good good goooooooooooooooood
When i played GTA 5 Fivem Its a great game Nice fucking game Rock ON
goooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD GAME
Its an amazing game if you just want to be a badass then this is the game for you

 No
I always love this game

Kinda copied watch dogs 2 but its all good

"Love this game Spent so much time on it playing on xbox and playing on PC is even better

online the goat but my starter pack i bought didnt receive it so dont recommend buying criminal enterprise starter pack without contacting staff at rockstar but i made all the money i wouldve had because i did heist and jobs and missions but uh yes
best game ever
Its cool but it takes long to load
One of if not the greatest story game I have EVER played
a free world to ruin with no consequences

its fun kill evry one

"I just want to say that this game is not bad 
I do not like the two of the three protagonists Trevor and Michael There are too much driving in this game and its kind of boring"
"Rockstar support sucks
I got suspended and they will delete my charachter that i spent over 230 hours on and  there is nothing i can do about it and there is no reason that rockstart has to suspend me so if youre planning to buy gta v Never kill anyone in online because they will get pissed and report you and also you have to read the terms of serveice 50 times before you start the game so that you can be at least 30 sure that you will not get suspended But you will most likely get suspended anyway because the staff were probably bored or something

I relly like the game but the support is just horrible"
wgame
13 of the player base is hacking
Best game to have fun watch out for griefers
im never getting my drivers license
This is an amazing game However Rockstar on the other hand is abysmal and makes a shitty social club launcher that doesnt work half the time and somehow manages to lose your 200hr account prevented you from logging into the game until you go through a multiple day support process to MAYBE get it back and just for that I would say dont buy this game and dont support a shit company
"well After 27448 hours of game play i can officially say that this game is complicated   The actual game itself single player  is great  The online version though while the most fun version of GTA its also completely over run with modders  I would say that Rockstar has completely lost control of their online modebut i think its by design and they want the modders to play more then actual players  I have reported HUNDREDS of modders and nothing ever is done about  at this point I give up  The online world of GTA is lost to the modders

After 274489 hours I struggle to recommend this game  It has some great moments and fun gameplay but the online version too many modders  hackers just ruins the whole of it

sad rock star wont do anything about this  play at your own risk i recommend single player or solo lobby for online"
glizzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzy edit i play every day
its the best game in my opinion
perfect
im a racist and i love this game

Very good game

OK
good game
Personally I Reccomend the Game its story is Great some romance like Trevor being interested in a old lady and or A 3bit gangster Killing one of his mates other than that the  Online feature its alright easy to rage at because of flying bikes with missiles for christs sake and or just the average Military grade Jet fuckers Flying themselves into the ground like a Japanese pilot in the wars
lklklk
Game has people with almost no clothing 1010

fire game even after 200 years
it is great
American Dream Comes True
so my friends got me into the game a long time ago they dont play anymore do you know who does play the guy who spam killed the sessions members and i was being blamed for it 2 minutes later rockstar blocked my account im on a steam deck is that even capable of hacking gta online was a good 130 hours while it lasted though seemed like everyone used me as a pin cushion for bullets explosions and telling me to KMSthis was a popular message going out i dont know why ppl say warcraft is toxic they dont manipulate the game into making me the villain cool story mode wish i couldve gotten into online mode some more before my IP was blocked

i like it
Fun
mast game hai
Used to love the game and still do This game unfortunately is practically unplayable Unless you play the Story you will be met with modders who will grief you every 1015 minutes delaying any progress in the game If you think playing in an invite only session is safe think again Modders are able to do almost anything now control your character cage you constantly kill you it makes the game unplayable Ive put probably 500 hours in this game between console and pc and Ive come to the conclusion that GTA V on PC is just unplayable now and not worth the hours upon hours it takes to accomplish anything now
this game i dont cant play again
great
i need steam points pls donate
Nothing more fun than fucking around in this game or playing heist with friends

"Grand Theft Auto V GTA V is an extraordinary masterpiece that stands as a testament to the openworld actionadventure genre With its sprawling meticulously crafted game world engaging storyline and endless opportunities for mayhem GTA V offers an unparalleled experience that continues to captivate players years after its release

Set in the fictional city of Los Santos a stunning reimagining of Los Angeles GTA V introduces players to a trio of protagonists Michael a retired bank robber seeking a new life Franklin a streetsavvy hustler looking to escape his surroundings and Trevor a volatile and unpredictable criminal The characterswitching mechanic allows players to seamlessly switch between these three individuals adding depth to the narrative and offering unique perspectives on the games unfolding events

One of the most remarkable aspects of GTA V is its breathtakingly detailed open world Los Santos is a living breathing entity teeming with activities NPCs and surprises around every corner From towering skyscrapers to sunsoaked beaches the citys diverse environments offer a sense of immersion that is truly aweinspiring The games attention to detail whether in the bustling city streets or the vast countryside is a testament to Rockstars dedication to creating a rich and vibrant game world

The storyline of GTA V is a rollercoaster of heists betrayals and unexpected alliances The interwoven narratives of Michael Franklin and Trevor provide an engaging and wellpaced experience that keeps players invested in the outcome The writing is sharp darkly humorous and often satirical tackling social and political issues with a dose of Rockstars signature irreverence

Gameplay in GTA V is a harmonious blend of action driving and exploration The sheer variety of activities is staggering  from highstakes heists and intense shootouts to leisurely sports races and even simple pastimes like golf and tennis The driving mechanics are polished and responsive and the wide array of vehicles each with its own distinct handling adds to the immersive experience

GTA Online the games multiplayer component extends the life of GTA V even further It provides a massive openworld playground for players to engage in coop missions competitive modes and openended chaos with friends or strangers The constant updates and additions keep the experience fresh and exciting offering an everevolving online world to explore

Graphically GTA V still holds up remarkably well showcasing intricate details in character models vehicles and environments The games soundtrack radio stations and voice acting are all topnotch contributing to the overall atmosphere and immersion

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a masterclass in openworld gaming combining an engaging narrative a vibrant and diverse game world and a plethora of activities that cater to every type of player Its longevity is a testament to its enduring appeal and even years after its initial release GTA V remains an essential title that stands as a shining example of Rockstar Games unparalleled craftsmanship"

GOOD
ok
i love this game plus mods 
vvn cakda shtoa veeka re they home yet vychislav natoolia rockyyy no
great
This is probably one of the most packed games of all time filled to the brim with dlc and then when it eventually gets boring after thousands of hours you can try amazing mods that unlock tons of more content such as gta rp through fivem and story mods that change the story completely and the way the graphics look

"Howdy reader let me state that this review is only for the single player  story mode experience

To be to the point this game is good not fantastic it could have been fantastic if some elements were different even so  I think you should play it if you havent already its a fun ride

The main reason why this game is not amazing is because it lacks depth depth in story in characters and the world surrounding it the idea of having three protagonists is quite revolutionary for a triple A game taking that into consideration we needed more for every main character especially for Franklin
Why not use secondary missions to expand on these characters Their mindsets their history their relationships with other individuals I wanted to understand them better I perceived the mcs I just wanted to get more out of these three
I wanted to get a clearer picture of Franklins hood life his bond with Lamar with his ex with his childhood friends there was enough structure for that to happen instead what we got was futile missions who are mostly running jokes or their existence is there only to get a mechanic from the game which is fine  we can have those but we need the build up missions also they are essential for a story based game such as this one
I hoped to view additional content of Michaels family life to spend time with Jimmy Tracey Amanda theyre nice kids and I disliked the fact that we went with the full on stereotype characters
Same for Trevor I craved to watch into his head so to speak  to make proper sense out of him
My point is this game is too short and its short for the reason that we have too many meaningless missions that do not shape your protagonists those quests are forgettable

You feel like a ragdoll at times due to the fact that the physics are quite strange the controls for helicopters airplanes parachutes and so on are kind of bad on the keyboard you get used to it though it can be irritating once in a while
GTAs V universe its detailed same for the map yet much of the side content its rather shallow sure you can do yoga play tennis golf and whatever only most of the players with ignore those activities for half of the game if not for the entire game keep those inside the game but you also need features to have actual entertainment to follow because it feels natural to follow since you enjoy it
Radio stations required diversity in the music genres once more its good it could have been superior  perhaps is my taste I dont know however across the majority of the stations on every channel I liked what Usually two songs
Im only saying they were deficient in quality music in my opinion and you need quality music since half of the activities will be inside a vehicle
You can say more though who wants to read this much

8  10"
A lot of good things in this game The hours are basically all from singleplayer mods and such i have almost 900 hours on ps4 and man the online has only gotten worse I played a little bit of vanilla online on PC and its also pretty bad If you really wanna give this game a try find some friends to play with ESPECIALLY early on and stick with them playing this game solo is a miserable experience
Yes It cured my Sheldon copper disorder

STILL THE BEST GAME TO EXIST
I hate the hookers in this game need more animation

very fun
honestly its fun
One of the best games if you like a good story
The game is fun until you want to do business cargo runsselling items and then a dude with the sole purpose of griefing you will hunt you down and ruin your fun Every server has one or 2 of these people as well as the many hackers modders in the game who also are in at least 1 or 2 people per server Get rid of the mk2  make the game good again
I like the cheats
Great game for adults
Play this game but look out for modders
Best Game ever
hackers make or ruin ur gamebut I got sum contacts

i dont like the game
If you want this game to play online wait for GTA 6 Everytime you join a lobby you either get obliterated by every hack known to man or you get given EVERYTHING ruining proggression and your entire experience Rockstar does not care about pc players and wont be any help In this games defense though the actual game is enjoyable its just unplayable
"Cant play GTA 5 due to the one of the worse antialiasing in any game Ive ever seen Max graphics max antialiasing 2k res flickering everywhere Annoys my eyes

In my opinion one of the best open world games ive ever played Tons of content Instead of following an obligated set path of missions like most other games you have 100 choice on which path you take right from the beginning I got hooked from day 1 and have yet to be bored Thats my review for online since I havent gotten far in story mode

As it is now though with modern hardware and windows 11 the game is pretty much unplayable with frequent stutters and crashes never got optimized down the road at all
Pretty mad about it too since I really wanted to replay the single player again before diving into multiplayer but no such luck  at crash number 68 within 24 hours of starting a new game "

"It was fun at first
But its the opposite of the gift that keeps on giving It just gets worse and worse
The game is full of cheaters is basically unplayable online Every update the devs remove something else making the game dull and boring 
I you are stuck with this game try playing alone and explore a bit The game has some nice visuals"
YAY

If you delay GTA6 one more time
GOOD GAME
I got ban
fun and a lot of things to do
should be aged for 1100 very child like game
its gta 5 what more must I say
car go fly
niggas
online servers are kinda messed with hackers but you can negate this in settings by running an invite only lobby
has a very big inflasin rate in gta5on
Its a fun game though can be challenging to start up due to how long its been out with so much to do  Youll have to start out in the single player version of online to make money doing open world deliveries and such as the public lobbies can be fun but chaotic and people will prevent you from making money
GOOD
Bad guy simulator Very fun
monekyssssssssssssssssssssss
Pls play it Its an awesome game

NICE
Good game but its rough starting as a beginner in online mode Quite overwhelming if I didnt have a friend to guide me I feel like there should be a bit more tutorials to help you get started Other than that I would highly recommend
it cool bro
Amanda is a little shit
This shit sucks
Rockstars are basically cons artists they have no support whatsoever they charge you each time you buy their games put you in their Social Club where those morons have no clue to keep an account secured

"Im likely less typical type of player as I enjoy exploration more than violence but here GTA 5 shines too as I loved moving through different city districts and nature zones exploring the buildings ads infrastructure wildlife and random conversations 

And for me GTA 5 seems as a great compression of Southern California with its top features represented from city to rural life and to expansive nature 

Loved GTA Online too as got some free money together with my purchase which allowed me to customize my game lifestyle with looks properties and vehicles which I used with friend to showcase our customizations to each other 

Vert fun"
crime
good game but cussing and not allowed for 11 and under
It was decent
car
It took a long time before this game was in a state that I could enjoy in a long term Its progressively gotten much more playable for solo players and for a game that advertises itself as the ultimate crime simulator this game is oddly relaxing to play and just grind when you need some peace and quiet Its a classic game that I would highly recommend
GREAT GAME

"Title A Magnificent Urban Playground  Grand Theft Auto V Review

Rating  55

Grand Theft Auto V GTA V stands as a monumental achievement in the realm of openworld gaming offering an incredibly detailed and sprawling virtual representation of a vibrant and chaotic metropolis Rockstar Games masterpiece released in 2013 continues to captivate players with its intricate storytelling diverse characters and an expansive sandbox environment that pushes the boundaries of what an openworld game can achieve

From the moment you step into the sunsoaked streets of Los Santos it becomes apparent that GTA V is an exercise in worldbuilding perfection The city is alive with an abundance of activities and attractions that cater to a wide range of play styles Whether youre an adrenaline junkie looking to engage in highspeed police chases a strategic planner orchestrating elaborate heists or simply an explorer soaking in the urban sprawl GTA V offers something for everyone

The games narrative is a tour de force interweaving the stories of three protagonists  Michael Franklin and Trevor  whose lives and ambitions intersect in unexpected ways The character development is exceptional and Rockstars storytelling prowess is on full display as they delve into the complexities of their personalities backgrounds and motivations Each character is fully realized making it easy to invest emotionally in their individual journeys

great

"its fun
but the modes be overusing they powers n shi ngl"
"Back when I got this game it was fun Adventures with friends heists and missions that you could do alone when friends were offline Now its a buggy mess Missions cant be completed it keeps failing to connect to servers hackers galore you name it Theres a new game breaking bug every time I play now and I find myself restarting the game 5 times a night 

Stop milking this game and dont put any more money into Rockstar until they provide something thats actually worth a damn Its 10 years old Rockstar move on GTA Online is a terrible excuse for a gaming product and you cant even keep control of it anyway"
"If real life had cheat codes Id totally enter GTA V mode every morning Who needs a snooze button when you can hijack a helicopter to work right This game turns Los Santos into a playground for chaos enthusiasts and traffic law critics Just remember in GTA V jaywalking isnt a crime  its a way of life Watching NPCs drive is like witnessing a symphony of car crashes

Pros
 Open world More like open pandemonium
 Robbing virtual banks 1010 would felonize again
 Traffic jams are for quitters skydiving onto moving cars is where its at
 NPCs with the driving skills of a brick on roller skates  unintentional comedy gold
 Invaded by the Cops TV show Just pay your virtual therapist with virtual money

Cons
 Cops magically teleporting to your location surprise party or police state
 Accidentally punching the air while trying to enter a car  my characters new interpretive dance move
 Radio DJs yes Im still here and yes I can still hear you

Verdict
If life gives you lemons make a ramp and jump a stolen car into the sunset GTA V is a masterpiece of mayhem where obeying traffic laws is merely a suggestion So put on your helmet grab a rocket launcher and let the anarchy begin"
worst
Love the sandbox game play and being able to drive multiple machines commit crimes and have fun all from the comfort of home
Fun
yay cool gun go boom
Rockstar automaticly logged me out of my social club account and now i cannot play the game anymore My steam account is supposedly linked with an email i have no clue about WHY
fun
I have to say its fun pvp till he pulls the common free mod menu BUT when you get called a hacker its worth all the money 1010 would play for another 500h
Great game
god
grand theft auto
its a good game overall
The ability to run all of your businesses in a private lobby is not something that should be ignored Its great I dont have to deal with any sort of griefers just my asshole friends

very good pew pew
h
punching civilians is my favorite passtime activity
best game ever
Rockstar knows how to make you play a game
its the best game in the world
fuck you
"For me Grand Theft Auto Vs extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments One is from a midgame mission in which I flew a plane into another plane fought the crew hijacked the thing and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets Another time whilst driving around in an offroad buggy I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains Turns out it was a path and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit where I nearly ran over a group of hikers Typical one of them yelled at me as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike

I could go on like this for ages GTA V has an abundance of such moments big and small that make San Andreas  the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas  feel like a living world where anything can happen It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly wellrealised world and tells a story thats gripping thrilling and darkly comic It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series and theres no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasnt been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV Its immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the autoaim less touchy The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts And at long last Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons mission checkpointing ensuring that you never have to do a long tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again"

This game is really amazing and i am playing this game from last 6 years and never felt it was old and whenever i go for new pc or consoles The first game i get with it is gta V
I lost nearly 2k hours on Role Play
Online sucks ass
this game sucks
If you can get through the ass pain of having to go through rockstars bullshit then youll already know this game is GOATed whether you play it on PC or Console youll have a great time However for PC players  dont forget your shit cause rockstar will go through more girlfriends than you before they help you out in recovering your account

"3k hours grinding online and 3k hours role playing I dont regret it 
Waiting for GTA 6 and hoping it will expand on how much we can do to customize and personalize our cars tunes car accessories lift kits drift kitstuning specific engine upgrades Also hoping fueling cars and turning signals would be a thing in GTA 6 too

Also I really loved the setup camp feature from RDR2 and hope something like this would be implemented to GTA 6 be it chairs tents a rug maybe

The most fun we had in this game is spending time with your friends in a private lobby Hosting offroad events with our SUVs and Pickup trucks camping and telling stories near the river around a campfire Golden memories"

"I have been a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series for years and Grand Theft Auto V absolutely exceeded my expectations This game offers an unparalleled openworld experience that keeps you hooked from the very beginning

The first thing that struck me was the incredibly detailed and immersive world of Los Santos The city is bustling with life from the diverse pedestrians going about their business to the stunning landscapes that seamlessly blend urban and natural environments Every street corner has its own story to tell making exploration an absolute joy

The characters in GTA 5 are some of the most memorable and welldeveloped in gaming history Michael Franklin and Trevor each bring their own unique personalities and backgrounds to the table creating a perfect dynamic within the storyline The voice acting and character animations are topnotch making every interaction feel genuine and engaging

What truly sets GTA 5 apart is its storytelling The intertwining narratives of the three protagonists keep you invested in every twist and turn of the plot The missions are diverse and exciting ranging from highoctane heists to heartwarming moments that reveal the characters deeper sides The writing is sharp witty and often satirical offering both thoughtprovoking social commentary and laughoutloud humor

The attention to detail in Grand Theft Auto V is astounding From the realistic physics and driving mechanics to the bustling traffic and pedestrians the world feels alive in every way Whether youre engaging in a highspeed chase participating in a street race or simply soaking in the beautiful sunset over the ocean the level of immersion is unparalleled

And lets not forget about GTA Online The multiplayer aspect of the game adds a whole new layer of fun and competition Whether youre teaming up with friends for heists or engaging in wild and creative game modes theres always something new to explore and experience

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece that has set a new standard for openworld gaming Rockstar Games has once again delivered an unforgettable experience that combines gripping storytelling stunning visuals and boundless opportunities for exploration If youre looking for a game that will keep you entertained for hours on end GTA 5 is an absolute mustplay"
The game has recently been very slow and glitchy mechanic doesnt allow me to select the cars i want delivered i cant enter my maze bank officegarage or custom shop always stuck on black screen forever when doing so

fun on linux but playing with friends is hard

"h1First Lookh1

As for me lets say Iim not incredibly fond of quite like any shooter gamesuch as Fortnite CS GO etcI because of them having pretty much only two main goals Shoot any opponent on sight and survive yourself which with time become just oblivious But you would say if so then bIWhy am I recommending the game thenIb Its quite simple b 
IBecause GTA5 is NOTHING like those shooter gamesIb This fact is due to GTA being an IOpen  World GameI which means that you not necessarily have to run around and shoot anyone aimlessly but you can also progress in the storyline of the game itself in Story Mode or collaborate with  other player in quite any mission in Online for example buy and resell cars etc

This game is very inconsistent with its over all performance I dont know if this happens to anyone else but this game has been stuttering so bad for a few years now to the point where its completely unplayable Ive tried all the ways to fix this stuttering issue like trying to lower my graphics settings uninstalling and reinstalling the game deleting all the files restarting my computer and using external apps to lower the Graphics settings and even more and none of that worked I wouldnt recommend buying the game because you may face the issues im currently having

"This is probably the worst GTA I ever played
The Story Mode is plainly boring Many missions have bad design  go to another side of the city like I have nothing better to do Rewards for sidemissions are not exciting Trevors character is seemingly stolen from Kane and Lynch
GTA Online was bugged for me the game doesnt consider a tutorial finished and thus I dont have any job or activity"
10 yo game btw
a game does not get any better
when the cheating gets SO BAD they shut down your game with their mods GTA online is a fucking joke I only play out of SHEER BOREDOM

"Will Change if Ever Fixed

Well I got this game a while ago
I loved playing it for about a year
I got into the Online game world
Went to serve in the military
Come home my accounts been stolen
Never was able to get it back
Very frustrated Want to play with friends even today Cant fix the account cant change the account key cant buy a second copy lost all my progress and my stuff with my friends

Tried to fix it in vain more than once over months of waiting and checking

Due to their data breach had to go over all my other accounts found my personal data out on the net still havent gotten my account back

1010 Great Game horrible Life Decision in hindsight Stopped buying Rockstar games as result But would play again if I could ever figure out how besides rebuying the damn game"

"great game to have fun and play online with your friends
took me only 16 hours to complete the story
i dont regret it"
game used to be amazing when playing online hackers make it nonenjoyable however and even dangerous for your computer
Dont buy this game Rockstar the game devs do not care about your accounts security If your social club account gets hacked like mine did then you cant play the game at all it doesnt allow you to sign into another social club account and play even though you bought the game on steam with your steam account Therefore youre just stuck with a copy of gta that you cant play because you no longer have access to the social club account you used it with And to put the cherry on top the social club account you use to play is linked to your steam account so do what you want with that information but i wouldnt recommend wasting your money on a nearly ten year old game thatll allow just whoever to come and take all your personal information

Great Game
Game is unplayable due to online hackers that put you into small cages limiting your movement and forcing you to logoff and back in to only have it happen again in an endless loop To add insult to injury steam refused my refund because I played 3 hours instead of the 2 hour cutoff even though I literally just  bought the stupid broke game few hours ago
its gta what can u say

After thousands of hours on ps3  ps4 and multiple purchases of this game over the years for various reasons once again in 2023 I didnt think twice about purchasing gta5 for the 6th and final time on pc So yeah I highly recommend Grand Theft Auto 5
lamar is black jesus
good good ya

very bad service from steam if you want to download gta 5 please dont waste your money here go somewhere else
nice game
YOOOO THE BEST GAME EVERRRRRR
i love the game
"Basic openworld game with SO MUCH to do  Missions collections hundreds of vehicles to drive dozens of weapons varied terrain huge open world to explore This game is just so much  I especially love the crazy talk radio and the soundtrack takes me back in time  

The only real complaint I have about this game is that all the characters are unlikable  I really dislike all 3 playable characters because theyre all bad people  To an extent thats unavoidable in a game centered around theft and assassinations  Still it would be nice to have just 1 character whos not awful"
Very funny
its the best game i have ever played i just has that vibe
0 Stars GTA used to be a really good franchise but R has proven their incompetence by an absolute lack of attention to fixing bugs or preventing hacks Most recently none of the in game menus work so youre unable to complete missions call for vehicles or utilize anything that isnt on the in game phone Loading still takes obscenely forever even for a 10 year old game That is when it actually does load between whatever areas it has to load Too often you end up staring at a garage door trying to walk into a garage area or playing cloud simulator waiting for a load back into the world from a race or mission  Instead of fixing issues like this which have plagued the game from DAY 1 R has instead focused on bringing new characters missions vehicles and weapons into the game It doesnt matter how much content the game has if its not playable Even when the game is running properly online griefers run rampant with glitchers hackers and exploiters to prevent even simple enjoyable gameplay It always deteriorates into a PvP match instead of an openended world where people can play together R has never bothered to institute server options to prevent PvP outside of a ghost mode which makes it impossible for you to wield weapons thereby impossible to complete missions Yes nobody can kill you in this mode but you cant play the game either R has ruined what used to be an amazing immersive series with an endless quest for profit
Best storyline
A game set in an alternate reality where children dont exist

"GTA Online is very inspiring

You will meet some of the most braindead shtstink God awful people in this game

If you ever feel like you arent a good person or are just not happy with yourself its always a good idea go hop onto gta online and see how far from rock bottom you are"
Good gameplay and story works well even on a low end system

هذه اللعبة ممتعة  ولكن ليس لمن يؤمنون بالله  فهذه اللعبة لا تحتوي على معايير الكتاب المقدس  لأنها تحتوي على عنف وجشع ومحتوى جنسي  ولكنها قد تكون مسلية إذا اخترت ما تريد أن تراه شيئا أن يكون مناسبا  ولكن في رأيي  لا يتم تقييم كل شيء تقريبا في هذه اللعبة على أنه وقت مرور جيد لمن يؤمن بالمسيح  الابن الوحيد للأب

"My friend who I play Grand Theft Auto Online with said if I post a review on Grand Theft Auto V and it gets 100 likes and 20 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here
















Update For those wondering if I received the drinks YES PEOPLE I GOT THEM along with some chips too It took a while to get the drinks because were broke af but hey I got them few days later after I posted this We never expected people to interact with this because the idea is just crazy to our surprise it even exceeded our expectations I also want to thank everybody for interacting and my friend for keeping his promise I could never do it without you guys We will never forget this legendary wholesome moment maybe when I have the money I should pay him back with some drinks

About the game its really fun with friends especially when you have a lot of crazy things to do Los Santos has brought me so many unforgettable memories"

Poor game hackers everywhere when I report them game crashed
love this game
best game known to man kind
Got banned cause game is dumbjk its very fun
good game
ive hd to reintall this about 7 times and still dosnt work
Best openworld game ever
everything
gooodddd
its good
Very good game if you play with mods
"its a fun game with a 1010 story When you play online you will join in a public lobby with prob a griefer or 2 but i would to make money go in a private session invite only when you get further in online it gets more fun because you are able to buy more fun things to mess around with and give payback to the ppl who griefed you when you were tryna figure out how to make your first bit of money

Overall
Story really good but gets repetitive in my opinion but fun when you play with mods mods dont work in online
Online early game in public sucks grindy midlate game it is fun"
You get out of your 9 to 5 tired from work drive back home check your phone for messages or emails and you feel like getting on your PC but instead you just head to bed Finally you log off GTA Online

Full of hackers who wont let you play the game Rockstar seems least interested in doing anything about it Even with good net and system requirements the game take forever to forever to load Only few times it gets loaded but evene with that it has tons of bugs ingame and obviously hackers to ruin your gameplay
excellent game highly recommend 55 stars
gooffy
Bw the beat game ever i played Thanks Rockstar
You who never had to chanse play this would recomend but  nah you all are just 12 years olds
very good worth it for money
good ganme
I dont know what to say other than its a fun game that doesnt follow many of the rules that other games are ensnared within I dont know many people my age who play this game but If your grandfather says that people his age dont play games like gta v tell him thats why old folks get a reputation for being delicate  I havent figured out most of the control details yet but it hasnt stopped me from completing missions so far  I tried to write something useful here but I think I am going to keep playing and try this again later when I have accumulated more experience
i like this game it made me smarter

I loved the game still do Played it when i was younger and in high school would not recommend getting on digital unless its from a third party that bypasses the rockstar launcher and epic As it stands The company has made it more difficult to play the game online as well as to just play the standard campaign without a login gatekeep get the ps4 or ps3 version and check out the community modding scene to get your moneys worth
i swear i just bought this game about 3 weeks ago
Great game till now i highly recommend it

"Firstly i wanna say that Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece Story gameplay characters details nature Everything just everything was incredible Unforgettable experience that was 

BUT

The online part was the pain in the ass I mean everything was fine the missions was fun and challenging But i dont understand how they cant prevent this cheats in the game its so annoying But u know what the saddest part about it Not the failed missions because of cheaters not the despair feeling The saddest part is that this humans who uses cheats are mentally ill and i think that they need to get help Because its really not a normal behavior

I hope that Grand Theft Auto 6 would be prepared for this cheaters Good luck Rockstar"

"h1Singleplayerh1
The singleplayer is great The missions are fun and hold up well after all these years I think the problem is the story The protagonists are great but the antagonists leave a lot to be desired There isnt a villain like Dmitri Rascalov Officer Tenpenny Dutch or Micah Its a more vague thing like Michaels problems So you hop from minor antagonist to minor antagonist until the story ends because Michaels arc is finally completed Im not sure it works from a climatic point of view
The gameplay feels evolved from GTA IV the animations are much smoother the graphics are better the world overall feels more sophisticated and more populated there is simply just more content This is not without its drawbacks however Some things have been scaled down like the physics simulations in shooting and driving and the damage model to cars I dont know if it was due to game performance or not but since this game was made for the PS3 I guess they couldnt fit all the new things without taking some old things out first

h1Onlineh1
The online is very fun with friends If you play in a public session you can count on some griefing some hacking giving you money so R bans you some funny guy crashing your game but if you play private sessions with friends its very enjoyable 
I like exploring all the content added to the game over the course of these 10 years The first heists are a bit dated now but the Casino Heist Doomsday and Cayo Perico are great It shows R learned what works and what doesnt
But you dont need these things to have fun I enjoy doing things like Top Geartype challenges in places where you dont really go in the story so you have a lot to explore before you feel like you need to buy expansion content

h1Microtransactionsh1
GTA Online has these microtransactions called shark cards People complain the expansions are very grindy because they feel R wants you to buy them I agree It feels like they made them with the following options in mind
 A Buy a shark card so you purchase the propertycaretc and its upgrades  the expansion is fun and yields good ingame money so you can buy more things and have more fun
 B Grind to purchase the thing then grind some more so you can purchase the upgrades which make the property profitable not as fun

Same thing with cars and houses In Midnight Club LA R sold car packs for 299 now they sell cars for a million GTA This gives you the option to pay with your time instead of only your wallet

Nobody tells you about this its very subconscious If R went with option A and sold the expansionsDLC on the side people wouldnt complain but they probably wouldnt care either or call the game P2W so I feel like it worked out okay"
dis gejm gud evrivan bay it
I made Michael look like Andrew Tate when his wife left him so he could get on his sigma grindset and win her back I wish you could have done the same thing with Franklin and his girl but shes messing with some brain surgeon or lawyer or something She was black anyways so I got him a schizophrenic white girl that eats dry wall and soil

This game is pretty bad honestly If youre buying this game to play online  Just dont I have almost 100 hours on this game and it takes literal hours to get a match for missions going  Theres modding everywhere Its really only worth the money for the story Rockstar games is way past their prime and it clearly shows when you see their newest content

"GTA V a 10yearold game still manages to blow my mind with its incredible visuals

The city of Los Santos looks stunning with vibrant colors and attention to detail that rivals modern games Rockstars dedication to updating and enhancing the game has kept it fresh For a game thats been around for a decade GTA Vs graphics are still great

If you havent played it yet youre missing out on a visually captivating experience that stands strong even today"
nice game
awesome foursome

Its a really fun game to play and all the missions are really fun its very realistic
Is it even needed to look into reviews for this game

OP
"changed my life in 2015
playing it as an adult is cool too theres a lot of interesting commentary thats still pretty relevant in 2023

theres weekly updates and theyve always released dlc for no extra cost after the games initial success "
mmmm
it can stop responding and not load sometimes but i love it to much
if you can look past all the grinding sometimes this game is very fun a must play with friends

i love it
I wanted to try it again after a few years the stupid link acounts and passwords are fucking dumb and stupid i cant play the game i buy anymore great job rockstar your obsesion for having our info ruins the experience
awesome game
ubo
cool
This game is one of the worst games you can buy It seems fun and at times can be but the amount of bs anyone has to get through to get to the fun parts is insanely too much If you are lucky enough to load in before 30 mins of failed attempts not my network you will then get to try calling the mechanic to bring you one of the cool cars you bought and that vital menu freezes 50 of the time So players must get to their garages to use their cars and go do missions and PLAY THE GAME and 60 of the time you load into a building or garage your game gets stuck in a loading loop If you are lucky you can press alt f4 or tab out a few times and then load in or just restart your game and the porcess entirely And if you somehow are driving around in your sick car doing a mission or just cruising you have 30 seconds before a hacker or a mk2 oppressor kid explodes you and then continues to explode you until you leave the session or go passive mode which then you cant use any of the parts of the game that are fun Or it will be a hacker on an oppressor I have had a lot of fun on this game but it has caused so much frustration and wasted so much of my time just on loading screens SAVE YOUR MONEY buy a simpler game or one not made by rockstar or get a better hobby than video games
GREAT BEST GTA5 on

"I do not recommend this if you play for online mode Ive been a gta player for over 12 years on console who now moved to pc and Ill say one thing for sure THIS GAME SUCKS the anticheat is terrible and the only reason people cheat on this game is to be a prick or to get money because rockstar refuses to make their game playable to a degree that is good for casual players this game has been and always will be terrible and a shit place to spend your time heres a few problems I have with it

1 Its impossible to be in a public lobby there is almost no conceivable way to be in a public lobby without some jackass using or advertising their shitty mod menu a example is a guy named Ineludible who is always advertising their scam malware mod menu and crashing and or killing you every time you call him out for trying to scam people or steal their info

2 Rockstar wants you to buy shark cards I have believed that rockstar has pushed their shitty version of a pay to win system forever they purposely make jobs underpay and heists too hard to grind because they need you to buy their micro transactions and I fully believe gta 6 will be exactly the same because go figure rockstar does not give a rats ass about keeping this game nice and playable they just want to milk it dry and I know that for a fact because as someone who played on console for ages I got excited over little things like a tire falling off your car if it got hit to hard but rockstar wont ever start caring because gta is just a cash grab to them

3 the players the playerbase is some of the most toxic and hard to put up with people ever between the griefing modding and just exploiting theyre horrible and they almost always use some lame ass excuse youre meant to kill other players or its in the game for a reason it doesnt excuse the players to be as shit as they are you get little to nothing from ruining someones hard work yet they still do because they are terrible people and rockstar refuses to ban these people because theyre just more money holes to be used not to mention the fact that rockstar denies making lobbies where you can play most things solo because you need more people from the bottom of my heart I hate this game and Im sure rockstar does too"
Really good game so many fucking cheaters online tho im having flashbacks to warzone
funny

amazing story mode is a 9510 the only bad part is gta 6 is never gonna pass it
i can kill people
i would rather hit my nuts with an acid dipped spiked baseball bat than get griefed on here by level 7000s and modders every game i load into a game the titanic is either floating around in the sky or im getting nonstop killed by an opressor nerd

great game
This supports my gambling problem and my poor purchases on the internet

amazing
everyone knows everything said about this game story good online bad but holy shit is online sometimes impossible sure grinding is inevitable but sometimes its genuinely hard to fathom how much you have to grind not to mention its been the buggiest piece of hardened dried shit on the side of your ass crack crashing  hackers servers getting fucked uncomfortable controls at best and an overall shitty experience especially playing alone makes online dogshit rockstar also really does not care about fixing the game because some fucking selfish shitheads just love to keep buying shit like shark cards letting rockstar chill with their actual billions pouring in every year all the while theyre removing good content because they know theyll just get more money anyways story fire though
love this game
dont believe the 69 hours on record most of the time ive played this game offline its probably closer to like 70 and i only played it for like a week insanely fun but genuinely an unhealthily addicting game
good
i like shooting people
shooting npcs fun

TAKES TOO MUCH DAMN TIME
Because the gta series are a great game in general
Good game especially considering its over 10 years old
Playing the campaign mode again on 2023  still doesnt dissapoint
Can the developers stop using this game for free money already and release GTA6
yas play again soon adfihlbauhfainn

"Pros Really fun game in story mode worth getting on sale havent played multiplayer and dont plan to
Cons For the love of god make better airplanehelicopter controls

Worthless game where players are allowed Vehicles that dont even follow Physics  Really now if people wanted to play Halo they should be playing Halo  The Oppressor MK2 should be renamed to the Noob Bike for what it is  Rockstar games have no idea what the hell they are doing with their game

buuuuuuuuuuuuus
This is the only game in the GTA Series that I have ever known But for the entire 1854 hours I have on record only like 10 of those are probably on story mode My recommendation is this game is worth it just to play online It is great amazing full of action and adventure that this game can really be for anyone well anyone at least 17 years and older but we all know there are kids who will get it anyway I will end with this This game has taken a huge chunk of my life or at least a few days worth of it anyway and I will say it were some of the calmest days I have ever had Probably helps its a game I was watching my babysitter play when I was like 11 or so so I have been interested in the game for a long long time

Im new this game and I enjoy it already nekoheart
This game is nice and all with good graphic but one problem is that its keeps on crashing and the online mode is so bad its so hard  to complete a missionheist as the online people keep on leaving or dying so i 100 dont recommend this game

Not capable of caring less about the single player story Absolutely love the online content with friends though Game can be a bit of a grind at times but once you get yourself up and running it gets pretty easy to keep money flowing without having to resort to shark card purchases Definitely dont regret picking it up

if you ignore all the bugs and the hardship called getting money and only concrentrate on the cardriving engine and everything that has to do with vehicles it is an amazing game
"Bought this game strictly for GTA Online because I had beat the story mode 23 times on XBOX One years ago
I played for a few hours went on youtube saw Cayo Perico Heist was best money
withing 2 days I had Kotsaka and did my first Cayo Perico Heist Grinded CPH for 2 weeks bought every buisness and vehicles i would ever want and quit It got super super super boring 4050 million for 100 hours of game play and to my liking ive beaten GTA Online
This is a pointless grind Wait for GTA 6 maybe"

Semplicemente un capolavoro senza tempo dopo più di 10 anni dalla sua uscita GTA 5 riesce ancora a tenere testa e a parer mio a superare anche molti giochi attuali con una storia semplicemente unica il gameplay risulta sempre pulitissimo anche se con dei minuscoli bug che comunque non vanno mai a inficiare significativamente nel gameplay e poi anche dopo 10 anni questo gioco ha un reparto grafico formidabile semplicemente un successo senza tempo

"Since I loose access to the email account linked to the stupid Rockstar launcher I cant use the game anymore What a gimmic This email Gmail is deleted since I stop using any Google shit So result I paid for a 108GB game for nothing  

PS Even if I try to create another Rockstar account I got the error message Your steam account is link with another email  so FUCK OFF"

Single PlayerCampaign game is great just want youd expect from a GTA game However GTA Online is terrible full of glitches stuck loading screens and hackersmodders that like to grief players
this game really puts you on an impossible grind and will most likely crash many times for many of you good game for messing around though you are going to wish you had money

Love the game its really fun i played this for 17 hours and i recmond playing this but the thing i dont like is that online theres no strip club which i need to check the atm because i need to take cash out so add that back to online
THERE ARE SOME HACKERS IN ONLINE BUT YOU CAN PLAY IN A PRIVATE SERVER SO ITS GOOD i just realised i typed that all in caps and im not gonna retype that
I BELEIVE THAT THIS GAME IS FOR 13 OR OLDER BUT IM NINE AND I LOVE THIS GAME SO

"GTA V  great game I still think GTA SA and GTA Vice City are still better because they have more iconic settings
GTA Online  IgnoreStay away GTA Online turned from fun idea to grindfestmoney sink
I cant give it a possitive review because it exploits its player base STOP WASTING MONEY ON MICRO TRANSACTIONS only buy full fledged expansions GTA V realy needs atleast one"

cna i see my wife yet
great idea and game for a time till they gave up on it and allowed hackers to ruin what was fun about the online aspects Instead of fixing it they would rather just shove a bunch of new stuff in your face to try and make you forget All new stuff never fixing none of the old bad stuff

jjjhhmmhhh  bbvfggfgggf
hei
Its ok
Imma be real I havent touched the story at all and I dont intend to Im purely playing this for the Online aspect and while the age of this game certainly shows itself from time to time Im enjoying the Online experience with my friends Weve done heists and tons of missions together and I feel like im getting better and better at it the more I go through plus the Nightclubs allow me to make some real money without making me feel like I have to open my own irl wallet just to fully enjoy the game Havent spent a dime and im having a blast
Its been 3 years without GTA 6 I cant stop shaking and Im having severe mental breakdowns I woke up today trying to buy GTA but the game is not here  I had a major panic attack but managed to calm down after a few hours I couldnt go to work today I am so worried that I even took my dads gun from the shed and started to speed boost I am nothing without GTA 6 it is my life it is my destiny without GTA 6 I wouldnt be able to do anything GTA 6 is the best thing i ever seen and I cant get rid of my addiction to it it is the best game in existence I cant stop trembling and crying I am very worried I used all of my money on gta games  I dont know what to do GTA 6 cant be gone any longer cause if it does then Ill go insane again breaking my mouse chair house and everything I own GTA 6 is very amazing and GTA 6 is my life

The graphics Theyre really good Then again I expect nothing less from Rockstar The games world Los Santos feels so alive Youve got these stunning sunsets that light up the skyline rain soaked streets that look real enough to touch and just a level of detail thats amazing Walking around the city or driving through the streets you cant help but appreciate the small stuff like how the light hits surfaces or the expressions on peoples faces Especially online mode GTA Vs online mode is the icing on top If youre into action packed gameplay youre in for a treat Both of these make the whole experience feel like youre right in the middle of this awesome virtual world Whether youre teaming up with friends or just out exploring GTA V nails it on both fronts and its a game you wont want to miss

this game is so fucking gay it gives you suicidle thoughts and might eventually brainwash u into doing very bad stuff like maybe killing urself or others and not necessary killing but harm aswell u will eventually get tired of the game and of life and will end up doign diabolical shit irl i highly do NOT reccomend to play this gay game for ur own sake use the money u could use on this game at something alse WARNING TO PARENTS please keep your kids away from this game even tho if they begg you to buy them the game do NOT buy it i am speaking from experience and i do not want anyone alse to experience what i receantly did

had a lobby without a modder once good game sometimes the game doesnt give you way to slow cars with way to strong enemies that do way to much damage and respawn infinitly for missions griefers most often have an iq of below zero flying into a building and then leaving after killing you THE BEST PART YOU HAVE TO PAY REAL MONEY TO PLAY THE GAME story mode good tho you can beat woman good game will orbital cannon children again 1010
amazing game waiting for gta 6
Its alright
aahe hhayw game

Also if they Have the Touching Feature in the Strip Club they Better add a Full on Sex feature into GTA 6 Or online

amazing definitely recommend
GTA V is an all in one game especially for simulation fans I love the open world and physics of this master piece
Very fun anyone who wants to download this game obviously knows about it so just get it worth the price
Far past its glory days but still GTA V is a fun game that has a decent story an almost unbeatably good open world experience and plenty of activities to do
very broken in ways but addictively fun with friends

A lot of hackers in the game The same few people pop up at random times in your games to leave spam discord messages then leave afterwards There is pretty much no limit to what the hackers can do to destroy your gaming experience The game is fun but its hard to enjoy it when the games economy is based on Bidenomics and hackers are constantly playing God

This game is a buggy mess I cant believe Steam and Rockstar are allowed to accept money for a game that is unplayable half the time This game is so old there should be no problems at all I own this game on PS4 and have never had so many loading problems as I have with this version This game should be removed from the store until it is fixed and loads correctly on a consistent basis Between the hackers and the stuck loading screens refunds should be given to everyone who paid money for this crap
great
its rlly fun i rlly like it
Its GTA and mostly play for online pretend gamble and pretend gangster sure

Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece that has captivated gamers around the world with its unparalleled blend of gripping storytelling breathtaking visuals and a dynamic openworld environment that offers endless possibilities As a dedicated player and enthusiast I can confidently say that GTA V stands as a shining testament to the incredible achievements of the gaming industry

From the moment you step foot into the sprawling metropolis of Los Santos youre immediately immersed in a living breathing world that feels incredibly alive The attention to detail is nothing short of astonishing from the bustling streets teeming with pedestrians to the meticulously designed interiors of various buildings Each nook and cranny of the city exudes authenticity and realism making it a joy to explore and experience

One of the standout features of GTA V is its engrossing storyline Rockstar Games has outdone themselves by weaving together the lives of three distinct protagonists  Michael Franklin and Trevor  in a narrative that is both compelling and emotionally charged The characters are multifaceted each bringing their own unique perspectives and motivations to the table Watching their stories unfold and intertwine is an experience that leaves a lasting impact making you genuinely care about their fates

Beyond the main storyline GTA V offers an astounding array of activities to keep players engaged for countless hours Whether youre indulging in highstakes heists that require meticulous planning partaking in adrenalinepumping races across land sea and air or simply enjoying the laidback pastimes like tennis golf and yoga theres something for every kind of player

The online component Grand Theft Auto Online elevates the game even further providing an expansive multiplayer playground that invites you to team up with friends or compete against others in a wide range of activities The continuous updates and content additions from Rockstar ensure that the experience remains fresh and exciting keeping players coming back for more

Visually GTA V is a masterpiece The level of detail in the graphics especially on modern hardware is simply breathtaking The world comes alive with stunningly realistic lighting weather effects and meticulously crafted environments The attention to detail extends to the character models vehicles and every facet of the games design contributing to an immersive and visually captivating experience

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a triumph in game design storytelling and openworld exploration Its unparalleled attention to detail engrossing narrative and wealth of content make it a mustplay title for gamers of all kinds Rockstar Games has delivered a true masterpiece that has set a new standard for openworld gaming and its an experience that no gamer should miss"

"h1Grand Theft Auto V  A Dizzying Descent into Gratuitous Violence and Societal Decayh1

Grand Theft Auto V GTA V stands as a prime example of a game that prioritizes shock value and gratuitous violence over meaningful storytelling and responsible gameplay While the series has garnered a massive following for its openworld environments and sandbox gameplay GTA V takes the worst aspects of its predecessors and amplifies them to an alarming degree creating a virtual playground that revels in immoral behavior and contributes to a troubling cultural landscape

From the outset GTA V showcases a narrative that glorifies criminality and glamorizes antisocial behavior The protagonists are a trio of morally bankrupt individuals each embroiled in a web of crime violence and corruption While the concept of playing as antiheroes is not inherently problematic GTA V crosses a line by portraying their actions as humorous and entertaining rather than exploring the consequences of their choices This lack of nuance and depth undermines any potential for meaningful character development reducing the story to a series of shockingly violent and exploitative set pieces

One of the most concerning aspects of GTA V is its unrelenting focus on violence and degradation The game offers players a staggering array of weapons to wreak havoc upon the game world from firearms and explosives to melee weapons This arsenal is used not just against rival gangs or law enforcement but also against innocent pedestrians and bystanders who are treated as little more than collateral damage The games missions often involve acts of brutality from torture sequences to heinous acts of cruelty further reinforcing the idea that violence is not only acceptable but also integral to progressing in the game

Furthermore GTA Vs openworld environment encourages players to engage in rampant destruction and chaos without any meaningful consequences The games mechanics actively reward players for causing mayhem such as earning money from committing crimes and evading the police This encourages a toxic cycle of behavior that normalizes criminality and recklessness undermining any semblance of ethical gameplay

The games treatment of women is particularly troubling perpetuating harmful stereotypes and objectification Female characters are often reduced to onedimensional roles existing solely for the purpose of providing sexual gratification or as mere plot devices The pervasive misogyny extends to the games humor which frequently relies on offensive and degrading jokes that reinforce harmful attitudes toward women

Beyond its narrative and thematic concerns GTA V also suffers from technical issues and a lack of innovation The games character models and animations appear outdated and stiff failing to match the level of graphical fidelity expected from a modern title The openworld environment while expansive often feels lifeless and devoid of meaningful interactions leading to a sense of emptiness and repetitiveness The online component Grand Theft Auto Online is plagued with microtransactions and a persistent grind that favors players willing to spend real money to progress further contributing to a sense of exploitation and unfairness

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V exemplifies a disturbing trend in the gaming industry where shock value and gratuitous violence take precedence over responsible storytelling and thoughtful gameplay The games glorification of criminal behavior exploitation of vulnerable themes and overall lack of accountability contribute to a toxic gaming culture that normalizes antisocial actions and undermines the potential for meaningful experiences Rather than pushing boundaries in a positive direction GTA V succumbs to the worst impulses of its creators resulting in a game that is more harmful than entertaining As a reflection of societal values and cultural impact GTA V stands as a stark reminder of the need for responsible and thoughtful game design that prioritizes the wellbeing of players and the broader gaming community"

"Grand Theft Auto V GTA 5 stands as an unparalleled masterpiece in the world of gaming delivering an immersive experience that has set new standards for openworld gameplay Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this installment showcasing their expertise in storytelling game mechanics and worldbuilding As a devoted player I can confidently award GTA 5 a welldeserved 5star rating

The first aspect that strikes players is the meticulously crafted world of Los Santos and Blaine County The level of detail is astonishing with every nook and cranny teeming with life from bustling city streets to serene countryside landscapes The sheer scope of the map coupled with the seamless transition between urban and rural environments creates a living breathing world that feels genuine and alive

The games narrative is another standout feature The interwoven stories of three distinct protagonists  Michael Franklin and Trevor  bring a refreshing dynamic to the traditional GTA formula Each character has their own unique background motivations and quirks adding layers of complexity to the storyline Rockstars signature satire and social commentary are wellpresented making the narrative both engaging and thoughtprovoking

Gameplay mechanics in GTA 5 are nothing short of exceptional The driving mechanics strike a perfect balance between realism and fun ensuring that vehicular mayhem remains as entertaining as ever Shooting mechanics are smooth and responsive enhancing the actionpacked sequences that the series is renowned for The addition of heists adds an extra layer of strategy and excitement enabling players to meticulously plan and execute highstakes robberies with their chosen crew

What truly sets GTA 5 apart is the online multiplayer mode Grand Theft Auto Online Its a sprawling universe in its own right offering players the chance to explore Los Santos with their friends engage in various activities and even create their own content The consistent updates and additions by Rockstar have kept the online community vibrant and everevolving

Graphically GTA 5 continues to amaze even years after its initial release The attention to detail realistic lighting and meticulous character animations create an immersive experience that stands the test of time The level of optimization on various platforms is commendable ensuring that players across different systems can enjoy the game without compromising on visual quality

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a magnum opus in the gaming world Its combination of a richly detailed open world engaging characters gripping narrative and diverse gameplay mechanics make it a landmark achievement Whether youre a fan of action storytelling exploration or simply causing virtual chaos GTA 5 offers an unforgettable experience Without a doubt it deserves a perfect 5star rating for its lasting impact on the gaming industry"

bruh it gta
When I was growing up I couldnt really play these kinds of video games in my mothers household I never bothered to play this game at a friends house either I just never got around to it That was until I turned 20 years old and moved out of my parents house and into my own apartment I found this game on sale and I figured why not get it After 80 hours into this game barely touched the multiplayer mind you Im in love with the single player campaign Im glad I never played this game until I turned 20 because not only am I free from having to look over my shoulder when Im at the strip club but I understand jokes and references 14 year old me wouldve never understood The campaign is hilarious and really fun to play and I know im 10 years behind on all of this but I waited long enough to finally play this game that my parents banned with extreme predjudice
If games counted for real world war crimes id have a triple life sentence
its fun but would be better with gta 6

"Oh Grand Theft Auto V you wild sussy and absolutely ridiculous masterpiece Buckle up babes cause were about to dive into the zaniest world this side of Ohio Lemme tell ya when I first loaded up this game I was like nahhhhh they didnt just go there But they did and I forgor all my worries cause I was bout to come on this epic adventure gang gang

The moment I stepped into Los Santos I felt like an amogus in a world full of swaggy chaos I mean seriously where else can you casually jack a car chase a train and rob a convenience store in one go Its like a reallife favorite meme compilation except youre in control of the madness Yummers

But lets talk about them characters fam Michael Trevor and Franklin  what a trio Michaels like that older femboy in the hood tryna keep it lowkey but ending up in the wildest heists Trevor Oh my days that man is pure chaotic energy Every time hes on screen its an ermm yoinks moment and you just cant help but love the crazy mofo

And speaking of NPCs oh boy theyre a whole mood Youll find em bing chilling on the streets saying some of the most random stuff Its like theyre all part of a secret Ohio club or something Youll be walking along and some dude just hits you with a scrumptious line outta nowhere Only in GTA V I tell ya

The city itself Los Santos is a work of art so vibrant and full of life From the posh neighborhoods to the gritty back alleys its a melting pot of weird and wonderful You can even switch between characters which is like being in multiple places at once being your own femboy army  zesty times indeed

But lets be real sometimes the games humor can be a bit NPC level like theyre trying too hard to be funny And those loading screens ugh theyre longer than a crosscountry road trip from Ohio to California But hey nothings perfect right

In the end Grand Theft Auto V is a sussy rollercoaster of chaos and adventure a game that leaves you laughing scratching your head and yelling when the impostor is sus all in one sitting Its a classic thats imprinted its mark on gaming culture and you cant deny its impact So if you havent played it yet what are you waiting for Hop in fam and lets go on a wild goofy ahh ride through the crazy streets of Los Santos"

"GTA Online was the best and worst thing to happen to rockstar
Made them lazy and complacent since they can just print money cause of the mindless kids who enjoy wasting money on that sort of thing 
But not all is Negative and most of my salt comes from the fact we will probably never see a DLC to the story of any rockstar game cause theres no way for them to monetize it 
The story in this is phenomenal such an incredible performance from all the voice actors and talent 
One of the prettier games ever made as well
I wish there was a mixed review button cause most of my hate and infuriation with the game really comes from lovebut i have never been a fan of how GTA Online works at all and that will probably never changeunlike rockstar lmao"
"In comparison to its predecessor GTA IV it has significant downgrades in its physics engine and driving mechanics The story mode doesnt get anywhere near as dark but it introduces many new fun mechanics If youre strictly interested in the single player experience I would honestly recommend GTA IV first That being said for people more interested in multiplayer GTA Vs online experience suffers from many issues steer away from public lobbies The game has fallen off and all of their content released after 2017 has only contributed to its downfall

The only reason I can recommend this game is because despite its shortcomings and terrible updates it still has a lot to offer and is typically on sale for 15 or less Just buy it its been nearly 10 years"

Ive invested 6 hours into this game only to find that the game has progression issues attempting one of the story line quests only ends in a glitch and then have quit the game and tried multiple time to try to advance and get the glitch each time Ive requested a refund and im probably going to get told its over the 2 hour limit this bs steam says is a policy well steam you a holes what happens if the problem doesnt happen until later in the game   fix your policy
this game sucks shit harder than a black hole
great game
nice
ass
good
greatest game ever made
pog
r
It only works once in a while but I still cant play online mode
Pretty great game I liked the story and its ending Ten years on and the graphics still look good
They have ruined the game 2 years after release gta ONLINE atleast They made it pay to play and to grind is IMPOSSIBLE To put it into perspective most decent cars are 1m or more a normal mission takes about 15 minutes to complete and you get 15k TOPS  The average guy cannot play this game and enjoy it you would have to make it your life over 40 hrs a week  Also they ban people for no reason and if there is a good reason they will not share it with you or talk to you about it so hope you dont sell 2 many cars or get a griefer modder to drop u cash or something without your intent  cuz your account will be gone  Happened to me 2 times after years of playing  Single player is the best but the bad side is they havnt done ANYTHING to it since the release so u got a day of enjoyment there and its over
best game ever
play it a lot but the fun is always very limited all the setup mission take away from the fun of the heists also the world feels big but empty

Dont waste your time All it takes is someone to hack your  and rockstar does nothing to help you recover it Absolute theft waste of time and money at this point
Its a great game i love the pvp in online but im having an issue with loading in i can load up GTA but it uses Rockstar games to load up and it just locks itself and i cant play Other than that 100 recomend GTA V
just yes
This game is really fun I think youll enjoy it aswell well I hope you do

Better controls than console
"Grand Theft Auto V is a sandbox game that takes place in the streets in the fictional crime city of Los Santos based upon los angeles Within the game you can complete missions heists own businesses and one of my favorites commit mass genocide upon innocent civilians All jokes aside GTA is one of my favorite games just because of the wide variety of content that it offers You can really do almost anything crimerelated that you see in movies ranging from escaping the cops in a highspeed police pursuit to robbing the richest man on earth

      The game has two entirely separate parts Theres the story mode and the online mode For a person who enjoys a compelling adventure story mode has one of the best experiences gaming has to offer with you being able to play the role as a criminal millionaire father of two millennial kids Michael a physco named Trevor or a nice but rough gangster who goes by Franklin 

     The online version on the other hand puts you in a server with around 30 other people offering a different experience entirely While you can still do things like rob stores do heists and run businesses the goal of the online version is to simply aquire as much money as possible and grief other players with the most overpowered vehicles and weapons the game has to offer This version requires A LOT more time and dedication than the story mode to really do anything and the grinding that is needed to earn any substantial amount of money is gruesome and tedius If you dont have irl money to just buy your way up the ranks or enough time for the insane amount of grinding I would just focus on the story mode 

Overall Both aspects of the game are cool but Id say the story mode is where the real fun is at The game doesnt cost much money and tbh it gives you a pretty good bang for your buck so I personally would recommend getting it Anywho that was my opinion hope yall have a good one peace"
grinding stinky no money everything expense and no money but grind impossible dum doodoo buttere
This game is amazing I only played the campaign but got 40 hours worth of it This game is definitely a masterpiece

"Currently sitting at 22 hours played and I can assure you that 20 hours was just me driving a taxi and hitting everything I could not on purpose

rockstar got so fat off of the gta online money that they completely stopped caring about all of their games all they want is you to spend money so it makes your grind easier very fun to play with friends and drive around but even that has gotten stale after a decade of playing gta online

now i can not play anymore

"My name is Walter Hartwell White I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane Albuquerque New Mexico 87104 This is my confession If youre watching this tape Im probably dead murdered by my brotherinlaw Hank Schrader Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist Shortly after my 50th birthday Hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world Connections that he made through his career with the DEA I was astounded I I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was thrown confused but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family Hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make And I was weak I didnt want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed Every day I think back at that moment with regret I quickly realized that I was in way over my head and Hank had a partner a man named Gustavo Fring a businessman Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when I tried to quit Fring threatened my family I didnt know where to turn Eventually Hank and Fring had a falling out From what I can gather Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which Fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated Fring was able to arrange uh I guess I guess you call it a hit on my brotherinlaw and failed but Hank was seriously injured and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over 177000 Upon recovery Hank was bent on revenge working with a man named Hector Salamanca he plotted to kill Fring and did so In fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it I have often contemplated suicide but Im a coward I wanted to go to the police but I was frightened Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me For 3 months he kept them My wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what I had done why Hank had taken our children We were scared I was in Hell I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family Recently I tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this I cant take this anymore I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me or worse hurt my family I All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is

"This could have been The best GTA or even game of the decade thanks to the Online mode

Sadly something happened to Rockstar Games it seems and they went from one of the most inspiring studio in the game industry to something similar to ubisoft or activision

Online has been full of hackers and bugs for about 8 years now and nothing changed since almost day one 
Between bugs and hackers if stars align you can spend 4h not playing the game despite playing it"

"FINALLY

Ive completed this title a second time now since I completed it in the Xbox 360

Theres not much to say really Everybody knows GTA V Its a classic now I would say Great story great mechanics and great soundtrack A campaign that Ive replayed a thousand times already because of how good it is

On the other hand I really like GTA Online but I feel Rockstar has not been the same since all the attention went down only to this section I wouldve wanted a more balanced way of dealing with the other games in the company like releasing a good remaster of the GTA trilogy to add content to RDO or to simply make new games like they used to Im sad about the way the company is right now and one can only hope they were what they used to be years ago"

"Alright lets get one thing straight  the story in GTA V Yeah its like it was given to a 16 years old pimp to write it its a hot mess that even a Brain death wouldnt write But hold up before you go running for the hills this game still shines brighter than a supernova

I mean come on were talking about a game made by Rockstar Its like Rockstar read the book of mayhem tore it up and rewrote it with a rocket launcher in hand And hey lets not forget that the online chaos is like a neverending party in the underworld

Sure the story might be a dumpster fire but lets not kid ourselves  this game is like an old buddy from way back when Nostalgia hits you harder than a freight train and you cant help but remember the good times youve had with this bad boy Ive practically lived breathed and thrown controllers at the screen because of this game Its the kind of nostalgia trip that makes you wanna hug your console and thank it for all the hours of pure insanity

So lets cut the crap and give credit where its due GTA V might have a story thats more messed up than a pimp on caffeine but damn its the kind of mess we cant help but love Its like that crazy ex you cant forget  infuriating and irresistible at the same damn time So grab your weapons rev up those engines and dive headfirst into the chaos because this game is a wild ride you wont want to miss"

"Had a lot of fun playing Grand Theft Auto 5 the missions were interesting funny and fairly easy Grand Theft Auto Online is also fun to play even tho all those tryhards and modders are a pain in the ass For me personally I dont really like to play it alone I cant find anything I could do except for doing cargo Which gets boring after some time or play missions with randoms you either get lucky or unlucky with them

But all in all its a great game love to play it"
Best Game Ever Created
So I bought the Great White Shark GTA1500000  1999 and it has not showed up in game Is there something I need to do first before receiving it in game

Nie jest to grywalne na PC ale jak nie mam konsoli to nie mam wyboru xD
I Do not recommend this game to any one Rockstar has the worse Customer service i have ever seen  After taking a year off from playing i signed back in to find the email that was attached to the account to be wrong so i was unable to sign in i contacted customer support and have been dealing with them for over 2 months and they keep going in circles and not helping  At this point i have uninstalled all the their games from my computer
You can bump into pedestrians and push them over You dont even get wanted if you dont kill anyone 1010

dont buy it from steam its not able to launch via rockstar game and you will not get any support from them as well
"GTAV story mode has dozens of hours worth of content to offer and i have to point out that i dont personally know anyone who attained a 100 completion yet Thats just about where the fun ends GTA Online is completely broken and instead of fixing known issues Rockstar games keeps adding new content that breaks the game even more

all the new content that Rockstar Games adds is boring theres nothing interesting all the latest missions basically force you to use heavy weapons like minigun RPG etc which gets boring very quickly Its straight up impossible to finish them with a simple assault rifle whether its caused by a dozen enemies spawning at your own spawn point or the fact that the NPCs have an absurd accuracy and can give you a headshot even when they dont see you through the bushes

Old content has few missions that keep repeating over and over and become repetitive very quickly  at this point I am doing them just for the money and even then i often dont want to launch them

Public online sessions are unplayable you have about an 80 chance of joining a lobby with a cheater who will teleport you all across the map against your will lock you in a cage explode you or even give you modded money which can easily result in you getting banned and having your entire progress reset Rockstar games has supposedly done some changes recently but I have not noticed any difference same goes for my friends

I couldnt forget to mention how Rockstar games has recently removed almost 200 old vehicles with no rational explanation They are now incredibly difficult or impossible to obtain even though many of them were very popular in the playerbase The reasoning Rockstar games has given us is that they wanted to remove vehicles that werent being purchased very often to reduce how much we would have to scroll on the websites

GTA Online also used to have many different competitive jobs especially adversary modes I remember browsing through a list of hundreds of different adversary modes the game had to offer Recently I have come to the horrible discovery that Rockstar games has yet again deleted the old content and that the list now contains barely 60 adversary modes and exactly none of the ones i used to play I havent found any announcement about this anywhere only people complaining about it and being equally as confused as me

TLDR this game is absolutely not worth buying in 2023 and onward and thats coming from someone whos been playing since 2016 If you do want to get it do yourself a favor and wait for a sale"
The community in this game sucks Not only are the developers mentally limited no the players are too In addition it is very likely that they play the game with a blindfold and their feet instead of hands There is no other way to explain how you can be so incredibly dog shit at a game this easy
great game with FiveM been loving it

I LOVE THIS GAME OMH
one of the best game in the world
game is overall shit but online is fun
Honestly at this point i would not recommend GTA V it has been 10 Years and it just has a lot of issues Leveling up in the LS Car meet takes an insane amount of time their is no fast way to do it unless you wanna leave you PC on idle for hours to unlock car meet exclusive liveries The Dre contract while it can earn you a good amount of money the 40 minute cool down or so really kinda kills it This game has really become more of a cool down simulator where you always have a timer before you can make big money Which is of course intentional because shark cards exist and they want you to buy those Grinding is very tedious in this game so many vehicles and customizations are locked behind other items you have to purchase which could be really annoying The heists are a good way to make money but if you have no one to play with it can be difficult to do alone and at times just are not worth it Now GTA V can be fun to play online with friends and the story is not terrible by any means But all the stupid tactics they use to make everything as annoying as possible in hopes that you will buy their shark cards is well unbearable at times I have put many hours into this most of it is from idle leveling in the ls car meet Not really worth it though You also can not have more than one vehicle out at a time which is frustrating It should allow you to have at  least your car and jet out at the same time You also can not fast travel to your ownowned properties The cut scenes for missions and heists are not skippable because of how they were developed also you can not turn off dialogue alone because it is mixed with the SFX and listening to Lester and Franklin Dre etc gets really old really fast

The Rockstar games launcher is a virtual fucking hemmorrhoid and R also apparently removed a large amount of content in a recent update just so they can dripfeed it back in as new content Single player was abandoned nearly a decade ago in favour of the literal billions in microtransactions that Online brings Rs parent company which is honestly a shame because I would have loved to see more expansions similar to what GTA IV had

The game boasts stunning graphics and attention to detail that bring the city to life from bustling urban streets to serene countryside landscapes The variety of characters each with their own stories adds depth to the narrative making for a compelling singleplayer experience

GTA 5s gameplay is a seamless blend of story missions heists and a myriad of side activities Whether driving highspeed vehicles participating in thrilling shootouts or just enjoying leisurely pastimes like tennis or golf theres never a dull moment The diverse range of vehicles weapons and customization options ensures that players can tailor their experience to suit their preferences

One highlight of GTA 5 is the innovative GTA Online mode offering a dynamic multiplayer environment Friends can team up to tackle missions races and challenges or engage in more chaotic activities like openworld mayhem and heists The constant updates and new content injected into the online world keep the experience fresh and exciting

While GTA 5s storyline and gameplay are undeniably engaging its important to note that the games mature themes including violence crime and adult content may not be suitable for all audiences Despite this GTA 5 remains a standout title in the gaming world offering a blend of action exploration and storytelling that continues to captivate players"

Just not into it anymore

Rockstar doesnt give a shit about the cheaters that make the majority of its playerbase 
They dont care about the former because of the latter 
Rockstar wont even let you contact them to make a formal complaint 
They dont want to hear it 
So get this review instead 
Mechanically the game is great Graphics are great Servers connectivety is a bit spotty but playable 
Its the cheaters that are the majority of the players ruin this game online Totally unplayable 
I cannot thumb down this game hard enough for this critical factor"

hi guys
very good
good game
Sure you can rob a bank drive a tank but why on earth cant I kill Frank Whole game stank
"fun game id recommend playing with friends if you have them

the game has some activities to do but it pretty limited late game

after playing for a while and youve gotten most of everything the game just feels repetitive and bland but it takes quite some time to get to that point most of the game is just grinding for cash so youll probably be repeating the same jobs or missions over and over 

also the anti cheat on this game is pretty much nonexistent so expect cheaters andor easily accessible cheats"
good
Worthwhile
i like this game

The game is a masterpiece but I quit playing because of the hackers and modders they just ruin the expirience end rockstar dont give a FUCk about it
Just be sure you log into the correct Social Club Account on first time login Its a pain getting your steam account disconnected from it
Just give us GTA VI already

Too many griefers to enjoy the online game Real sadists on here Waste of nearly 500 hours of my life Everything else about the game is good like the basic mechanics and the campaign but everyone online is just the worst possible person and the devs seem to enable them with every update Also hackers are everywhere and they can ruin your gameday much more easily without any consequence Do NOT buy this game
fine
i stole some mans car and i saw a picture of his dead wife and kids thank you rockstar games
loves it purrrrrrrrrr
I got hooked on GTA Onljne the moment I started playing it No other game has caught my interest since
How do I buy a new gun

One day Social Club just stopped working on my PC and Steam Deck Reinstall didnt help and there is no way to go to previous version  With R stance on modding they can go to hell

I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone who wants to play online The modders make the game unplayable Even the ones who give you money are limited to not very much and then you get disconnected anyways Its chaos with people from around the world and makes the came pointless

awsm to play
this stupid Dev support hacker Fuck you
I literally cant even launch the game because I have to login to a Rockstar Social Club account It says I already have a account linked to my steam even though I have never played it on steam on a pc only xbox360 Its trying to make me login into a account with a email address I dont even recognize I cant even submit a disconnect request because I have none of the account info needed to unlink it Id love to actually play GTA again but looks like I just have to play it on 360
Yes
steady
its fun
its super fun but not alot of updates and a bunch of hackers
"Base game works fine but multiplayer gives me the most grief It used to work but now it dont Cannot download Online Files I suppose that doesnt matter since I no longer have online friends to justify an experience filled with trolls hackers and tryhards

General Complaints
Characters run slow like molasses compared to protagonist of GTA SA Turning is sluggish sacrificing satisfying locomotion in favor of smooth transition between animations or realism

Dying is easier and armor wears off quicker

alfredo is not good at this game i am better stronger and more smart than him

story mode is only fun when using mods after you finish game tbh
woo
quite took a long time to connect into the online server Still bring me good exp even that from the 10 years old game
hi
its fun and you can get a good laugh out of your own game play
Yes Yes
I like getting lap dances
it fun and my 10 year old laptop can run it at 30 to 60 fps on an hd graphics 520
Online mode is so good and interesting in gta 5  we can buy some really cool garage and store super cars and also special vehicles I would recommend you to play this game on atleast a 4gb graphics card device with i5 for smooth performance Based on my experience online mode is better than story mode  especially if you have friends who play Gta online I personally love using military outfits and supercars  tanks and other miltary and futuristic vehicles in online mode I think this game will help you gain experience which will later help you when GTA 6 is released  This game shouldnt be played in presence of parents because of some inappropriate scenes and language
pls add workshop for gta 5 offline i rly want to play gta offline mod but i dont want get banned

"I used to love this game now however it is unplayable online In every session you will find hackers who have modded their game in some way which disrupts the whole server and can cause grief to any player playing on it
Other hackers dont even bother modding their game but instead can tell you your own IP address  best to use a VPN if you do play online

Mostly though its the mod hackers who pull out laser guns and can edit any other players location appearance or environment that you got to watch out for
Youll also find that Rockstar are very tolerant of these kinds of players unfortunately"
one of the best games i have ever played would play again but rockstar is getting greedy and money hungry also  lalalalalalallllalalalalalaalalallalaalalal

AWESOME GAME
Hello and welcome what is hopefully my final attempt at completing GTA 5 without taking any damage I have a max HP of 1 so any damage from any source will immediately kill me I also want this to be a nohit run so Trevors special ability is disabled Because while it prevents you from taking damage it does not prevent you from being hit by things I have successfully completed every single mission without taking any damage I should have yet to do it all in one go My current personal best for an entire run is one bit of damage and therefore one death Obviously very close to a perfect run so Im hoping this time Ill get an actual perfect run and avoid all damage entirely
This Grand Theft Auto online V is one of my favorite game The game has amazing graphics missions possibilities and reality open world game I loved it Thanks Rockstars
its real
you can shoot american gangstars
it is a game you can doso much on and not only that u can learn from the game and it feels like your really in the place that los antos is based of its a game you have to have the time a patients for but yet its a game money well spent

"Otherwise a good game fun with friends until you decide to go heisting
You start the heist retry the heist for an hour then are about to finish it one of these things always happen
1 Someone gets randomly yeeted from the game and the heist fails
2 You retry the heist you sit in loading screen for 10mins for the heist to fail
3 Someone gets yeeted to singleplayer after completing heist and is left wondering if they got the reward
4 Option 3 but doesnt get a reward and gets to go thru fun time with Rockstar support for getting the reward
And oh yea the cheaters
Cheaters wont get banned but if you might be in the same lobby as the said cheater you may get banned"

WHAT A CLASSIC
I use to give it a positive review but clearly Rockstar has abandoned this game to hackers
"Rockstar account got stolen No response fro Rockstar Support

Rockstar account was stolen First i got locked out of my acc they are able to unlink my Rockstar acc from my steam then change the email on my Rockstar acc

Sent a ticket to Rockstar  No response after almost 4 days now"
too often experiencing servers error Rockstar is fast if to fix the money glitch but for hand off for the error like this they only prioritize their own pocket
Good Game Rewcomended too
drugs gangs and death is what makes life beautiful 
its ok ig

"they removed 180 fucking cars from gta online thats really setting a precedent about how you will own nothing and be happy its because we needed to streamline the purchasing of newer vehicles
THEN DECLUTTER AND ADD FILTERSSEARCH TO YOUR FUCKING INGAME SITES DONT MAKE THIS OUR PROBLEM THE GAME ISNT ANY SMALLER AS A RESULT ITS YOU BEING TOO FUCKING LAZY TO PROGRAM A GOD DAMN UI FOR BETTER FUNCTIONALITY 
Lets be real here the game is old they probably dont know how the fucking code even works for the ingame sites anymore and they fired all the programmers who actually knew what was going on in our benefit but R said BUT THAT COSTS MONNEEEEEYYYY NOOOOOOO

Boycotting gta6 suck my dick R You banned my friend rightfully so the first time but then i tried to boost their second account and you ban them but the hackers THE HACKERS NOOOO SIR CANT REALLY TAKE CARE OF THEM Your money should be spent on FIXING THE HACKER PROBLEM AND THEN RELEASING MORE CONTENT PEOPLE WILL PLAY WHEN THEY ARENT BOOTED FROM LOBBIES OR DEALING WITH GODMODE GODCOMPLEX FUCK HEADS THEYYYY ARE THE REASON THINGS ARE DEVALUED IN THE GAME NOT CAYO

As a  great man once said a heartfelt fuck you to R and every employee not getting themselves fired speaking up about this shit go along to get along because you get your fucking paycheck never mind RUINING the experience or brand paying your fucking check fuck everything about the world rn"

Go ahead and report them all you want because in a new feature Rockstar rolled out with this game they simply wont give a shit Rockstar will never never under any circumstances ban a griefer who is openly modding in an online lobby but if you should ever find an exploit that allows you to make money quickly without your obligatory tithe to the almighty Shark Card you can expect your account to be reset andor banned within the hour 
Money exploits are patched instantly High payout missions will be immediately nerfed Any possible chance of having fun in this game will be immediately identified by Rockstars elite teams and removed before you can actually get the idea that maybe this is a fun game But the guy whos spawning yachts in the middle of the city and setting you on fire over and over again in combat free zones will never never be banned Thats a Rockstar guarantee"

1 Option to purchase additional safehouses Story Mode
2 Option to change default character vehicle Story Mode

Other than that  a definite musthave for any gamer"
Only play fiveM actual game is trash
Well it is a good game but people use mods in public server but it is not commen
"This game is unplayable on PC the online lobbies have a 50 chance of having modders running rampant Seriously if you want this game for public lobbies then get it on console instead

Aside from public lobbies on PC GTA Online is a fun game but its milked dry and a monetisation nightmare If you want anything new and cool you better pay up or sacrifice all of your free time to grind for it"

i have almost 60 hours in the game and someone hacked my Rockstar account so now I cant log in because of the ROCKSTAR Launcher whoever designed it so the games you purchase on steam cant be accessed if you dont have a rockstar account should never be able to work in game development ever again Fuck Rockstar

Fine until you want to have fun in this game Why are you able to buy customisable 007 Bond car but not a fighter jet Ridiculous
hehe
Franklin Trevor and Michael are good trio
This is an amazing game Ive been playing GTA games since GTA III GTA 3 and this is just behind GTASA in terms of the single player campaign entertainment but going up to the online makes this game the best of all franchise so far
I am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
hehe cacca culo spisnelo
Modders ruin it
Крутая игра
idk
steal
the cops hate me
"I cannot believe this game is turning 10 years old

Even if you dislike open world games even if you prefer another GTA title over this one and despite the pit that is GTA Online and the downright disgusting and disrespectful treatment towards fans and modders from TakeTwo Interactive there is no denying just how special Grand Theft Auto V is

This absolute beast of a game in single player still feels like the most rich beautiful and entertaining open world game ever made even after having finished it on all 7th and 8th gen consoles and PC

From excitedly coming home from school on September 17th 2013 to a freshly collected preorder for the Xbox 360 to reluctantly buying this game a fifth time on Steam in 2023 every playthrough feels like a fresh experience Whether it be the order in which I tackle main and side missions a new detail I never noticed previously a random event I dont recall or never discovered switching up my approach to a heist a radio song making action in the moment more impactful or just finding a new way to make my own fun out in free roam GTA V is a timeless masterpiece and I think Ill be revisiting even another decade down the line even if GTA VI tops it

Bravo Rockstar Games Thank you"

"I really love the game This is how I still remember it back in 2017 when I had a PC that could run this on 60Fps
I really wish that you could download Online  Story Mode Separately so that the low end gamers or low storage doesnt have to delete anything I remember this was 37gb or something but worth it"
"Story is good

Online is OK Everythings expensive but if youre into business development covert heist operations and drug empire type stuff the grind can be fun
In public lobbies expect toxic players and some destructive most of the time modders The upcoming release of GTA 6 is likely going to slow things down development wise
Expect minor bugs nothing game breaking"

good game installed over 20 mods
bought this game for my friends who wanted to play with me got no friends no more lol so ig 7 carrots out of 12 chimichangas
This is the best game
Just know that if you buy this game on steam that your Rockstar Social Account has to be linked to your Steam account and if your RS account gets hacked then you will not be able to ever play any of the RS games you have bought on Steam and there is no Fixing this RS will not help you out to fix this problem
I have played like 2325 of the story mode and its VERY FUN and addicting The characters are super cool and the realistic cityurban type setting is so fascinating I havent played much online because its a little bit boring but I think it will be much more fun once I finish story mode DEFINITELY would recommend
This game proves that there is no hope for humanity And im all for it

"Im gonna quote Todd Howard It just doesnt work 

Playing this piece of dogsht for a long time you realize how many easy things theyve missed the mark on Quality of life updates are absolutely absent they make this game so unneedingly tidious And if youre playing this solo then dont I dunno whats more depressing playing online solo or playing LoL Singleplayer is enjoyable and satisfying but the online experience is straight whack Dont get me even started on the community where in every major lobby theres somehow someone with cheats and a modmenu Every Single Time Updates are getting alot staler with no heists or bigger activities added KD is now only affected by 1v1 duels Ingame inflation is worse than in real life how the Fck They just remove vehicles and content and then drip feed said content to GTA subscribers Expect the grind to get worse yearonyear with smaller and smaller updates The loading is slow starting jobsactivities is slow cant kick any nuisance since there isnt a feature for kicking yet Man eff dis shiii They had to kill Red Dead Online to have GTA Online comatosed"

"Grand Theft Auto V is an openworld action game with a variety of different gamemodes The game features a singleplayer story and an online world which has received many updates and improvements over the years Although GTA online has been receiving countless updates R still hasnt managed to do anything about a cheater problem There are many other problems in GTA online besides cheaters including griefers long loading times and forced coop work Many features to ease out solo player have however been added to the game but still at least a one friend is required to unlock and enjoy all the activities the game contains

bStoryb There are three protagonists iMichael Franklin and Trevori and the story follows their criminal life Cant say if I enjoyed the story or not since I have yet to finish it

bMissions and Heists ionlineib There are a lot of missions in GTA online some of which can be completed solo while others require 2 or even 4 people Heists have a couple of setup missions and the whole heist usually takes around an hour to complete Single missions however take somewhere between 520 minutes each There are nowadays sort of miniheists introduced in tuners update which have 2 setups and take around 2040 minutes to complete

bUnbalanced enemies ionlineib The missions and heists have very different enemies especially if we compare and old mission to a new one A lot of the enemies are quite easy icops for examplei to defeat but then there are few missions where the enemies just straight up murder you from a mile away Doomsday heists are a pretty good example of a very difficult enemies However a civilian with a car is the most dangerous enemy in the entire game It is just simply impossible to know what they are going to do They might for example randomly run you down or head on collide with you on a motorway

bUnbalanced payouts ionlineib As mentioned previously there a many mission and heists Most of the missions have a horrible payout for amount of time they take to complete Some of the heists are a perfect example of this Lets take two heists for example which both take around one hour to complete other pays 500000 and the other pays 1500000 I wonder which one I should play hmm oh I forgot to mention that the first heist requires 4 players while they second can be completed solo There are also shark cards that can be bought to gain some extra money But the payouts of those iincluding the slight increase a while agoi are even more horrible than some of the missions For example the biggest shark card costs 75 and that will give you 10000000 in game which doesnt sound too bad However when you take a look of what you can actually buy with it is like 3 cars and maybe a shirt You can just as easily save your 75 and make the 10000000 in game in like 58 hours while having some fun with the process

bProperties and Vehicles ionlineib There are a lot of vehicles in GTA online some of which you are still able to buy anytime due to recent changes Most of the vehicles however cannot be bought anymore from the websites but have to either be bought from a dealership or win as a prize when they appear idealership deals and prizes change once a weeki There are also a lot of properties in the game most of which you have to own to play some of the missions and heists Pricing of the properties is somewhat balanced but pricing of the vehicles is not There are for example a lot of over 2000000 cars which are absolutely garbage to drive I seriously recommend new players to watch some guides before buying anything ivehicles mostlyi

bCheaters and Griefers ionlineib GTA online has a lot of cheaters and griefers Some of the cheaters however are harmless but most are not and they will try to ruin everyones experience playing the game I wouldnt recommend anyone to play in a public lobby for this reason Dont lose faith in the game just because the community is what it is

h1Would I recommend this gameh1
 Yes iwouldnt really play over 2000 hours otherwisei
 Definitely worth it if on sale the game has many problems but still a great game underneath

This is one of the best games ive ever played highly recommended
"Just to be clear Im leaving this review for GTA Online I havent given the story a try so if youre looking to purchase for the single player disregard this review

GTAO is not worth playing anymore at any price The content is great and there arent any games that really scratch the same itch including RDRO but the game is so unstable that I cant recommend anyone try it if they dont already own it Half of your time is spent actually getting into a lobby between long load times and straight up crashesfreezes Once your in you might also find that content just doesnt work or is difficult to actually access multiple times Ill load into a lobby to find that I cant launch my Securoserve or Motorcycle Club for example And even then when everything is working every single lobby is filled with hackersmodders This is not hyperbole I legitimately have not played a lobby without someone spamming booming noises trying to get me to buy GTA or spawning NPCs to murder me or any other number of griefing hacks

You can eventually get the game to function and when it does its fantastic Like I said before GTAOs content is fantastic and incredibly unique but to get to the gameplay you have to wade through an ocean of dogshit If youre considering picking up this game just to play Online look elsewhere GTAO is no longer worth your time"

"Coming up on 10000 hours in this game I can safely say it has taught me programming

I used GTAV as a stepping stone over 5 years to teach me a lot of programming concepts and explore various technologies by building multiplayer experiences through alternative multiplayer frameworks such as altV and FiveM

This game has had a profound effect on my life through thirdparty multiplayer mods and it took me at hour 9000 to actually play the single player of this game I never even bothered with the story because I was so enthralled by writing small game modes using alternative clients

As a programmer or someone who wants to become a programmer Take a look at some the alternative mods because they can teach you a lot Ive since moved on to game development

This game jump started my professional career as a software engineer"

"I first bought GTA 5 on the ps3 I then got it for PS4 and also have it on ps5

GTA is a great game and always has been I think we all know that by now I have 0 complaints about the steam copy of the game works fine 

I got it simply to try out fiveM servers which are not all they are cracked up to be so if buying for that reason and already own it elsewhereno need to get it here 

Otherwise if you do not already own it alreadyyou should"

While the story is great everything about the gameplay is terrible  Its like every AAA title coming out these days where the passion of a small team is replaced by 1000 people working a job for a paycheck  Its contributing to the death of modern gaming and something needs to be done quickly to change it
Do not get this game It fucking remove 180 fucking cars and called it DLC Rockstar is run by a bunch of retarted monkeys zoo animals not racial profiling
i love mod menus just to get money
Well its GTA what more can I say
makes me wanna commit crimes
Ive never been a fan of GTA As a kid I played a few titles like GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas but they never really held my interest for long I quickly lost interest to put it shortly However this year although now I regret not doing it earlier I decided to give GTA V a chance and I dont regret it at all I always used to say that GTA games are senseless just mindless chaos car thefts and being a ruthless serial killer  I mean I still partly think that but this time I set aside my prejudices and fell in love with GTA V The story characters Los Santos side activities attention to detail dialogues all of it just keeps me hooked Every hour spent in GTA V brings me a lot of laughter and gives me so much fun I havent tried Online yet for now Im having a blast in Story Mode Ive heard that Online mode is for masochists and people with nerves of steel who have to deal with hackersmodders in their everyday gaming Maybe someday Ill join that Online community and see how strong my mental state is Anyway I recommend this masterpiece to everyone
Story mode means n word 400 times Epic shooting and mass murder The prostitutes they aint sluts but they are hoes shoot the prostitutes to get the money you spent back Fun game 1010 would eat this game
the sixth one was better
awesome game but milking it to much

how cool it is
Great way to get your IP leaked by playing Online 1010
While it is a great game its completely ruined by the fact that rockstar has seemingly given up on the battle against hackers and the game is in a complete state of dismay The only way to enjoy this game is solo or a private lobby as the hackers have managed to hit new extremes that I have never seen in any other game ever Hackers were able to start screen recording on my pc and play audio loops I couldnt stop and it honestly makes me question if this game is even safe to play as it maybe allowing hackers access to my pc Id understand a bit more if gta 6 was out but this is still the most relevant title in the series and they are just letting them destroy it
uytt
this game is great and i recommend you play it
awesome play cant wait to get my controllers

"This is a legendary game More precisely the last part of the legendary Grand Theft Auto series of games or briefly GTA
Although the fifth part of GTA was released to the world a long time ago it still does not look outdated This game is still fun and enjoyable to play And if you dont play then just arrange a pogrom on the streets or in the open spaces of a large open world
Even now the elaboration of the surrounding world is impressive Even the seabed is detailed
The game has an interesting storyline of three characters that is just fun to play Its also fun to explore the world
If you are a fan of this series of games you definitely need to play this game Its better than reading too many words

I definitely recommend this game to everyone"
Its one of the best games
the customer support is quiet disappointing but the game is fine sometimes gta v online sucks
very racist

one of the best online games f all time and story is pretty damn great compared to the new video games totally worth it

Account was hacked now I cannot play it and both support teams are a waste I wasted my money on this game to only be not allowed a refund or be able to even play the game I do not recommend using anything Rockstar related because it is almost like they cant keep thousands of people from losing their ability to play Rockstar games

Pros
Great Graphics
Funny Storyline moments
Characters which represent human defects
An abundance of mission to choose from
Great online experience

Cons
Is not as realistic as GTA IV was even tho V is 5 years newer
A lot of cars got removed in the last online update

In conclusion I recommend this game to everyone You should buy it and play it because GTA VI isnt coming soon"

The Oppressor MK2 turned GTA V into a champagne socialist simulator
pew pew pedestrian simulator
Lspdfr is crazy
there is too much modding and hackers online they should look into banning all account related to moders and hackers
Why have I spent this much time in this godforsaken game I havent even played the story Its all from doing absolutely pointless garbage with my friends It wasnt even that fun HELP
game work good lot of hacker tho
"Very fun to play with mods and mod menus 
just make sure the mod menu you are abt to use isnt detected so you dont get banned online"
glitchy as shit
Requires Rockstar social club to launch even the single player Great game sail the seas

absolutaly amazing game

WHERE TF IS GTA 6  THIS GAME IS OLDER THAN MY LITTLE BROTHER
Ive already beaten gta v on my ps5 and i bought it on pc so i could mod gta and beat it again with a different ending absolutely amazing story line
amazing
i recommend people play this so they can be real life criminals like me
good game
"Very solid game Played this on console for a couple of years before deciding to get it on pc it was on sale The only issue that I can complain about is that
YOU DONT MAKE REMOTELY ENOUGH MONEY TO GET ANYTHING IN THE GAME THIS MAKES IT SO YOU HAVE TO GRIND FOR HOURS TO EVEN GET A DECENT PLACE TO LIVE 
In conclusion it appears that Rockstar wants you to buy their money using irl money This game may be one of the biggest online scam games in gaming history

Cant fucking load anything without crashing or sitting idle for 15 minutes like cmon cock star this game is 10 years old it still takes 5 minutes to load into online and every loading zone is a 15 minute blank screen because the idiots that programmed this game did a half assed job and the game does nothing literally theres a video explaining what gta is trying to do during those extremely long loading screens and the guy fixed it in like 5 minutes but cock star is too full of well to fix their game not to mention its still peer to peer online so everyone can see everyone elses IP address because rockstar is too cheap to have dedicated servers for their biggest game This game is a mess without a mod menu mostly for protection from all the losers with a god complex on a 10 year old game crashing you kicking you greifing you with endless explosions from anywhere in the map spawning on you to kill you etc Now thanks to rockstars infinite laziness pc doesnt get any good updates everything is for the 15th generation of console this game has been on and people talk crap about skyrim and all because cock star refuses to do anything about their security and is hiding behind the consoles security to fix their shit game

You Can Do Anything Like Having A Shootout With The Cops Or Steal
This game is the best sandbox crime game if you play singleplayer and use mods absolute must have for that reason alone Dont bother with online and stick to the singleplayer so you can really have a lot of fun my hours speak for themselves and I also played on Xbox One and PS3
fly bike go boom steal 
its a great game but i advise people to play story mode before online only because it gets you ready for gun fire driving and its just a great story

"One of the most entertaining and detailed masterpieces thats a decade old and still updated to this date Very impressive and admirable Great storyline voice acting and motion capture Graphics are above average for the time it was created though around average or a tiny bit below average in modern day standards Just wish NPC drivers reacted to car horns by speaking moving their cars to the side or pointing a gun at us and shooting though Maybe thatll happen in GTA 6 Make it happen Rockstar

Fun game but only buy it on sale and never make a microtransaction Anybody at Rockstar that put any effort into actually making the game has been paid and is working on something else Whatever skeleton crew they have left supporting the game is a joke No need to give them more money just to sit on their asses and tell you they cant fix anything in the game

"The online version of the game is full of cheaters and Rockstar do absolutely nothing about it Makes for a moderately unenjoyable experience for the most part 
On the days there are no cheaters online it can be a bit of fun"
single player has a decent campaign not the best rockstar has done but not the worse the theme is still in par with the Grand theft auto series as a whole probably one of the better gta games the GTA online is riddled with bugs and problems that rockstar just flat out doesnt fix the game has tons of hackers and modders that break the game and deletes or removes your ability to enjoy the game and there is an endless cash grab trying to get players to ignore the core reason for gtaonline and just buy your self in game money to bypass your lack of skills to gain the money neccessary that aside the adition of private mission playable areas are a blessing on a broken system though modders can still ruin your day by blowing you up and harrasing you it is a mass action not a targeted harassment you just log out and not play for a few days and they may have gotten bored and left

"Played GTA online for about 3 or 4 hours Some hacker put some device on my character like a jetpack and my character would fly outofcontrol and die nonstop even after reviving Online  1010 for the hackers

Although the singleplayer story mode is kinda cool 

But Rockstar have a multiplayer mode that only works for hackers

Will you play story mode Go for it buy the game

Will you buy to play multiplayer Dont buy it

Edit A friend told me how to create private sessions in the online mode For this reason I recommend the game now"

Arguably the most revolutionary game to ever be released Very fun game both online and story mode 100 recommend Also very affordable
"Do you like Grand Theft Auto V Ive been a big Rockstar Games fan ever since the release of their 2001 masterpiece Grand Theft Auto III Before that I really didnt understand any of their work It was too quirky for my taste But when GTA III came out in 01 I think they really came into their own commercially and artistically

The whole game has a clear crisp graphics and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the gameplay a big boost Its been compared to Saints Row but I think GTA has a far more bitter cynical sense of humor

In 2013 Rockstar Games released this Grand Theft Auto V their most accomplished game yet I think their undisputed masterpiece is Three Leaf Clover a mission where your character robs a bank The mission is extremely intense and by the time it ends it has an emotional resonance thats very hard to shake Its a perfect encapsulation of the narrative strength of the game something Rockstar has perfected Its about breaking the law but on a deeper level its a devastating critique of the capitalist machinery that drives our society

The games graphics especially in the Los Santos city are so bright and incredibly detailed that they really highlight the games underlying message of the falseness of the American Dream This isnt just a great actionadventure game its a great sociopolitical statement

But I also think Grand Theft Auto V works because of its threedimensional characters Michael a retired bank robber is a vivid portrayal of a man struggling with the emptiness of success Franklin a young hustler showcases the struggles of someone trying to escape the harsh realities of urban life And Trevor the games most anarchic figure provides a chilling glimpse into the psyche of a true sociopath Its this trifecta of perspectives that makes the game a standout in the gaming industry

The online multiplayer mode is fun a great way to blow off steam and also quite addicting It adds to the replayability of the game making it more than worth its price

You can tell that Rockstar Games was really firing on all cylinders here because the games breadth and depth are almost staggering Every mission feels meticulously crafted every character brims with life every satirical jab hits its mark In terms of sheer scope and ambition theres really nothing else quite like it

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto Vs immersive narrative topnotch gameplay mechanics and cutting satirical humor make it not just a standout title in the Grand Theft Auto series but also a high watermark in the history of video gaming Its only in the context of this complete artistic statement that the brilliance of the game truly shines through"

"This game is very fun to play with friends or alone there are so many things to do But money is hard to get you always need to do preps for heists and that takes like 1 to 2 hours  you do it with friends cause alone its almost impossible and then you get like 25 percent of the money and thats like 600 thousand

But like this if you are also banned cause you used cheat engine "

"Yes I would recommend GTA V to other players It is a highly popular openworld actionadventure game developed by Rockstar North The game offers a vast and detailed openworld environment set in a fictional version of Los Angeles and its surroundings
Players can experience an engaging storyline with three main protagonists each with their own unique personality and background The narrative combines action drama and humor providing an immersive gaming experience"
good game
cool game taught me how to drive inrl and now i teach my kids on gta than on the road 1010
Constant crashing online disconnects and hackers ruining it Console version is better
seruuuu
Certainly between the toppest games to have Though theres a good handful of abusive modders online and the game isnt as maintained as it used to it is still a banger
Even 8 years later this game is easily one of the best that you can buy
i hate tryhard players

cranking 90s in these innocent civilians is almost as fun as dropping a MOAB and drone striking innocent civilians in iraq on god"

"Honestly unless you are willing to put an extra 20 MINIMUM into a decent mod menu this game is not worth it The state of PC GTA in 2023 is pretty rough with roughly half of every lobby having cheats in some capacity not hyperbole genuinely at least 50 of every public lobby you get into

If you are really deadset on riding the 2013 nostalgia train I do encourage you to look up Stand Free Stand Menu offers the Protections portion of their mod menu to everyone completely for free This at the very least will stop most Griefing Kicking or Crashing methods and it will make your GTAO experience in 2023 at least tolerable"
"kill random grieffer
he is a moder
try his best to destroy my game
makes me crash
1010
story mod good too 
 gta online is not an online gta 5 experience its more like some WW3 game "
Hadnt played in awhile and due to my own failed research I couldnt not transfer from my PS4 account to PC making my purchase useless and unfortunately dont feel like grinding my life away again trying to make up for it
Strip club boobies is good
its cool second place to San Andreas and definitely one of the best experiences you can get from a video game
Very nice
great grameeee
it was amazing and my childhood
It is fun
good because car funny

dude it was i was playing this game and it was time to unleash the kraken as they say you know what i mean i think you do so basically i go and do so and then i come back and i keep playing and then i feel a great rumble in my abdomen and i think it was time to birth the megalodon as they say you know what i mean i think you do so i go and unleash my guts and i come back and keep playing and i saw this guy on the street and i walk up to him and punch him you know so i punch him and he gets mad and hits me back and im not just gonna take that right no im gonna fight back and that hoe dead after one punch straight to the face lmao he was out for sure lights out as they say you know what i mean hes going to the hospital you know these ambulance guys pull up and they start investigating his body and then this guy looks at me funny so you know i ask him you got a problem or something and he gets a little mad right so i throw a punch knock him out straight away his buddy goes oh my god and tries to stop me from beating on his dead corpse but i am NOT letting that happen so i headbutt him straight in his nefarious noggin and hes out cold so basically theres this stream of ambulances coming infinitely to the site of these fights and i keep beating up rounds of EMTs like some waves of zombies you know what i mean so i get bored a little and drive around and i end up at the top of mount chiliad right so i find this couple going for a hike to the top of the mountain right and im not liking the looks of this guy so i kick him off the mountain and his wife starts crying like a little baby you know so i beat her ass and she goes rolling down the mountain lol and then everyone else at the top of the mountain starts to run away so i whip out my pistol and shoot all those guys you know what i mean like no witnesses as they say you know so after that i go for a little sky dive myself right i get to the bottom of the mountain by this river and theres a runway nearby so i go over there to see whats going down and theres a few planes with no one nearby so you know what i do i hop into the biggest plane i see and fly that bitch off into the sunset and you know im having a blast just flying this thing around and then i accidentally fly into military airspace right and you know they dont like that for some reason so they send their little men after me and crash headfirst right into their stupid little jet right so then both our planes are done for you know like on fire no right wing you know so i hop out and so i already used my parachute so you know im just falling to my death screaming really loud you know just reminiscing about all the fun i had in the previous 30 minutes and so i start to tear up a bit you know just cause its so fun and then next thing i know im laying on the floor in a puddle of blood and im wasted bullshit ass game

its a good game with a amazing story mode but gta online is a grind and since rockstar kinda has their head up their hole they cant come out with good updates overpricing everything for crying out loud a beat up van with some guns on it is 1 million like WHAT but if you like the satisfaction of completing heists or buying that one car or garage you wanted then gta online is just for you also be patient because rockstar made waiting times inhumane

Its a good game havent played online yet though
"Steal car Kill police and anyone else in the way 
Online is great for creating and showing off cars for example Ive been making all the cars from the fast and the furious franchise 
Offline mode consists of a great story line as Rokstar are known for
Hacking is the only issue in online mode almost all the public lobbies have hackers I just make friend only sessions
Price is decent for what you get however the game can be grindy at times in online mode the best thing to do is forget about the money and have fun and before you know it youve got millions
Highly recommend"

100 should get it i got addicted very fast
i like ramming my car into civilians 1010 very realistic
real life if it was good
GTA Online is a wild hellscape that encourages griefing and domestic terrorism i am sick of the npc cars trying to swerve into you for no reason and the unrealistic time limits for selling goods from your personal businesses that require you to have a mate get on to help you other wise you lose half your sell value I am just so fucking sick of practically being asked to hand my wallet over every time i log into the game
the best game ever
played for 331 hours all i did is grind never buy this game
Guns go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr cops go splat
good game
its okay
hi

I alleady have exactly 199879 hours in this game on console I love everything about this game the story the caracters the open wrold just everything im sad to see that rockstar dosent give a shit about online safety tho
cgj8ytpt7odicgtupiyfxjug yes

"step 1 ask your mom to come look at something 
step 2 show her the cool shoe store"
Great game Very competitive players The vehicle community on the game is also great Other than there being hackers still roaming extensively on the game still to this day it is not a bad experience
good
They really are just milking a corpse that somehow still manages to get money from people this game really went downhill ever since they added the Opressor MK 2 and scifi broken stuff
Very good game I love GTA serial Best GTA games
"Absolute cancer online Modders and cheaters everywhere Full of 1213 year old kids who ruin your experience

Edit Even today every single session is modders cheating exploding and causing havoc online Rockstar doing absolutely nothing about it Such a shame the game has potential to be amazing but its riddled with cancerous little modders"
GOOD

Yall I recommend to buy this game when its on sale especially with the bundles that contain a shark card depends on how much  u have The storyline is very good every mission is madeprogrammed with detail you can experience some bugs but like this game is a decade old but everythings fine The city is very beautiful almost a perfect replica of Los Angeles aswell is North Yankton but u cannot visit it its just a part of 2 missions Overall I like this game very much and you can def buy it again on sale its much better
COOL GAME
good GAME
yes 1010
I literally still dont know how to drive

After hours in this game i can assure you that it is only worth your time if you are a cheater or want to play the singe player story mode Ignoring the constant game breaking bugs and rampant server issues this game can be fun However there are cheaters and modders everywhere who constantly harass you and prevent you from playing the game while you cant do anything about it except leave the game Cheats include invincibility teleportation killing every player in their vicinity or every player in the lobby kicking everyone from the lobby transporting everyone in the lobby to a location or specific players to locations changing it so that it looks like they didnt kill everyone etc This doesnt mention how cheaters can openly talk about cheating in chat or how bots will destroy your eardrums by announcing cheats and money for sale to the entire lobby This especially matters in a game based upon money where cheating can ruin hours of hard work and patience Until rockstar cares about the player this game will remain unplayable

"Im gonna be honest here GTA V is an amazing game that I skipped out on for years and after playing it I can guarantee that the singleplayer story was fun and messing around offline was also fun the games pretty good in that regard  However I bought the game in the hopes of playing the Online mode with friends and ran into a brick wall

Rockstar requires you to use its Social Club to log into Online mode and while I hate the use of a separate launcher and service when I already have Steam I just ignored it and kept going  That wouldnt be a problem if I could actually log into Online mode because whenever I tried itd display Social Club is offline  Sorry Rockstar Game Services are unavailable  This wasnt during any downtime in the servers I know of mind you this was over the course of several days and as far as I see it is an issue that hits a good few people

I tried every suggestion I could find to fix the issue  restarting my computer a clean reinstall of the Rockstar Launcher a clean reinstall of GTA V fiddling with my firewall settings tinkering with the DNS settings and even what Rockstar suggests and nothing worked  I could log into the launcher and play singleplayer but I couldnt even log in ingame  As far as I can see the game is just fucked  sure I can replay the story but I bought this to play with friends not to play alone

In short buy this at your discretion  its a fun game but if you run into the same issue I have good luck getting past it  I know some of these fixes work for a few people but in most cases Id wager thosere flukes"

HAHA CGE NALNG
This game is very interesting  You get a open world where you can do anything whatever you want and may more I will definitely recommend this game for you 
The only reason i bought this was to play it with mods as Ive already bought and played this game 3 times at least However the modding scene is in one of the worst state Ive ever seen in a community Modding the game is tedious and most of the mods are paywalled using patreon Its funny these entitled modders think they deserve compensation for manipulating another companies assets using software developed by said company to hold their hand through the process Its literally the easiest job in gaming developement and you dont deserve a penny Also charging money for mods is breaking TOS and Illegal I will be reporting your mods and patreons to Rockstar so good luck

sometime while playing gta 5 game showing screen issue how we can resolve this issue
mhm
Do not play the online and then its good
very fun to play with friends
Honestly a good game but the Social Club and online are so useless when Steam exists Why do I need another online service for a game thats amazing offline but just turns into random nonsense that begs for more money to ruin everything Certainly worth full price even as GTA6 is coming up but theres no reason to spend more money just to play with the bloat that is GTA Online At least it has an online while Red Dead is only good until you beat the game once Point is Ive had more frustrations than I ever needed because of things that are not the single player
online is so fun i love getting raped by an 8 year old on their brothers computer flying a jet bike that somehow has missiles 1010
ALLWAY STUCK IN LOODING SCREEN

To finally roam and invite
Newcomers to play with us
For many years weve been all alone
Were forced to be still and play
The same songs weve known since that day
An imposter took our life away
Now were stuck here to decay
Please let us get in
Dont lock us away
Were not like what youre thinking
Were poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And were forced here to take that role
Weve been all alone
Stuck in our little zone
Since 1987
Join us be our friend
Or just be stuck and defend
After all you only got
Five nights at Freddys

Why do you want to stay
Five nights at Freddys

I just dont get it
Why do you want to stay
Five nights at Freddys oh
Were really quite surprised
We get to see you another night
You should have looked for another job
You should have said to this place goodbye
Its like theres so much more
Maybe youve been in this place before
We remember a face like yours
You seem acquainted with those doors
Please let us get in
Dont lock us away
Were not like what youre thinking
Were poor little souls
Who have lost all control
And were forced here to take that role
Weve been all alone
Stuck in our little zone

"GTAV through Steam is actualy my second purchase of GTA 5 
I lost my first complete GTA 5 install due to malicious modders
I lost more than two hundred dollars worth of shark card purchases many many millions in gta money  real estate autos and planes
Over ten years worth of gaming hours and accumulated assets an RP were lost when a modder stole my online identity and Rockstar has failed to recover it for me
If you buy GTA for the PC you can expect relentless harassment by modders who can do to you what they did to me and Rockstar can not do a thing to stop them
If you do buy the game you can also google and check out the Kiddions mod menu It is a free menu system that allows you to spawn most of the vehicles in the game for use in the current session 
It is a fun game to play on those rare occasions when there are no modders and no one trying to sell you menus to further ruin your enjoyment Just dont invest more your hard earned money on the game than you want to potentialy lose in an instant"
bang kalo main roll play kaya mana dah
I own this game on 4 accounts and Ive replayed the story multiple times the story is clenching and sucks you into the game and each character Not only is the story good but the online version is even better with a never scene before experience
This game old asf when 6 coming out plus online is ass
Car is fast Flying Bike is Faster
"GTA never fails to please

One of my favourite games of all time Ive played this game on all Xbox PC and Xbox 360 as well 

GTA Online is 10x funner with friends so if you have a friend who enjoys playing shooters such as Payday 2 Call of Duty etc Then theyre bound to love this one

Even with or without friends it is still fun

I think my only complaint would be the fact that most of my friends who do play GTA play on Xbox so because I have a GTA 5 Xbox account I hate having to always switch between accounts And I wish Rockstar implemented the feature of account linking but hopefully they do that when GTA 6 releases 

But until then
enjoy having a blast with GTA 5"
GOAT game

"I  am  getting hacked on the middle of mission and cant carry on Forced to shut down game This is sucks
278 hours update
In order to get rid off hackers abusers you must play in Invite only mode
Game is much more pleasant but still freezing and stopping right on the middle of delivery and you loosing money being collected all day
Also game makes you repeat lots of stupid stuff like Resources  and it completely takes fun out Developers are taking shortcuts by running you around map for nothing"

Grand Theft Auto V GTA V a decade after its initial release continues to stand as one of the best video games ever made The game offers an unmatched singleplayer experience with a captivating storyline and an expansive openworld environment that impresses players even today GTA Online the multiplayer mode has evolved with time providing numerous engaging activities for players to enjoy While some may have grown tired of the game over the years its objective greatness remains undeniable From an outstanding map design to a perfect sandbox setting GTA V offers endless hours of entertainment Regardless of when it first released it would still amaze players and be hailed as an exceptional gaming masterpiece

This game is really fun i downloaded it so i could play lspdfr and five m is is realistic and the best game i have ever downloaded
I Love the game but when i logged in it did not have my pass and when i made a new account is said use your old account

you forget a thousand things everyday make sure this review isnt one of them
decided to play in 2023 although as of writing this i have 5 hours its amazing
did you pray today
Whenever you play this game online there are atleast 2 modders in every server and they ruin the game for everyone Doesnt matter you report them they are never getting banned 95 of the modders are chinese and they cant even speak english the slightest They just attack people put them in cages teleport them to random places explode them out of nowhere literally killing every player in the server at the same time splashing you with water and chainstunning you until you die etc When you try to report them your game crashes They can even kick your from the servers like an admin Do you know what rockstar did They released a special DLC for the new console players like people who own a PS5 Rockstar doesnt care about PC players literally These modders have been in the game for 5 years straight PC players have been complaining about the modders for years and they release a special DLC for PS5 and XBOX Series XS They are almost saying f you to PC players Im just done Never buying a rockstar game ever again Please dont tell me to go invite only server its pointless to play online when i play solo in a server Its not my responsibility to get these servers cleaned from cheaters Rockstar is the greediest game company ever existed To the people who wants to get the game  just dont Its a waste of time You are like the aim training of players who use godmode and they just ruin your game all day If you want to play single players its so null and basic Not worth it
This game is painful to play Everyone is cheating and its always in a game breaking way Cant recommend buying anymore

"Bought specifically to play GTA online just to check it out after 10 odd years not touching it Needless to say it hasnt changed much The Online experience is plagued with cheaters currency selling spam bots that destroy your eardrums and content solely tailored towards group play Im getting old already and my friends dont have time to sit down with me for a 5 hour GTA session But honestly Im just not interested in tailoring my time around others So Ive been playing private lobbies Fine whatever but this leads me to the content offered to my level 15 only because some hacker was in my first game and was apparently giving everyone xp and cash every little while After the tutorial mission with Lamar youre literally thrown into overwhelming positions and or missions you have no means to deal with

Mission to go steal van that has drugs in it Sure np Nick the van and get chased and gunned down by 4 chasing vehicles because only have a pistol Death mission failed but hey got points and money Real fun

Next I accept some of the criminal empire pack that came bundled with the game Fing clueless So I pick CEO of the bank instead of leader of Bike gang Take my first mission after spending about 10  of my networth on bank and warehouse One crate of narcotics sweet Just go and pick it up there might be some resistance but Ive spent some money at a gun van earlier and bought a decent rifle Head towards the drop Mayweather has intervened and taken off IN A HELICOPTER The f Chased helicopter around for 20 minutes shooting at it with my rifle cause wtf else was I supposed to do Of course it does nothing and fail because of timer Half an hour wasted doing nothing but losing money

Im sure its a good game played in a group But as a new solo player just jumping in to explore content for the first time it was by far one of the worst online experiences I have ever encountered The most fun I had was in the dressing room trying to make  my female avatar more pleasant to look at The rest was stress frustration and ultimately disappointment

Not totally sure what I was expecting Something along the lines of the single player with the option to run with other players Of course Ill be or at least trying to be checking out more content but HS after 10 years This really shows the incompetence or neglect of Rockstar

Edit The single player is as good as it was on release but thats it Any and all content released for this game since has been for GTA online So if you want a true solo experience youre gated to very limited content The push to live service is obvious they can milk people for money but always multiplayer all the time spoils the experience Be it trolls spam cheatershacks Its just unappealing Theres a reason why genuine MMOs and singleplayer online games like Genshin and Honkai cater to solo players"

"Bee Movie
By Jerry Seinfeld

NARRATOR
Black screen with text The sound of buzzing bees can be heard
According to all known laws
of aviation
 
there is no way a bee
should be able to fly
 
Its wings are too small to get
its fat little body off the ground
 
The bee of course flies anyway
 
because bees dont care
what humans think is impossible

Game was amazing years ago but too many hackers now
Cant join an online game get an error
Worth it
r
LOVE IT
yeah
good
""
gg but there are many hacker i often face them in online but it is a fun game
Very Good Game
uh yeah cool game it was probably worth the money but it took like 5 hours to download but it runs at 60 fps idk how that makes sense but yeah its good
can actually run more than 30 fps
Just wait for the promotions then but the premium edetion good luck
the 2nd open world game i played after super Mario oddesy
While the General Concept of Grand Theft Auto is good There are too many hackers at this point you have a 60 chanceOr More that any public session you go into will contain 1 hacker MINIMUM Other than that I seem to disconnect from hosts sessions a lot Mainly Diamond Heists before even being able to actually join them causing a wasted 13 minutes in loading time every single time I go to try and join that the heist you also have a lot of people who both kick you fail to change their sessions to Private to avoid people constantly joining leading to you being kicked since they only want their friend in there OR you have hosts that start the mission then either leave right after or its a joined player that leaves after its already been started leading to a huge frustration when trying to ever join in on HeistsMissions You also have people that try and trick you and pull you into helping them with Setups for heists but then most wont even invite you to the actual heist leading you to not really want to help people with more of their setups

"Warning must have constant internet for use If your internet is spotty well that sucks for us I guess

I paid for a copy of this game on every single platform Starting with my PSP to my 360and ps3 And the program I own must phone home for use every damn time When Im out camping I should be able to use my Ayaneo to play in a month in 10 months of no internet 

I have owned many consoles these are the first to always require internet"
great game fun for the whole family

Game wont even load for me on steam lmao
This game is probably my favorite game to play right now my only problems are that the anti cheat sucks modding is so easy to spot in every lobby and that the game isnt crossplay

this is my favorite game
"If this was 2013 and Obama was still president Id give GTA V a 1010 But its not 2013 anymore And Rockstar Games refuses to leave this relic behind for newer titles due to pure greed 

GTA Online is a bloated shameless scam of a game that becomes more and more ridiculous with its greed with with every update Now theyre removing hundreds of previously purchasable cars to put them behind a subscription service If this was EA or Activision Angry Joe and The Act Man would be leading a gamer mob to their headquarters But Rockstar always gets a pass And this has had dire consequences for gaming

The fact that GTA V has been milked as long as it has and red dead online the supposed greatest game ever according to Kotaku journalists had its online mode abandoned so early has sent a clear message to Rockstar and take two that they can do whatever they want and nobody will stop them No amount of despicable anti consumer practices will ever be punished because omg guys GTA VI might come out one day 

I hate the legacy GTA V and GTA Online have left for gaming It sent a clear message to scumbag AAA developers that this kind of nonsense would be tolerated Just look at Overwatch 2 or anthem or cyberpunk or sea of thieves or no mans sky or battlefront 2 This is all a result of a post GTA online landscape 

GTA V I curse the day you ever came out"

THIS GAME IS SO SH1T I HOPE ROCKSTAR COMMIT S8ICIDE
I love killing random people
yeah the game is great everyone loves it but despite it being like 9 years old I think it would be cool if rockstar actually cared about online finding a session without a cheater or modder is nearly impossible Its in my opinion ridiciulus that you have to play with ur internet just to get session without people

W Game L Company

It is cool
Nice game
Dont buy it because its always prompted me to be online even thought its offline no matter how many times you launch the launcher it always prompted to be online on ps4 version once installed no matter how many times you launch it stays offline just get the pirated version instead

"I loved playing this game when it first came out great game Infact I came back to visit just to find out that my rockstar social account got hacked After contacting Rockstar support they returned the account no problem I got everything fixed and was able to play the game once more for about two weeks and guess what happens 
I get email from rockstar asking to confirm my account all in Chinese and cannot play it 
How you guys just gonna let these guys keep taking our games like this Its a serious issue for anyone looking to get the future titles like GTA 6"
very good game
нет
best game ever
we just want gta 6 now this game is starting to get irrelevant and mods fivem and storymode are the only things holding this game online is just full of moders now its to a point its not worth playing unless you can get a friend who mods to help through heists
great game to play and im excited for gta 6
VERY GOOD
good
best game
its sooo realistic and i want GTA 6
its cool
cool
"Its just plain fun Theres a whole lot of freedom and story within the game to explore There is so much detail put into this game when considering its age 

I do with Rockstar would do a bit better of a job with hackers and glitchers in the online mode because there are some ridiculously gamebreaking things going on sometimes"
Hookers Drugs Guns all of the 3 so V good
No just no This game wants me to make an account before I can play it just like so many other games these days No f u c k o f f Ive had it Im fed up I just want to play the game not make an account for every single piece of software I bought a license for
PC lobbies often have hackers I cant lie but a enjoyable game nonetheless especially if you grab it on sale years worth of content here to sink your teeth into when it comes to the online gameplay
best realist game out there

"GTA 5 is a good game but Rockstars security is so horrendous that even only playing offline singleplayer is enough to get your account hijacked from hackers

Someone being able to change YOUR email AND YOUR password for YOUR account from THEIR account without any confirmation from YOU in YOUR account is completely unacceptable and is enough for me to give a negative rating"

Hello possible GTA 5 consumers this game is good well the single player is its action packed awesome story good gun play and better driving then in GTA 4 and the characters special ability mechanic is very cool and GTA online is insanely mediocre and is filled with hackers who can even see your IP if ur gonna play gta online prepare to be BORED and use a vpn stay safe
Good game its very corny and i love it
i like it becuz it funnnn
E
Gta online has been milked dry the matchmaking sucks and you are lucky to even find a lobby without a modder Fun with friends but thats it
perfect
"Ah yes Grand Theft Auto The game series i grew up with Actually ive learmed English thru this game When i was just 4 years old i was already playing GTA IV with like 7 i started playing GTA V on my brothers PS3 then PS4 abd now PC and PS5 God knows how many years later im still here playing this game 

Story 1010 Full with Action and really good storytelling

Graphics PS3 810 for its time it was advanced PS4 710 It has good graphics but PS5 and PC 1010 becouse even tho this used to be a PS3 game and is over 10 years old the graphics are amazing on these two platforms

Gameplay 1010 it just feels amazing without doubt the best gameplay i had ever seen untill RDR2 came out

DLCs 510 used to be amazing but got let down by Rockstar Games and now the new DLCs are just boring 2 DLCs every year one in summer and one in winter

Overall 810 Its just an amazing game i grew up with and even learned a whole language from If you are thinking about buying it to play the story do it its worth it Online is fun but buying the game alone for the story is enough I bought some VR glasses and later found out that you can play this game with a mod in VR I played the whole story in VR it was just amazing

Thank you Rockstar Games for this title you made my childhood

and Leon even tho we planned to make Operation Militarybase when we was in 3 grade ad you cant park the Jet you stole in your garage even tho we thought we chould we have to do it one day WHEN YOU FINALLY GET YOUR PC 

Blxfroxt"
Even though Rockstar games have become EAs grandchild this game is in contention for the GOAT Title IMHO
guyASDfcuxtys
Great game
fun W friends
impatiently waiting on GTA VI even tho I havent even finished GTA V story mode 
"Shitton of stuff is thrown right at you and you have no idea where to start what to do what is there available from the very beginning how to start some random DLC RGB LBGT update that came out 4 years ago 34 of content requires other people to play 
Your phone is constantly spammed with random bullshit of new stuff unlocked available blah blah blah
UI is horrible making even Ubisoft design team look good in comparison 

In my 5 hours of playing this Ive managed to rob a few stores complete 1 race steal an RV and deliver it to some place also got a free house and an armored car 

Whats my objective How to progress the game Nah dude you dont need that so basically here is some random popup that sends you to a mission with 6000 award 

Jesus Christ what a mess"
"TLDR The game WAS great Online isnt worth trying to get into if you havent already But if you just want a fun singleplayer story campgain the game is still acceptable 

At its core this game is timeless Its fantastic for wasting time whether you enjoy roaming around in singleplayer with a mod menu or playing the campaign or screwing around in gta online with friends but the recent monetization updates have really been trying to kill the online aspect of gta If you are a new player and you are unwilling to purchase money through shark cards or other micro transactions its really not worth trying to get into And even if you are willing to spend the extra money be prepared to deal with infinite black screen loading bugs brought on by modders in the lobby and other griefing from hackers and modders And even if you get lucky enough to not be in a lobby with them good luck avoiding idiots riding flying bikes and shooting you with missiles just because you exist in the lobby"

I am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game my son invited me and he took us into a casino heist I was a bit confused about the games mechanics and so I asked my Son for help my son hosted a game for me to join so he could teach me how to drive a car and how to purchase weapons we had an absolute blast I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

"The friends were imperfect in one way or another so they helped each other to fill what they were lacking and embarked on a journey to make their wishes come true The Scarecrow wanted a brain the  Tin Woodsman wanted a heart the Cowardly Lion wanted courage and Dorothy  wanted to return home

The one they thought to be the great wizard instead gave the Woodsman a lead heart

But youre a machine that means you were built to serve humans Dont you understand Machines dont need a heart Good job making it all the way here though take this as compensation Be sure to tell  everyone waiting for you that your wish definitely came true

Some left with satisfaction The friends departed and were never to be seen again The hard cold lead was depressing 

The Tin Woodsman couldnt agree with this In anger he swung his axe through the wizards heart The warm heart was pulsing vigorously He shoved the lead into the wizards now empty chest For the first time in his life the Woodsman started laughing at the sight and felt a pleasure hed never had before

Grabbing a chunk of mushy hearts he shoves it into his chest There will never be enough hearts Once a Woodsman he now cuts down people instead of trees This is a forest full of hearts No matter how many he cuts down the forest still remains dense A kind person would carry a warmer heart

When the heart is lost the Woodsman will fall to his knees in sorrow clutching his empty chest As if begging for the only thing he has left not to be taken"

The Great Game of This Current Era
the story mode doesnt have a lot of vehicles to choose from compared to online mode They have more vehicles to buy like yachts and jet fighters but its annoying to play online because you sometimes get killed by other players a dozen times And it doesnt help when you have to travel to mission activities to earn money instead of selecting those missions from a menu And every time you die you always lose ammo that you didnt even shoot yet so youre left with no ammunition To defend yourself after a while of getting killed So I have to wait a couple hours maybe even the next day to play again
To many cheaters Couldnt play a single session without several

fix your fucking game you have god mode griefers in every session that cant be killed no matter how much fucking damage is poured into them absolutely unplayable trash
fun
Perfect
i think this is a very fun game but its better when you mod
men
its good
Very fun game the Multiplayer is such a good experience if you play in private lobbies because public lobbies are full of modders and griefers and they made it so you can do everything you can do in a public in a private so its much better
it fun
nigger
awsome game and fun to drive around and run from the cops
Online sucks
Unfortunately the online mode for this wonderful game has been ruined by cheaters so if you want a good experience I suggest just modding the story mode and goofing around then just do not become a loser and cheat in this game online you will be proving points on many opinions
good
it is a ok game
The removal of all the cheap speed has made the game either very hard or very boring at the beginning in Online It was an obvious cash grab as almost all the remaining cars start at 1million There are some good guides on the YouTubes or Twitch that will tell you how to navigate the early game The minute they open up another dealership or two and return all the cars removed I cannot in good conscious recommend the game If you do play get friends grind slow and do not buy shark cards
fun
nice
Gta is fun play it I like the free world and free roam world the game is realistic and I be playing FiveM makes it more fun

"The GTA series is beyond reviews  If you do not know what your are getting you have been living under a rock since GTA3  So here is a tip

When you start a new story mode just do the main story missions  When you finish the story you will have plenty of money side missions and things to discover and do to entertain you for a long time  and most importantly the map will be explored"

"It was fun till it lasted When it just came out I played 100s of hours But right now its just unplayable mess and online sessions are filled with cheaters

Do not fcking buy this game to play online You can pirate it for single player because rockstar got too greedy to deserve your dollar IMO"

Naturally this doesnt matter cause GTA V is old but love it Just dont expect controller to work like steam says it does It doesnt 
fun
I think we all know this is a pretty solid game In my opinion it dips and peaks between different eventsDLC they release At this point I dont think it is possible to join a lobby that does not have at least 2 hackersmodders in it Whether or not this is a good or bad thing is subjective I basically pay for the majority of the ingame content with money dropped by modders so you know
very cool and funny4

"GTA V is a game that has quickly become a classic offering a oneofakind openworld gaming experience With an engaging storyline and welldeveloped characters the game offers a story that you can follow through the eyes of three different protagonists

The game is beautifully designed with cinematicquality graphics and an impressive soundtrack The Los Santos environment is large varied and offers an immersive experience you wont want to leave Theres so much to do in the open world of GTA V you could spend hours just exploring biking golfing and more

The multiplayer mode GTA Online is also offered fun providing a different gameplay experience than the singleplayer campaign You can create your own character buy properties run errands participate in heists and many other online activities with your friends

All in all GTA V is an exciting beautifully crafted and actionpacked game that delivers an unforgettable gaming experience With an engaging storyline memorable characters cinematicquality graphics and an outstanding soundtrack this game is a modern classic that every gamer should try If youre looking for an openworld game with a wide variety of things to do GTA V is the game for you"

Fuck Rockstar fuck Tencent the fact that this game is so highly reviewed makes me sad If youre buying the game at this point DONT ESPECIALLY if you plan to use GTA Online Rockstar has proven they do not give a flying fuck about the community I dont care how good GTA6 might be I am not buying it on principle and you shouldnt either
fun game if you dont try online as the first thing you do
Amazing game

I wouldve recommended this game like 5 years ago GTA Online is fucking trash Its sad but not surprising to see that Rockstar took out many vehicles so they can put them in their dumb rotationsie the lucky wheel and ls car meet Im tired of jumping through a million hoops to have fun with this game Dont waste anymore of your time Rockstar for a while has shown time and time again that they dont give a fuck about their player base but it doesnt matter because the game is so massive anyway They will just keep getting away with this shit through the end of this game and probably most of the next one I have lost hope in this franchise that I once loved A message Rockstar Games release GTA 6 and quit milking this game dry you greedy pigs
ye
Its fun
Awesome story memorable characters great openworld game Just finished this game this 2023 12 years after the release of GTA V Now I cant wait to play GTA 6 in 2035 because my laptop will not be able to handle it in its release date 2025
"When I was installing the game I was already banned why because I forgot you arent allowed to go into Public sessions THAT ROCKSTAR ADVERTISES because your the one that gets banned and not the guy with the menu


Dont worry you still can play the game you were promised but not by the people who created it FiveM is a modification for Grand Theft Auto V enabling you to play multiplayer on customized dedicated servers powered by Cfxre"

Sigh
If youve so much as glanced at GTAV on another platform and linked your social account to it the Cockstar social club wont let you log in and youll be told to Log in with a different social club user to continue Apparently the technology to give each steam account a unique ID is too advanced Other users have reported the same issue as well as waiting upwards of two weeks for a response from Cockstars website which even by modern AAA standards is unacceptable If youre fine with owning nothing and being happy this is definitely the game for you
You can run people over
you can punch woman its fun

"Single player is this game is fine It is what youd expect from a single player CrimeLord Game The No review is solely for only the online portion of this game 

Online Gameplay is so extremely Abhorrently reprehensibly awful that is an easy pass While they make starting up as tier 1 in this game difficult as life itself you spend half of the time defending yourself from extremely toxic players some are children and teenagers who have nothing better to do because they have no girlfriend or significant other to be with anyway as a I digress

Toxic players toxic community whaling is essentially required and is pretty much built into the game if you want to do anything that is worth while in this game the BadSport mentality pretty much does nothing to quell people from doing this 

They make the reward so worthless when compared to the risks that YOU DO take in this game Hackers are not punished or reprimanded enough 

Unless RockShart changes MULTIPLE things that I do not like about this game DO NOT SPEND YOUR 60 on it Or ignore my review like many other probably will and risk breaking your equipment or permanent hair loss from it leaving your head in frustration while playing this game"

I only have this stinky game cause a friend bought it for me because they wanted to play with me And it was very sweet of them and of course I play this game if they want to BUT JUST KNOW I wouldnt have bought it on my own so L
Beware of grievers but there wont be too many of them hackers wont get you banned or at least not in my experience Great game worth every penny

"The best game Ive ever played Yes the game contains a few bugs that annoy but the game itself is fun I recommend it to anyone who likes to play second person games especially third person Earning is quite easy when playing with friends maybe harder to do solo missions Im more of a Cs player than a GTA player but now my main game will be GTA V than Cs16 or CsGo

I really recommend the game"

"Weaker characters compared to the previous entries a weaker story lame radio stations a giant empty map and streamlined gameplay that essentially boils down to walk and talk missions escort missions races and heists On repeat

Youre also required to use their shitty 3rd party launcher to run the game which can cause problems if youre trying to run this on a steamdeck or something similar 

The online portion of the game also contains one of the most disgusting and exploitative examples of monetization in a video game 

Overall just a waste of time Youre better off playing any other GTA title"

After years of playing this game across different consoles it has lost playable feeling i cant login in a session and enjoy this game feels like modders and hackers have more fun playing this game than me while i have to sit and grind four hours just to get a car i would like to customize modders hackers can just give them selves money and get what ever they want right then and there you get to meet some modders that make the game fun for acouple of minutes then its gone i miss the golden age of gta 5 not this maybe in the future will have a game thats for the players not for making money mabey

"As an avid gamer and fan of the Grand Theft Auto series I recently embarked on an adrenalinefueled journey through the fictional streets of Los Santos in Grand Theft Auto V GTA V Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this installment creating an openworld masterpiece that leaves players hooked from the very start

The first thing that struck me about GTA V is its stunning visuals and attention to detail The games graphics are simply breathtaking and the vast and diverse landscapes of Los Santos from the bustling urban sprawl to the serene countryside are meticulously crafted The level of immersion is unparalleled as the city feels alive with pedestrians going about their daily routines AIcontrolled cars obeying traffic rules and dynamic weather effects adding to the overall realism

The heart of GTA V lies in its captivating storyline which revolves around three unique protagonists Michael a retired bank robber seeking redemption Franklin a young and ambitious gangster aiming for a better life and Trevor a chaotic and unpredictable character with a dark past The seamless switch between these characters throughout the game allows players to experience the story from various perspectives making it all the more engrossing

Rockstar Games has excelled in creating characters that feel genuine flawed and relatable Their development over the course of the game is nothing short of remarkable drawing players emotionally closer to the narrative The writing is sharp laced with dark humor and unexpected twists that keep players constantly on their toes

What truly sets GTA V apart is the sheer freedom it offers within its openworld environment Players can engage in a plethora of activities from taking on thrilling heists and daring missions to participating in various side quests and recreational endeavors The world is your playground and whether youre racing cars playing golf base jumping or indulging in a game of tennis theres never a dull moment

The games online multiplayer mode Grand Theft Auto Online adds another layer of excitement to the already contentrich experience With regular updates and a thriving community the multiplayer aspect ensures that players will be entertained for countless hours beyond the main storyline

However its worth noting that GTA V is intended for mature audiences due to its explicit content violence and language While it contributes to the authenticity of the games setting parents should exercise caution and consider the games rating before allowing younger players to delve into it

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is an exceptional masterpiece in the gaming industry With its breathtaking graphics engaging narrative and unparalleled freedom it sets the benchmark for openworld gaming experiences Despite being released several years ago GTA Vs enduring popularity speaks volumes about its lasting impact on the gaming community If youre a fan of actionpacked adventures and immersive storytelling this game is an absolute mustplay"

I just bought the Criminal Enterprise Starter Pack installed it launched the game and I didnt receive any of the items"
Ive practically grown up playing this game and it was absolutely flawless on PS4PS5Besides the ridiculous amount of griefers ruining the various businesses for anyone who doesnt have friends to protect them but on PC idk if its just me but the servers seem to be horrible and are prone to glitching as well as just overall crashing Console version 1110 and PC version 610 would still recommend but needs some serious server improvements

successfull game of the history should add a supra on storymode

this is the best game ever storyline is great characters and their own story is the best it is surprising that the came out in 2013 but still has a strong fanbase i would definitely recommend this game
"Whilst the game in itself is fun and the griefers seem to have subsided modders are still rampant and can do serious damage Also way too much content is made available to you at the beginning and it can be extremely overwhelming especially since you arent given an explanation Another thing the game takes an unreasonably long time to load and it often ends up just stuck in a loop of loading and when tabbing out whilst loading in the game may just crash Heist missions have a tendency to crash a lot as well so forget about playing one of the main parts of the game

Singleplayer is ok

All in all Id say get it if its ever in a better state or get another game"
"Its a very nostalgic game for me I remember waiting at my local WalMart to open first thing in the morning  to finally  get the first copy of  GTA 5 back in September 2013 i was 14 years old at the time and this game gave great memories 

Thank you RockStar for making a wonderful game 3"

"Title An Unforgettable Adventure in Los Santos  GTA V Delivers

Review
I cant recommend Grand Theft Auto V enough The open world in this game is absolutely incredible offering endless possibilities for exploration and excitement Whether Im cruising through the bustling streets of Los Santos or venturing into the picturesque countryside the level of detail is simply astounding

The missions in GTA V are nothing short of superb Each one feels unique and brings its own set of challenges and thrills From highspeed heists to heartpounding shootouts the gameplay keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire journey

And lets talk about the graphics  they are mindblowing The attention to detail in every aspect of the game from the character models to the dynamic weather effects truly elevates the gaming experience to a whole new level

Ive spent countless hours in Los Santos and with each playthrough I discover something new and exciting The freedom to make choices coupled with the rich narrative keeps me coming back for more

If youre a fan of openworld adventures and enjoy immersive gameplay GTA V is an absolute mustplay Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this masterpiece So grab your virtual car keys and dive into the world of GTA V  you wont be disappointed"
The game will not unistall and will not stop running

Dont buy it spend your money in other games This game used to run great and I played it for 82 hours Then the social club update came through and I have not been able to play it constant crashes and not starting at all Im done with it and their customer service
Fbi know what you do
Amazing graphics as you all know Also good for wanderers in open world
i hate oppresers
Ah jeez the state of the online just makes me sad It used to be so simple back in the day when the coolest person in the lobby was the dude in the gold helicopter picking everyone up Now its just a hellfire warzone of flying cars with homing rockets and open world missions that cost so much money to do and have such a low payout for the risk involved other players destroying your cargo its just not worth doing Servers are a crap shot and connecting to your friends is a shot in the dark If you live in different parts of the world its a 5050 shot of being able to connect stably to each other Single player is fun tho
its good i fw it
very fun game hackers suck tho
W
yes
Lots of funn
cus it good
cool
single player is S tier but the online only has 2 things to gen money heist or a boring monotonous fetch quest
good
Good game would reccomend
If you pa attention throughout playing the story or campaign there is so many details that most dont notice or dont pay enough attention too and for a game that came out a decade ago its still really good for its time
Online is cool and all but the story is very underappreciated Definitely give it a go
w
It sucks
Veru nice
ok
cant even load it up cuz my pc is shit
Can be fun whit friends but its a very simple game get money buy buisness get more money buy house get money buy car get hella much money buy car whit jet motor attached

Constant problems with servers cant connect with friends and almost always it ends up with the connection lost message After eight years this game is still such a mess
nice
"Havent played this game in over 6 years got back with the criminal pack dlc just recently and played some solo sessions with my mate and had a great time

After a few hours playing solo with him i figured lets go online and see what the folks are up to
Be me in a clothing store minding my own business and some player thought it was a great idea to engage in a fire fight after a few deaths from him flying his little speedy gonzales motorbike i finally sniped the guy and kept on spawn killing him a few times for revenge 
in the middle of that killing spree a hacker decided to kill everyone on the server by spawning something with a grenade launcher that was invincible and just kept on doing that for a solid 510 minutes before the server finally gave up

im happy the playerbase havent changed much since last time i played

1010 would definitely play again"
yes
i love this ganme its so amazing and fun hell yes
my loading screen keeps freezing whenever im tryna load into the game and it just kicks me out

ITS GOOD AS BRUH
"Unraveling the Tapestry of Los Santos Grand Theft Auto V

Score 9410

Rockstar Games Grand Theft Auto V GTA V is a technical marvel and narrative powerhouse that marks a high point in the storied history of openworld gaming This landmark title adeptly weaves a dense tapestry of story action and exploration resulting in a gaming experience that is as provocative as it is fun With a staggering level of depth and breadth GTA V earns an impressive 94 out of 10

GTA Vs primary narrative is an intricate saga of crime and ambition set against the backdrop of the sprawling city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas The plot is made richer by the three protagonists  Michael Franklin and Trevor each with their own distinct personalities and storylines that intertwine brilliantly The games bold choice to allow players to switch between these characters at almost any point is innovative and provides a unique and engaging storytelling mechanism

GTA Vs openworld design is a testament to Rockstars attention to detail and commitment to creating an immersive experience Los Santos is a living breathing city with diverse districts that accurately mirror the multicultural fabric of Southern California From sunkissed beaches and bustling downtown streets to arid desert expanses and towering mountain ranges the world feels alive and is an absolute joy to explore

The gameplay in GTA V offers a perfect balance between chaotic action and strategic planning Whether youre engaging in highoctane car chases meticulously planning and executing heists or simply exploring the city in your downtime the game constantly keeps you entertained The coverbased shooting mechanics feel smooth the driving is satisfyingly responsive and the sheer variety of vehicles and weapons available adds to the games replayability

Graphically GTA V is stunning The level of detail realistic physics dynamic weather and daynight cycle create an aesthetically pleasing and believable world The voice acting is topnotch and the radio stations with their various genres of music and entertaining talkshow segments significantly add to the games atmosphere

Additionally the inclusion of GTA Online provides a robust and continually evolving multiplayer experience where players can engage in a plethora of activities from races and deathmatches to cooperative heists further extending the games lifespan

Nevertheless the game is not without its flaws Some may find the games portrayal of violence and its treatment of certain societal issues controversial Also although GTA Online is a rich addition it occasionally suffers from server issues and an environment that may be unwelcoming to newcomers

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V stands as an exemplar in the realm of openworld games Its engaging narrative meticulously crafted world diverse gameplay mechanics and compelling multiplayer component make it a game that any player can appreciate While not without its minor setbacks and potential controversy the scale and quality of what it offers are undeniable making GTA V a mustplay title in the annals of gaming history"

it wont ducking close its been running for two weeks straight
"Dont know what to tell you the game is underwhelming even disappointing
Im not into MMOonline games and so only played story mode but I feel if you like shooter games there are a ton of superior games if you like you know everything else that supposed to be GTA well this will be disappointing 

The world is barely interactive if at all mechanics junky and frustrating a ton of bugs God knows how many years after release story so so Coming from not having played a lot of action and instead RPGs this has been a sad lament for the great days of GTA San Andreas"
Guys dont worry it is so easy to level up and make cash just find a lobby with a hacker befriend him and youre good

GTA 6 will come out after I die of old age

While online is mostly just a cashgrab pay to win massacre for new players the story mode is absolutely legendary with great story graphics that still look good years later and decent replayability due to it having several different endings also the attention to detail is amazing

i mean its gta so yes its good
Fun as fuck
"I wish that Steam had a meh option as IMO GTA 5 deserves a meh for new players id say its worth buying for the story but online is a bit overwhelming with everything you need to buy in able to start making money for real

The story mode is great and fun to play its always worth playing a Rockstar story mode

The Online has grown extremely stale to me over the years Ill always get in a pattern of loving the game for a month then hating everything about it for 3 months and its been like this for the last 5 years half of its lifespan Ive been either loving online or wanting to play something else and forget that it even exists Not to mention that the prices of everything have skyrocketed in online yet the value of shark cards have stayed the same really 8 mil is not a whole lot anymore

At this point they just need to move on to GTA 6 and let GTA 5 die already"
good game very
Good game entertaining and fun to mess around in
it is so fun of it haves mods
Tried to make an account didnt work cause of a error that says we could not create sign in token

Making a review for gta in 2023 is like women having rights In short a great game but for some reason I order a car in the game and it says that it appears in my parking lot I dont see it at home I go out every day to check and there is no car in my yard I was cheated Im looking forward to my car thank you I also happen to be single so if you are a beautiful Russian woman reading this send me a message
Great game for having fun the biggest problem is almost everything is too expensive

i hate it i was GRINDING THE HELL and then there is a message that says YOU HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR 30 FUCKIN DAYS PLUS THE NEW UPDATE REMOVES SOO MANY CARS I JUST BOUGHT IT 3 DAYS AGO ROCKSTAR i HIGHLY do NOT reccomend this FRIKIN GAME
qt
"Great campaign great open world  The online is also awesome as long as youre free roaming  Once you try entering matchmaking it becomes garbage  Its really fun building your empire in the online space though  way more interesting than it otherwise is in the main story world

As youd expect in a GTA game the driving and car variety is very solid  There are so many things to do and explore that this is possibly the best open world game you can pick up outside of an MMO  Therefore if you have any interest in that genre you should enjoy this"
One of the best games ive had on steam I got it for a cheap price because steam always have a deal for gta its crazy I really recommend it for new player to steam
"I waited so long for GTA VI That my hair is the same color of my teeth
We are tired of waiting"
cant get past the train in the first mission
game was fun until those modders or hacker joined they teleport me everywhere and keep losing money where are the fun anymore man tried to tell me use the mod but i dont find it fun when they can drop me from the sky or putting me in  jail those need to ban the steam account because they would to that to others players in other games trying to ruin other moods when they keep getting shit on in real life so now they throwing tantrums in games on other players jaja i find it funny because its about patience
it is very fun to play with your friends
A fabulous game There is so much of attention to details
Horrible game this is no hood game at all you cant even create terrorist attacks this game petty thief

Do right By right I mean apocalypse cars

Yes
i hate this game best game ive played ngl
GTA 6 will come out in 2026
"It is no longer recommended for any player to play GTAOL to buy this game Its life cycle is basically at the end and the only thing left is lingering and more garbage content We gave Rockstar a couple of year to improve this game and his updated content is getting more and more worse Here is why I dont recommend anyone to buy GTAOL anymore
 Extremely worst online environment
If you go to a public session that is a session where a group of stranger players are together there is a high probability that someone will cheat Even if you hide you will easily encounter cheats such as teleport all players to a cage to kill you You will also be unable to press the game menu due to repeated killings And if you want to play as in private you can avoid it but the premise is that you are not targeted by any cheats otherwise the cheats will always join your session or mission and then continue to send you to the cage to kill or crash your game Even if you never mess with any cheaters you will encounter ballstorture random invitations indiscriminate invitations that last for a year and even forcefully pull players into new sessions And whats Rockstar do anything about this They just simply disabled the function for players to invite public players from private sessions to play missions together At the same time players can no longer search for missions enabled in different sessions it was possible before this update so players have made so many sacrifices presumably the problem of cheating has been well improved As a result at least million cheats that invite harassment and attack players indiscriminately across the server can be found on the internet everywhere 14 of which is ballstorture   This is their attitude towards cheating   They dont even care about cheats that affect the overall situation and the rest of the minor troublemakers are out of their control
 Extreme disgusting update content
If the extremely disgusting environment can be avoided by relying on absolute isolation then the remaining big problem that you absolutely cannot avoid is the update content that is getting more and more disgusting If it is said that last summers ULP series mission update there are at least some additional content to praise hidden contacts auto store classification options yes they dragged it out for almost 10 years but this year there is almost nothing to praise The Worst Jobs of Los Santos Drug Wars Its perfunctory like taking out some small Job separately and then telling us that this is a big update Players who may have never played before dont know what the concept of the usual major task update is If you dont consider the update of PVP content the previous task update is generally Apartment heist Doomsday heist the coolest and most scifi Diamond Casino heist and largescale heist missions such as Cayo Perico heist Apartment heist is the number one benchmark in the 4player cooperation series It can sneak in or force a sudden attack and there are many ways to play And hallucinogens even scored chapters and chapters and the next chapter was delayed for almost half a year and even a difficult mode that is the chance of resurrection was reduced had to be squeezed out for several months Such efficiency is unprecedented and outrageous
Maybe its okay to play these trash mission and you can play some other stuff in the gamesuch as race or sth then the next content is definitely the most disgusting
 Extreme disgusting operation mode
Grand Theft Auto charges related to car theft right the focus is on stealing and cars Auto   In their latest update they deleted nearly 200 cars And that number is still growing What is the reason given by Rockstar Lesserused vehicles will be removed from ingame websites to streamline the browsing experience so Rockstar must be very concerned about the players browsing experience right Oh in addition to deleting nearly 200 cars it is just adding a few categories and then Is there a search by name Are there more filter rules After viewing a cars introduction can I stay at the last browsed position when going back to the previous page instead of browsing from the beginning nothing
A flying motorcycle of 2 million they increased it to EIGHT MILLION after several price increases which is equivalent to do The Cayo Perico Heist at least 5 times in a row and each time it has to be a profit of 18 million equivalent to a single persons exclusive bonus  door glitch  good luck to get the highest value goods enough to fill the backpack you can afford this vehicle if you are not so lucky you have to do The Cayo Perico Heist more times
At the same time I dont know what happening with Rockstar They often launch various garbage missions Not only are the rewards not good but the missions are also not good For example the last Halloween was limited to collect 200 jackolanterns for a week with random effects such as explosions and electric shocks or collect 100 props This way of creating out of print is very disgusting In order to add a little collection value to their perfunctory clothes they engage in this kind of disgusting timelimited collection Whoever does it will be disgusted They forcefully reflect the difficulty of collecting this piece of clothing to add socalled value However I still cant wear it in the mission which is amazing
There is also the mission editor They have more and more restrictions on the mission editor Recently they even added an item blacklist which made most of the interesting playermade maps unplayableAlthough he was scolded back no one can guarantee when he will delete it again
In addition it also limits the players earning speed The most profitable Cayo Perico has added a 3hour CD for singleplayer clearance and a 48minute CD for multiplayer clearance Other largescale jobs have also added a 48minute CD mandatory multiplayer Before the player has fully played some people may think that limiting the earning speed can allow the player to experience this growth process However when faced with a broken gun worth hundreds of thousands more expensive than many real estates most people will not dislike the short CD but only complain about the abnormal inflation in Los Santos After all rockstar knows that it is too easy for players to make money and buy things so they will not buy its GTA members and shark cards
 Endless glitches and crashes
Various benign glitches in this game help players make more money in jobs Vicious glitches such as decrease bullets cause players to lose hundreds of thousands of ammunition costs in vain every time and even game crash and decrease revenue Rockstar will only repair the former and the latter is basically left to the community Fun glitches get fixed and annoying glitches pile up never really getting fixed
Such a worse and disgusting online environment is the only one among so many open worlds and it is getting more and more worse and disgusting And you know what I wouldnt be surprised if a lot of content is exclusive to GTA members a year from now especially the 200 cars that got deleted because thats something that Rockstar would come up with"
Game play and storyline was great
solid game tbh
ya good ensfnsdf
its SUPER realistic and fun to play though i do wish there were more heists and you could steal more things during missions its still very fun
muito bom da pra matar gordo e veia
I LOVE THE STRIP CLUB

its a fun online game
"Its a Hate and love game 

But at its current state I cant recommend it Every multiplayer lobby has at least 1 hackercheater in it Very sad people With the emphasis on AT LEAST"
Im hungry
mum
Its good GTA IV is better though
good gam
I love getting hookers and driving them off the pier
i like it picasso
fun to mess around and do heists and missions although it is pretty hard to progress through the game
Finally a game were I can live out my deepest fantasies Like driving between the lines and listening to the radio WITHOUT paying for gas or being able to afford a house
so i started the game and went right into a public server good idea i was trying to rob a store and a random person come up help me will the game all control how to make money then says we are the only people in here you got a 10 car garage and then gave me 10 duloxos it was a nice start and if you are a modder as well you should go help a new player
kill
it is not worth buying because after i ha dent played GTA for a while it said that i had to reinstall the game when i had it installed and had a mager bug i would not recommend to buy the game I rate it a 35 out of 10
its GTA what else needs to be said
Good good
Very cool game but they should release GTA6
this game is mostly for streamers its what a lot of people want right now so its easy to get into the Youtube or twitch and make money from playing a video game and have fun at the same time

its a great game
After a long 23 hours of wait of download ready to play the game I ended up in the Sign in part Ok sure why not I told myself Signing up my account but then just to be rejected because the account is apparently already linked to their damn social party or whatever that thing is I did not try to even understand or gave it a second what that second verification was about clearly had a rough day already and I am not gonna spend 15 minutes trying to figure out why or why not this account is not eligible Like literally why do we even need theses to play GTA V on solostory mode What are they trying to protect from it via the use of emails or whatever their social group is I just wanna play the game like any other just click and play why does it have to be that complicated for something that is not even multiplayer god damn There is multiplayer but I just went for the normal story mode one Although the game is good Ive played it on my ps4 hopping that I could just play on my computer for 2 hours just to chill Man it was good time when the Ps3 was out there was no accounts or such things as gamepasses Everything was just given in the game since there was no way to put money into it
I Dnt knw why but Game is crashing too much when playing online
this game is so good but dont buy it wait for grand theft auto 6
"once you get into the game it might seem boring at first

way better on pc then other and that you can type in chat
Timeless and exceptional GTA V continues to captivate players even a decade after its release Its vast open world engaging storylines and endless opportunities for mayhem make it an undeniable classic While we eagerly await the potential arrival of GTA VI we recommend diving into the immersive world of Red Dead Redemption 2 RDR2 to satiate your appetite for adventure However its worth acknowledging that some players have expressed concerns about Rockstars monetization practices which may leave a bitter taste for some Nevertheless GTA V remains a mustplay experience for any gaming enthusiast
is a really nice game when you play with 2 Fps on a shit computer

"Rockstar just removed nearly 200 cars from the stores so new player cant get them normally except the lucky wheel which is very rare this both made good lucky wheel cars very rare but also blocking some more competitive cars behind a paywall
If it really was about streamlining the experience many have pointed out that they simply could have added a filter function to the ingame sites for particular classes

overall just a dick move from the game company"

Even though I have substantially more hours than whats on my steam due to the fact Ive played it most on ps3 and xbox one I am sitting here writing my dead to right honest review of GTA 5 Although the overall gameplay experience will change as you go from story mode to online play it is a solid experience Graphics are smooth and stutter free and quite stunning if youre playing on the highest possible settings it is quite enjoyable even if you have to settle with lower graphics I myself am playing on the highest possible settings with my ASUS TUF gaming laptop it has NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1650 graphics card and AMD Ryzen 5 4600H processor and 32 GB ram aftermarket custom job as the laptop orginally only has 8GB but upgrade was nessecary to play newer games without issues so if you have a computer either a tower or laptop with similar or higher specs  you are more than capable of playing GTA 5 and enjoying the experience as you go along Story is detailed and rich in different ways you can take to reach the same goal added bonus is that you have three characters to choose from and 3 different endings of story mode when you get that far Loads of possibilities as in how you play the game and spend your time if you either want to go full sandbox and stunt cars planes helicopters or a BMX bite along the mountain side  litteraly only thing stopping you is your own imagination same goes with online play  wanna go full rampage mode or settle down with owning businesses and earning big bucks by owning a night club etc the choice is yours But there is a big but here Online play can be good and it can be just as bad lots of toxic players and just the same amount of hackers and cheaters However there is a work around to play online mode and not being lobbied with tons of these by using the resource monitor methode use google and watch how it is done I myself am fond of that and have been enjoying online play even more ever since I found out about that The game is full of surprises and as said earlier the only thing stopping you is your own imagination Theres a million different ways to play and if you like the game as much as I have you will loose lots of hours on it Bon voyage and enjoy

Got this game before the release of GTA 6 to fell it out while it was on steam sale this became easily one of my most favorite games the game looks great even though it was released about 10 years ago the main story is good and the 100 is enjoyable However the best part of the game is the simple act of CARS driving and customizing them is the greatest I have ever played with"

Amazing
"Grand Theft Auto V is a masterpiece of openworld gaming showcasing Rockstar Games unparalleled ability to create immersive exhilarating and sometimes controversial experiences Released years ago it remains an enduring classic that has stood the test of time captivating players with its dynamic storytelling breathtaking visuals and endless possibilities for chaotic fun

The narrative of Grand Theft Auto V revolves around three distinct protagonists Michael a retired bank robber living a life of luxury Franklin a streetsmart hustler eager for bigger opportunities and Trevor an unhinged psychopathic criminal with a penchant for chaos Their lives intertwine in a gripping tale of heists betrayal and selfdiscovery drawing players deep into the dark underbelly of Los Santos

From the moment you set foot in the sprawling city of Los Santos it becomes apparent that Rockstar has spared no expense in crafting a visually stunning world The attention to detail is unparalleled with bustling streets picturesque landscapes and vibrant characters breathing life into every corner of the game The level of realism is astonishing making you feel like youre an active participant in a living breathing metropolis

One of the key highlights of Grand Theft Auto V is its immense openworld freedom Players are presented with a vast playground where they can engage in an assortment of activities ranging from adrenalinepumping heists and highspeed police chases to more casual endeavors like golf tennis and stock market trading The plethora of side missions and minigames keeps players entertained for hours on end

The humor and satire embedded in the games dialogue and radio stations add a layer of wit and charm to the experience Rockstars ability to mock various aspects of modern society politics and popular culture in an entertaining way is commendable albeit often controversial

However its worth noting that Grand Theft Auto V is rated M for Mature for a reason The game is not suitable for younger audiences due to its intense violence explicit language and adult themes Parents should exercise caution and be mindful of the games content

Despite its brilliance the game is not without some minor flaws The occasional mission difficulty spikes and overly aggressive police AI can be frustrating but they hardly detract from the overall enjoyment

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V remains a landmark in gaming history setting a standard for openworld games that few have matched Its engrossing narrative impeccable graphics and an abundance of activities make it an unforgettable experience If you have the stomach for mature content and are eager to explore a virtual world like no other Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute mustplay"

very good
it fun to chase down other players and then scream the house down when karma smacks me
Super Fun Definitely Buy This Game
"Its not as good as I expected
The cars handle poorly and so do the characters on foot
It takes way too much space on the hard drive and wont work without a designated launcher
Even many years after the premiere its still very buggy cars disappear from the garage characters glitch through the floor and camera tends to clip through walls
The environments are pretty bland especially the city
Things that deserve praise the game is pretty easy it runs smooth the graphics are nice and its compatible with Windows 10
Overall its missing a lot of charm that previous games in the series had but its a decent driving simulator
Update Theres lots of fun mods to improve the game That makes it worth it"
very nice game do recommend highly

Grand Theft Auto V Where traffic rules are suggestions chaos is a lifestyle and jaywalking is an extreme sport Buckle up for a joyride of mayhem and mischief with more stolen cars than a kids toy box Trevor the poster boy for What in the world moments steals the show with his unique brand of crazy If life gives you lemons Michael Franklin and Trevor will probably hijack a fruit truck Welcome to Los Santos where pedestrians have the agility of Olympic sprinters and the driving skills of well toddlers Its a game that proves mayhem and laughter go hand in hand one stolen taco truck at a time

GTA V is a game that Ive known about since it launched but I havent really been able to play it until around 3 years ago when I got it on console After buying it for PC and playing through single player again this is what I have to say The main storyline is fairly solid though a bit convoluted and has a lot going on which is kind of expected when there are 3 main protagonists Although its still fun engaging and worth your time in my opinion The online mode on the other hand is a bit of a shitshow For one its very grindy as the payouts for missions and business sales are very low compared to the vehicle and property prices Another issue is modders who can either ruin your session or lead to a lot of silliness and fun times and theres almost no inbetween And with a recent update Rockstar removed around 180 vehicles from the websites For reference the game had somewhere around 700 vehicles before the update That aside there are some fun things you can do like rob stores play PvP mess around with your friends or random people etc All said this game still holds up pretty well nearly 10 years on and I think its worth the money especially if you get in on sale
i love this game mostly for five m
good soup
good game
story mode on top 50 of online players are modders
Singleplayer is alright Online is dogshit Toxic community wouldnt even let a level 3 do anything They just repeatedly kill you over and over till you uninstall The passive mode in RDRO is 1000x better then this trash
FCK GTA AND FCK ROCKSTAR LET THIS GAME DIE
Yes Specific brain usage needed
In hindsight the story isnt all that memorable IV is definitely the better game and the 3d trilogy certainly have better stories and settings they just kinda play like dogballs In summation GTA 5 is ok I wouldnt spend more than like 15 probably
ok

"Chilli con carne recipe

if youre looking for a review on this game youve come to the wrong place but if youre looking for an outstanding Chilli con carne recipe youve come to the right place

Ingredients

1 large onion
1 red pepper
2 garlic cloves
1 tbsp oil
1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp if you only have mild

1 tsp paprika
1 tsp ground cumin
500g lean minced beef
1 beef stock cube
400g can chopped tomatoes
½ tsp dried marjoram
1 tsp sugar or add a thumbnailsized piece of dark chocolate along with the beans instead see tip

2 tbsp tomato purée
410g can red kidney beans
plain boiled long grain rice to serve
soured cream to serve

Directions

STEP 1
Prepare your vegetables Chop 1 large onion into small dice about 5mm square The easiest way to do this is to cut the onion in half from root to tip peel it and slice each half into thick matchsticks lengthways not quite cutting all the way to the root end so they are still held together Slice across the matchsticks into neat dice

STEP 2
Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways remove stalk and wash the seeds away then chop Peel and finely chop 2 garlic cloves

STEP 3
Start cooking Put your pan on the hob over a medium heat Add 1 tbsp oil and leave it for 12 minutes until hot a little longer for an electric hob

STEP 4
Add the onion and cook stirring fairly frequently for about 5 minutes or until the onion is soft squidgy and slightly translucent

STEP 5
Tip in the garlic red pepper 1 heaped tsp hot chilli powder or 1 level tbsp mild chilli powder 1 tsp paprika and 1 tsp ground cumin

STEP 6
Give it a good stir then leave it to cook for another 5 minutes stirring occasionally

STEP 7
Brown 500g lean minced beef Turn the heat up a bit add the meat to the pan and break it up with your spoon or spatula The mix should sizzle a bit when you add the mince

STEP 8
Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 minutes until all the mince is in uniform mincesized lumps and there are no more pink bits Make sure you keep the heat hot enough for the meat to fry and become brown rather than just stew

STEP 9
Make the sauce Crumble 1 beef stock cube into 300ml hot water Pour this into the pan with the mince mixture

This game is gas in a can Like the good kind I will say that playing online is a bit toxic but going into passive mode or crew session relieves that
"GTA Story Mode Bunch of extra things you can do but mainly gets boring after you complete the story You can go 100 and get all the objectives on missions but with the checkpoints denying objectives among other things making 100ing pretty titedous

GTA Online More fun to play alone when wanting cash less fun to mess with other players very fun to play with friends

Mods FiveM LSPDFR they are a good reason to get this game but maybe for the game to be on sale

Overall GTA is pretty cool but has its weakspots"
Problem open
this game reminds me of GTA V

hi

why was it possible before and not now

for pc transfer

i guess ill have to get a refund on steam and let every one else know so they dont accidentally purchase it if they want to transfer their account

its pretty much pointless then

have allot of cash invested then i buy the game again and Im out all the money and the purchase doesnt seem like a good business practice by rockstar the better business bureau may not appreciate it either Im guessing"
this game is 100 malware once you get online peer to peer servers let hackers do whatever they want to you and your pc and theres nothing rockstar can or will do about it if you want to play a rockstar game online just get a console version they can do scripts but they cant do the various bullshit with menus they do on here honestly kind of insane that this game doesnt have any way to protect you and also forces you to do open world missions with these people in every damn lobby

Grand Theft Auto V had the potential to be an exhilarating gaming experience like it was on previous gen game consoles but my personal encounter left me disappointed The unjustified ban I received without any reason was a major setback making me question the integrity of the games online system Moreover the pervasive paytowin elements within the game detracted from its overall enjoyment Regrettably these factors overshadowed the games potential for greatness

"I have played this game over and over Driving flying stealth shooting and feeling like you can live another life is highly entertaining the online coop is fantastic and the developers occasionally adding new content keeps it fresh

Although I am not a fan of profanity and sexual content the game is full with a lot more than that which makes it a super fun experience for me

Thank goodness this game was made when it was because at least you dont need a supercomputer to run it like RDR2"

Yeeah so how did this happen huh

Also thanks for update that removed loads of vehicles from game just a bit after my game crashed and my main character was resetted
As i contacted support they simply said they dont make backups of those
Now imagine losing character over 500 levels with all garages almost full of vehicles not to mention bunkers facilities airports drug lockups guns nightclub and of course the damn time that went to achieve all that

As of that i will never again buy any Rockstar games"

Wow writing a Steam review for GTA V in 2023 somethings never change Well Ive been playing this since it came out and online didnt even exist Lets talk post release shall we Online has been a major success the story is just a faster way to load into the game now sorta Lets talk about the goods since release of online play theres been so much added from property and vehicles to the actual content and missions even just customizing your character and running businesss like some sort of tycoon lots to come back for every so often Unfortunately every good comes with a bad from missions lagging out or your game just all out disconnecting and kicking you out to stare at steam library stage I have even had missions all out not pay me after completing the objectives This is especially annoying because everything in this game is so damn expensive and I cant for any reason understand why For any new car youll need to complete at least 2 heists to afford it and thats assuming everyones either down to not get paid more or down to give you more money than the other 3 members Im of course talking about the 3 other people youre doing a heist with Unfortunately hackers and modders are the real troopers keeping this game alive almost every lobby you join will have at least one Normally you just have to wait out 20 minutes of them murdering you and sweet talk them in public chat and theyll give ya a hand out or at least let you ride around in their modded vehicle wreaking havoc Anyways having spent the past 2 weeks just really grinding out this game in slew of excitement for the GTA VI announcement trailer I find myself enjoying the game a lot
Never gets OLD

"First 5 minutes online and I cant even make a character because some idiot decided to troll by somehow parking a car upside down in the same spot where the character is created making it impossible to see

The trolling is so stupidly high that you cant even get into the game RIP GTA5 Online because your system is a complete joke as is your business practices if you cant even keep such a stupid thing from happening

Really though dont expect help either Rockstar support is nonexistent I know the game is old but really Korean games have better quality support and thats saying something"

COMMON SHOOT PEOPLE AND ROB FCKERS NOTHING BETTER
Keeps crashing on loading screen Greatest game ever 
very fun game would recommend to any avid anarchist criminal or psychopath
Rockstar has ruined their own game with greed  exclusive updates for console Every step of the way they make it difficult for users There is no excuse for the lack of cross platform or original character migration from console Removing cars from the ingame websites to repackage later as New Weak security measures on Social Club The list could go on

"GTA V History  GOAT

GTA V Online requirements  play with 3 or more friends  GOAT"

"GTA 5 also known as Grand Theft Auto V is not just a game its a wild rollercoaster ride through the world of crime and mayhem with a dash of hilarity thrown in for good measure If youve ever wanted to live out your wildest criminal fantasies without any reallife consequences this game is your golden ticket But beware because chaos and comedy go hand in hand in Los Santos

First off lets talk about the characters Michael Trevor and Franklin form a trio thats as dysfunctional as a broken joystick Michael is the retired bank robber with family issues Trevor is the psychopath with a twisted sense of humor and Franklin is just trying to make a name for himself Their interactions are like a neverending episode of a crimebased sitcom and their banter will have you laughing out loud between heists

But its not just the characters that bring the comedy gold The openworld environment of Los Santos is an absolute playground for the mischievous You can steal cars run over pedestrians cause massive explosions and even go skydiving while dressed as a chicken Yes you read that right The sheer absurdity of the side activities and random encounters is worth the price of admission alone

And lets not forget about the radio stations Whether youre cruising in a stolen sports car or evading the cops the radio will never let you down The satirical talk shows ridiculous commercials and catchy tunes make driving around the city an absolute joy Ive lost count of how many times Ive found myself laughing hysterically at the witty commentary or dancing in my chair to some 80s power ballad while being chased by the police

Of course theres also the online mode where you can team up with friends or complete strangers to cause even more chaos together From crazy races where the laws of physics seem optional to heists that require a level of coordination thats equal parts hilarious and frustrating its a multiplayer experience unlike any other

Now its important to mention that GTA 5 isnt just about the laughs It also boasts a gripping story that delves into the dark underbelly of crime and greed But lets be real most of us are here for the wacky shenanigans and the joy of pushing the boundaries of whats possible within the games virtual world

In the end GTA 5 is a game that doesnt take itself too seriously It embraces the ridiculousness of its own existence and invites players to join in on the fun If youre looking for a hilarious actionpacked adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end grab your controller buckle up and get ready for a ride thats as crazy as it is unforgettable Just remember its all fun and games until you accidentally run over a cow and end up with a fivestar wanted level Good luck and enjoy the mayhem"

"I may be able to like the game if it worked From the beginning the game has crashed at random times in different ways from D3D errors to full computer crashes I contacted RockStar support after a couple days I got a canned response which did not help in any way RockStar Supports website has an issue that does not allow dxdiag or msinfo to be uploaded though they asked for it Instead of replying and seeking a solution the best solution was found on the the internet but it did not fix the issue entirely RockStar Support has never replied to my open ticket though I have replaied every couple days 8 days later the game crashed and is now not loading the title screen at all

In all the 17 hours Ive played there have been a maybe 2 hours playtime before a crash Some of it was trying to make the game playable but most was trying to play the game only to have it crash on me"

"Probably one of the few people that bought this game over 7 times though a few times it was as gifts for others Anyway is GTA 5 worth playing in 2023 Even more so with GTA 6 coming around the corner soon Simple answer my friends Yes  ATM Id recommend getting the Series XS versions or the PS5 versions as theres a few features that arent currently on GTA Online for PC That said even having that Im still playing this on PC GTA Online isnt what it was in 2013 and theres more than enough to do if youre wondering about that

Strongly recommend playing with friends"

"Grand Theft Auto V a game that has become a timeless classic continues to captivate players with its enjoyable gameplay multiplayer experience and impressive graphics As someone who has spent countless hours exploring the streets of Los Santos I find myself drawn to the fun and immersive world that GTA V offers

One of the standout aspects of GTA V is its multiplayer mode Grand Theft Auto Online The ability to join forces with friends and engage in various activities from heists to races adds an extra layer of excitement and camaraderie The multiplayer component has undoubtedly contributed to the games longevity and replayability

Visually GTA V impresses with its detailed and vibrant graphics The sprawling city of Los Santos comes to life with its bustling streets breathtaking landscapes and meticulously designed environments Rockstar Games attention to detail is commendable and it enhances the overall immersive experience of the game

In terms of storytelling GTA V initially stood out with its compelling narrative and memorable characters The intertwining stories of Michael Franklin and Trevor offered a diverse perspective and added depth to the game However as time has passed the storytelling has somewhat lost its impact and it feels like the game could benefit from fresh ideas and a new installment

Looking ahead its clear that the GTA franchise needs to evolve While GTA V has undoubtedly been a monumental success the anticipation for GTA 6 and the promise of new and exciting features is growing Players are eager for Rockstar Games to introduce innovative gameplay mechanics a captivating storyline and even more immersive graphics in the next installment

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V remains an incredibly enjoyable game particularly when played with friends and taking advantage of the vast multiplayer world Its stunning graphics and initially compelling storytelling have left a lasting impression However as the franchise moves forward the anticipation for GTA 6 and the hope for fresh experiences and advancements in the series continue to grow"

committing mass genocide is enjoyable

"Ive been only playing the online and holy crap is a clusterduck in the worst sense this game has been in service for over 10 years I expected something good but instead you have an online where everyone has ducking cheat menus and who also everyone is just a wanabe buttface theres ducking inflation in the economic system so you have to grind for days to buy a ducking vehicle all ducking missions are unstable as ducking duck the room either dies or the game crashes for some poor soul you waste all your ducking day preparing some ducking heist which ends up loosing the fun since youve played it a millon duckig times already in the same ducking way the other ways to get money is with business missions which is the most unfun thing Ive ever played in my ducking life

This game is not even fun with friends is just frustrating is annoying if you think you deserve some kind of punishment in your life because its not bad enough then play the online mode of this ducking game playing it is like working in a job you ducking hate but you dont want to leave because you got already used to it

I regret wasting my time with this ducking game holy ducking god

Dont make the same mistake as me

Cmon its GTA V how can you give this a bad review

funny gangster game 
Good Game
Story is the highlight of the game Online has become more HACKERS ZONE and is constantly overrun by pay to win bozos and hackers
So Youve just got GTA 5 Whats it like you might ask Well The story mode is phenomenal and is a breathtaking experience and GTA online is truly a new experience Whilst it does have its downsides it is easily made up by sheer amount of quality content in this game And for that It deserves a 10

loved its graphics
best chidhood game

like the game
The single player game is fantastic
"Main Game is worth the price  But multiplayer is not 
Due to Decline in players making it impossible to earn cash unless you grind for months 


Grand Theft Auto V Main Game

Grand Theft Auto V developed by Rockstar Games is a masterfully crafted openworld actionadventure game that takes players on an unforgettable journey through the crimeridden streets of Los Santos Bursting with an immersive narrative captivating characters and a vast open world to explore this game delivers an exceptional singleplayer experience that truly sets the bar high

One of the standout features of Grand Theft Auto V is its engaging storyline The game follows the lives of three distinct protagonists each with their own quirks motivations and gripping story arcs From the explosive heists to the personal struggles of the characters the main game weaves a compelling narrative that keeps players hooked from start to finish The attention to detail in both the dialogue and the environment is staggering creating an incredibly realistic and immersive world

The openworld setting of Los Santos is a remarkable feat of game design From the bustling city streets to the vast countryside the level of detail and variety is aweinspiring Whether youre exploring the urban sprawl or embarking on a scenic drive through the countryside theres always something to discover or experience The world feels alive filled with countless activities side missions and secrets to uncover making every playthrough a unique adventure

The gameplay mechanics in Grand Theft Auto V are polished and satisfying Whether youre engaging in intense gunfights driving highspeed vehicles or executing meticulously planned heists the controls feel tight and responsive The wide range of weapons vehicles and customization options further enhance the gameplay allowing players to tailor their experience to their preferences

Grand Theft Auto V Multiplayer

While the main game of Grand Theft Auto V shines brightly the multiplayer component Grand Theft Auto Online presents a more mixed experience While it initially burst onto the scene with immense popularity its worth noting that the player count has been dwindling over time

The multiplayer aspect of Grand Theft Auto V offers a sprawling open world that allows players to engage in various activities with others From completing missions and heists together to participating in adrenalinefueled races and competitive challenges there is no shortage of content to enjoy The ability to create and customize your own character also adds a personal touch to the experience

However the declining player count is an issue that can affect the overall enjoyment of the multiplayer aspect Finding a full lobby or enough players to engage in certain activities can become increasingly challenging especially as time goes on This can result in occasional lulls in the gameplay experience and may limit the opportunities for dynamic interactions with other players

In addition to the concerns about the dwindling player count in Grand Theft Auto Online its important to note that the multiplayer experience also faces criticism for its economy The ingame currency GTA is notoriously difficult to earn particularly due to the declining player base This can lead to frustrating and timeconsuming grinding for players who wish to accumulate wealth and purchase desirable items within the game

To mitigate this issue Rockstar Games introduced microtransactions that allow players to purchase Shark Cards with realworld money providing an influx of GTA to expedite progress While this option can be appealing for those looking to bypass the lengthy grind it has sparked debates about the games reliance on realworld cash transfers to attain ingame wealth

The heavy emphasis on microtransactions and the scarcity of ingame currency opportunities can create an imbalance between players who choose to invest real money and those who do not This monetization strategy has garnered mixed reactions from the player community with some feeling that it hampers the overall experience and favors players with deeper pockets

Its important to mention that Grand Theft Auto Online does offer various ways to earn GTA through ingame activities such as heists missions and races However the challenge of accumulating wealth can be a deterrent for players who seek a more balanced and accessible progression system

While the multiplayer aspects reliance on microtransactions and the difficulty in earning ingame currency can be a downside its worth noting that the core gameplay mechanics and activities within Grand Theft Auto Online still provide entertainment and opportunities for collaboration with other players

Overall the multiplayer component of Grand Theft Auto V while facing issues of dwindling player count and a challenging economy still offers engaging gameplay and a platform for cooperative experiences However the game would greatly benefit from finding a better balance between realworld cash transfers and ingame progression ensuring a fair and enjoyable experience for all players regardless of their financial investments

Despite this issue Grand Theft Auto Online still offers a wealth of content for those who can find active lobbies or play with friends Additionally Rockstar Games has been known to release regular updates and new content keeping the multiplayer experience fresh and exciting"
Best game Ive ever played Loading time taken for the online sessions is the only issue that I noticed
nice game
The game is fun but there are downsides Cheater in every session and random crashes when entering buildings Only playable in closed friend sessions
You can watch a dog get high on weed

Very beautiful and great game 
good game i like shooting hookers
bad
Gotta be honest This is the worst GTA story ever Trevor is so onenote Mike is a terrible satire of Tony Soprano Franklin is the only character worth playing How many times do we have to have a mission in the same construction site Yes i know that was 10 years ago GTA Online is like swatting flies away from a turd pile the flies being cheatersexploiters the turd being the experience as a whole I refuse to do three hour prep for a heist that will barely pay for anything

"alt tabbing during a loading screen takes breaks the game

Edit loading screens take so long I got kicked for inactivity IN A LOADING SCREEN
Rockstar games is worth Billions with a B fix your game youve been milking for a fucking decade

Edit Cant do online heists because you need to own something first whether that be a Hanger bunker or casino Which cost millions each But you cant do open world missionsevents to earn money because someone who has done every heist and has hundreds of billions will pay to make themselves invisible on the mini map and drone strike you with a flying motor bike or A10 and the counter to those is a missle launcher that costs 75000 unless you grind the same mini games that pay 10K or the same DAX missions that pay 20K tops over and over and over until you can afford to buy the prerequisite to play the fucking game or just pray a modder Tps the entire lobby into a small area and drops money Then you are doomed to being bullied by people with no option to fight back Also 3 fucking minutes before youre kicked for inactivity Im so sorry that Im taking up valuable space on your servers rockstar games Ik a small indie company like you is really struggling to keep the servers online Not like youre worth Billions and make MILLIONS off this game every day and nearly a billion a year"

"Circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle inside circle

Three overhead signal sources three characters where one is able to eclipse another three mountains three aligned beacons fourth is inactive and only two light sources that intersect one another Only one time at a birds eye angle would one see a flipped side of a triangle Its all about taking a look

Flipped everything would move differently as the days go by at the second day at the same time it would be further than before Two light sources are both aligned directly from whatever place you draw a line as in order for one to move both have to move together When the dark light falls the shape that ends at the right destination this is when the signal is set to active The signal would be circulating and vibrating differently as you enter a sound zone Even then it is hard to communicate Light sources specifically are not important what they do at the dotted space is Casting a light at an object that casts a dark light

An egg that looks like an eye has to rise and stay close at the right source of dark light Everything can cast a dark trail It shouldnt penetrate the circular hole instead it must wait As one waits another stands at the square of answers while another follows a trail of dark light Only when the air is white can the trail cast strongly and extremely visibly Think of it as a black square

And so it is kept The light source moves accordingly and at a split time shall the signal come to be There is another light source where it only starts fading away An egg is stationary and it is so The hole is also stationary and it is so Fading away light source is behind you a light source that is always there emerges itself from the darkness that is light An egg shall stay near the hole and so a circle shall cast another circle hole right at a dotted space Then shall you see and hear the answer you were looking for With all the overhead sources the practice is the same only one must be aroused near the hole and then perhaps it shall go through it 

A circle inside a circle inside a circle is only a circle inside a circle inside a circle where a circle inside a circle inside a circle actually looks to be a circle inside a circle inside a circle It is a matter of perspective and where a circle inside a circle inside a circle actually is Where you see a circle inside a circle inside a circle is also important as largest circle may move and you will miss a time window When everything is done when a signal from the hole with an egg near it comes through at the end shall a harmonic circle where everybody stays appear and cast a relaxing light of pleasure at a plug A plug is sharp a plug is the top of a blocky object at the middle A large hole shall sit down on a plug and lazer beam a big ball and it shall crack Crawl inside and see the truth One large ball split in half is actually an entrance Get in climb on in Inside a light of gold everywhere a majestic light of high performance intensity and at the very middle Another egg A big chocolate egg you can eat forever You can lick an egg with your tongue You are free to do it slowly an egg is looked after it wont melt Do it slowly for intense but prolonged pleasure Pull out your tongue hard and start sucking An egg is tasty but

Ive only played the story mode so far and will probably update this review when I have more experience but this game is incredible

Its awesome do some assasination type jobs or just rob a jewelery or pretend to be high way patroll just to steal two cars from two little spoiled idiots and then just chill with Treeevaaaa in his hangar preparing to blast another MC club D  Trevor Philips executive solutions TPES Industries providing high quality product and also cater a crack bodyguard team of former special forces So yes we are in the Empire business tow a car ram a armored car steal jewelery cook the finest meth using strictly Methylamine precursor method P2P and Mr Phillips is proud to say that there is one kitchen and its toxic fumes are going day and night with the concurency crippled its just a matter of time when TPhillips executive solutions will be the only viable source of quality and quantity since we almost cancelled every concurention in the region and listen Exsolutions is killing it and we are not some corner boys either we sell weight in bulk and nobody can say a word so next quartal we are starting to recruit willing mercs who have the skills to guarantee the lab and other infrastructures safety MR Philips has some business in Los Santos too and while he is there we need a PMC hired former spetznaz mosad MI5 MI6 CIA all are welcome to join but we pay fixed monthly provide the weapons but the PMC has to logisticali put a fully loaded body guard we recommend silencer shotguns very discreet has the power to throw a 90kg person on impact to the wall so we have some details to sort and after that we will have a big truck plus a Leopard Tank in case smb would be snitching so we can handle the PoPos the 5O the blue cunts or as I call them thugs with badges with ricens to kill D Try us I will on the roof the the RPG ready to fuck the chop pa finish  of the rest of the heroes with MG 40 which should dog the shit out of them blue asses fat fucks  So TPhillips industries contacts we will be happy to accommodate multiple illicit shit from UNCLE FESTERS COOCK BOOK

"I played this game for years on console and just got it for my pc They have a really good sale right now thats honestly a steal I pretty much have everything that I had grinded for before without doing it all over again
I recommend not playing on public sessions starting out there are A LOT of griefers trolls and hackers Do friends only or private Get FiveM n try some moddedrp servers if your into that They be super fun"
i dont recommend it because i got 2 pieced by an npc but fun game and i love making realistic gore videos in gta
I guess Ive been slowly building my empire so to speak I recommend the game to anyone who wants to spend one to two hours daily building up your business It takes a while but when they take off the games gets going

the strip club and hookers make this game good and the only reason i play it
"Grand Theft Auto V GTA 5 is a game thats like attending a wedding where everyones drunk theres a llama in the punch bowl and the bride just stole a helicopter And somehow thats what makes it absolutely glorious

In the wide sundrenched bulletriddled world of Los Santos youll experience life as a retired criminal trying to enjoy his golden years Too bad these golden years involve more highspeed chases explosions and questionable life choices than an action movie marathon

At its core GTA 5 is about freedom The freedom to drive like a maniac to spend your hardearned or stolen cash on militarygrade firepower to run a multimillion dollar criminal enterprise And lets not forget the freedom to parachute from a plane in a chicken suit because why not

Playing as Michael feels like starring in your own reality TV show where youre constantly one step away from a mental breakdown As Franklin youre hustling and grinding your way to the top all while dealing with the most comically dysfunctional friends imaginable And then theres Trevor sweet psychotic Trevor Spending a day in his shoes is akin to attending a nonstop adrenalinefueled party at a madhouse

Despite its age GTA 5 is still a riotous romp that refuses to age gracefully Its the party animal whos still chugging shots while everyone else has long since passed out The graphics still hold up the soundtrack is eclectic and the city of Los Santos is as lively and unpredictable as ever

Is it perfect Nope Youll probably end up hammering your keyboard at least once when you fail a mission because you accidentally ran over a pedestrian got a wanted level and then were promptly obliterated by the police But thats all part of the chaotic charm

n conclusion if youve ever wanted to experience the thrill of a highspeed police chase from the comfort of your own home GTA 5 is the game for you Just remember in Los Santos the only rules are the ones you break Now if youll excuse me I need to head back into the game My pet mountain lion Mr Fluffy gets antsy if I leave him in the car too long And trust me you havent seen chaos until youve seen a bored mountain lion in a virtual city"
good game problem is there are a lot of hackers on online you can play this game on a low end laptoppc and it will still be able to run fine
idk lol

"GTA Online is tons of fun but the hackermodder issue is out of control Modders can mess with you in many ways  force you out of your apartment bunker nightclub etc to take out everyone in the session  Randomly blow you up while youre on missions or even force your game to crash and kick you from the session 

Overall I love GTA Online and Ive had a lot of fun with it but the hacker issue is slowly but surely ruining the experience"
love it
Good
use a vpn for protection against modders we can see your ip as easy as clicking on your profile lol
fun with fiveM
Love this game but gta online is getting kinda boring right now with the new DLC Times were better when the diamond casino heist or the cayo perico heist came out Hell even the doomsday heist was a great time for gta online Now its just abunch of futuristic stuff thats ruining the game Rockstar please fix

"Always enjoyed this game from the time it released originally played on Xbox 360 and continued on Xbox One Just got it for PC a few weeks ago and put in a bunch of hours already 

Works fantastic on PC aside from a few glitches here and there The draw distance is the best its been so far on the three consoles I played it on I especially love that you can do any type of job now on an invite only so Im not constantly plagued by griefers which was a problem for almost 9 years

HI

This game has been out for years and people still play it to this day Some people dont even realize how long its been out because this very game could be played on an Xbox 360 and PS3 Another thing is this game still has online stuff and hasnt been shutdown yet due to all the players the game gets daily sure there are many other games people can play but this one is just special
I LIKE TO KILL PEOPLE IN GTA5
I cannot give this game a positive review until Red Dead Online is given some much needed updates

This game is one of the greatest masterpieces of our generation It has complex rpg and teamwork elements and a captivating and emotional story The pacing is perfect and there are just enough plot twists to make each one feel meaningful Furthermore the puzzles are amazing and scale perfectly Each one gets you thinking but none are ever so difficult that you have to look it up Its graphics are stunning and are truly a next gen experience Even with the amazing graphics it still runs well on almost all computers with high fpsThis is the best game to ever come out on steam and possibly the best video game that has ever been released

No I would not recommend this game Rockstar continues to BREAK the game after 10 years on top of milking the fk out of the money they produce from it Have an easy way to make money Nerf Want to call your car in Nahhhh well break it this update Wanna enter buildings Nahhh well break that too Loadings times are still god fking awful big game or not I shouldnt have a 9 out of 10 chance to get an infinite loading screen There are 32 players in every lobby and 16 of them are guaranteed to have HacksMods and no anticheat to combat it We also decided to remove half the content of the game for God knows what reason and it didnt help anything at all The real question is what baboon did Rockstar hand an IPad to that points at the next dumb idea on it and Rockstar goes Sure lets implement that ffs do not spend money on this game ever

"Its not what is once was When I first played this game I was completely addicted because of how much fun it was but it no more than a shell of its former self nowdays
Now it is a broken buggy mess full with cheaters and modders Even with a high end PC the game will lag me out of heists selling goods and other prep missions I do not know if it is a strategy for restricting how fast one can grind money And dont get me started on the modders They will ruin the last bit of fun that there was to this game unfortunately"

Its gta if youre looking at the reviews youre a dumb fuck what do you expect
"Grand Theft Auto V is an extraordinary video game that has truly pushed the boundaries of openworld gaming delivering an unparalleled experience of crime chaos and adventure Developed by Rockstar Games this masterpiece has captivated millions of players worldwide including myself with its stunning visuals immersive gameplay and an intricately woven storyline

From the moment you step foot into the sprawling metropolis of Los Santos you are instantly transported into a living breathing world that feels incredibly authentic The attention to detail is unparalleled with meticulously designed landscapes bustling city streets and a diverse cast of characters that make the games universe feel vibrant and alive

One of the standout features of Grand Theft Auto V is its three playable protagonists Michael a retired bank robber seeking redemption Franklin a streetsmart hustler looking for a way out of his deadend life and Trevor a volatile psychopath with a penchant for chaos Each character brings a unique perspective to the game and their intertwined narratives create a compelling and engaging storyline that keeps you hooked from start to finish

The gameplay mechanics in GTA V are exceptional offering a seamless blend of driving shooting and exploration Whether youre engaging in highspeed pursuits engaging in thrilling heists or simply wandering the streets causing mayhem the controls are intuitive and responsive providing a satisfying sense of control The ability to switch between characters at any time adds a layer of depth and strategic planning allowing you to approach missions from different angles

One cannot discuss Grand Theft Auto V without mentioning its online multiplayer mode Grand Theft Auto Online It is a living everevolving world where players can create their own criminal empire team up with friends participate in thrilling missions and compete in a wide range of activities The sheer scope of content and the constant updates and additions by Rockstar Games ensure that there is always something new to explore and experience

Furthermore the games soundtrack deserves special praise From the catchy radio tunes to the atmospheric ambient scores the music in GTA V perfectly complements the gameplay and helps create an immersive experience

In terms of graphics Grand Theft Auto V is a visual marvel The attention to detail is astonishing with stunning landscapes realistic character models and breathtaking weather effects The games ability to maintain a high level of visual fidelity while delivering a vast open world is a testament to the technical prowess of the developers

Grand Theft Auto V is not without its controversies as its mature themes and depiction of violence may not be suitable for all players However it remains a landmark achievement in the world of gaming pushing boundaries and setting new standards for openworld experiences"
Lllllllove this game had it on ps4 and had to buy it on pc i am a big fan of the gta series i mainly play fivem because for some reason my screen goes black when i load base game or ragemp
k
amazing
"Rating 55 

Holy guacamole folks GTA 5 is an absolute blast and a crime wave of epic proportions Ive never had so much fun breaking the law without facing the consequences in a video game of course

From the moment I fired up the game I was thrown into a massive sandbox of mischief complete with a gazillion opportunities to wreak havoc on the unsuspecting citizens of Los Santos Seriously its like the city has an unlimited supply of stolen vehicles and Im the Robin Hood of joyriding

The storyline is wilder than a rodeo on caffeine I found myself rooting for the three protagonists Michael Trevor and Franklin even though theyre as nutty as a fruitcake The banter between them had me laughing harder than a hyena on laughing gas These guys know how to deliver some seriously hilarious dialogue while blowing stuff up

Speaking of blowing stuff up the sheer amount of chaos you can unleash in this game is mindblowing Need a break from stealing cars How about skydiving off Mount Chiliad and crashing into a swimming pool Or maybe youre in the mood to rampage through the city with a rocket launcher turning everything into a fiery mess The possibilities are as endless as my cackling laughter while causing mayhem

And lets not forget about GTA Online where the real party is at Its like a neverending carnival of insanity with players from all over the world teaming up to pull off heists race cars or simply engage in a friendly brawl on the streets Trust me the chaos multiplier increases exponentially when you add other players into the mix Its like a symphony of virtual pandemonium

Visually GTA 5 is a stunner The graphics are so jawdroppingly gorgeous that I found myself stopping midcrime spree just to admire the sunsets the stunning cityscapes and the mesmerizing details Its like stepping into a virtual postcard if that postcard also happened to include explosions and a guy in a chicken suit robbing a convenience store

All in all GTA 5 is an absolute gem of a game Its like a neverending comedy show with explosions car chases and a whole lot of laughs If youre in the mood for some hilarious overthetop action buckle up and dive into the chaos Just remember its all in good fun folks Leave the reallife crime to the fictional pixels

Disclaimer No virtual citizens were harmed during my gameplay sessions Well maybe a few hundred but whos counting Its all part of the fun right"
This is the best game i played on pc I Really Love This Game
woman in swim suit 
kb
Its Great story for a game thats 10 years old
Great way to pass the time
The missions fighting and open world is great But the story is one of the most perfect things I have ever seen I never thought it would be so flipping GOOD Oh and the multiplayer is cool too I guess

"This game sucks online is constantly patrolled by griefers driving opressor mark twos and deluxos Rockstar released new content but only for the latest consoles no pc and on top of that deleted almost 200 CARS FROM THE IN GAME WEBSITE Online without a private server is infuriating because you cant go 10 feet without getting blown up After you beat story mode there is barely anything to do because Rockstar made it so tons of businesses missions and vehicles are only in online The only way to get these in story mode is installing mods Even mods have their problems though They are a lot harder to install then regular mods because GTA 5 doesnt have a steam workshop SO EVERY TIME YOU ADD A MOD IT CORRUPTS THE ENTIRE GAME but then it also starts CRASHING Regular GTA 5 crashed once every hour for me I got some mods and then it starts crashing ONCE EVERY 5 MINUTES It is basically unplayable considering it takes 10 MINUTES TO LOAD BACK IN The only way I could fix the crashing is to UPGRADE MY RAM TO 32 GIGS TO MAKE A GAME PLAYABLE This game is garbage and you have two options to play the game after you beat the mediocre story play online and grind for hours only to get blown up by opressor mark twos or spend hours manually installing mods only to have the game corrupt and for your hours of hard work to be deleted I absolutely fucking hate this game its shitty online and the lack of a steam workshop

Update  It got even worse now I cant even play story mode I tried it without  mods and with mods and both of them gave me this activation error Ive reinstalled the game multiple times but nothing works spending hard earned money for a game that doesnt work is crazy"

"How do you summarise the game that literally defined gaming for the last decade
GTAV Broke ground in every area of gaming and is more than just entertainment its art
from the almost life like at times graphics to the crazy NPCs Grand Theft Auto is so unique because it lets people become someone else fro a moment and do something that they wouldnt do in real life Its a cathartic experience

PLAY THIS F GAME"

"the story is pretty good but with the wait times ive had for the online aspect of the game i could have fully beaten portal 12 atleast once

overall game is pretty neat if you can be patient for the multiplayer part"
GTA V is probably my favorite game the story is well previouse gtas had boring missions and then a couple interesting ones here and there and it makes the story more memorable but gta 5 is sort of like every mission could be one of those interesting missions in gta 4 persay but its still my favorite game 100 reccomend to anybody who is mature enough
game good
The Npcs are overtuned The Rewards are minimal and the desire to put a hole in your monitor grows rapidly Play at your own peril
i like the story

amazing game even better with rp
i fucking wanna kms with these opressors and modders but  other than that game is awesome
I cant even count how many times Ive purchased this game or on how many consoles I have played it on at this point GTA V is one of my favorite game stories of all time and online still continues to impress me with new innovations and additions still presently being introduced with fun well imagined stories and adventures Nothing compares to the jellylike driving in this game GTA V Online is not for the faint of heart and has become a much more expansive place then when I began playing online shortly after game release There has always been an issue with moddershackerstrolls online and despite some friendly players every now and then the amount of trolling and disrespectful gamers can make the game well lets not throw a controller Like I said this game is not for the faint of heart but if you can hang you are going to have a great trip I look forward to GTA VI
play this game

"Great game overall 
Great story mode to play and have before the arival of GTA VI"
I will never get back the 500 hours I have currently put into this game Every time I open the game im immediately reminded of how much of a failure I am in life and how little my efforts mean in the grand scheme of things You would think that a million dollars would get you some pretty cool stuff but in gta its gets you a small bag of potato chips and an 8 oz can of coke This game truly makes me feel small and unappreciated Thank you rockstar

I am an old player I have an account where I grinded countless hours Not only does my account not transfer but I was banned on my new account after only one month of playing this game I got 221 hours in this game total  I was banned because I got tired of the countless times I was killed often by players with a mod menu I downloaded a mod menu not to hurt people but to protect myself People were booting me from sessions locking me in boxes shooting fireworks out of their you know what among many other things I spent a hundred dollars on this game and instead of getting a warning or anything like that I was straight suspended for 2 months I played this game before and I even put money into it even though my friends said it was a waste You guys have a cash cow a money pit and you have a fraudulent way to run your servers I get not wanting modders and stuff but I didnt hurt anyone I get taking the stuff away and a ban for a day or two but no no warning no nothing Like I said I put 100 into this game and now I cant even get online Not that I want to join the toxic free roam where players have all the cool shit and I cant access my account on PC My account is on Xbox but Im switching to PC Does Rockstar understand No Do they care No Ill tell you what Im never playing your stupid game again and I wont be buying GTA6 if you ever come out with that and Im going to let everyone I know to never play it or get the new one either I hope your corrupt company goes out of business and Ill be sure to report your business for your fraudulent play You guys do this all the time Ive seen it on Xbox and its no way to run a business You cant control the hackers so you make everyone scared and then unsuspecting players like me are stuck after spending our hard earned money with a ban for protecting ourselves from the hackers you cant control Your company is a joke and I hope people wake up to the garbage this game is Dont think youre going to get away with my hundred bucks either
i like killing ppl with my tank
Definitely one of the greater games Ive played Most fun with friends though

GTA 5 is an exceptional game that delivers an immersive world captivating storyline and thrilling gameplay Its attention to detail engaging mechanics and vibrant multiplayer make it a true gem in the gaming industry
Genuinely dont get how people play GTA Online with each other the multiplayer aspect of it is so broken and barely functional
good i love this game
the campaign is super fun to play but online is ether grind and waist your life while getting killed by hackers or spend tons of you real life money for barely any money in game
nise game
diamond casino heist setup is atrocious ONLINE
its alrigth
I think that gta is a very fun game since 2013 all the way to now I know that many might not be a big fan because they have wanted gta 6 but in my eyes I think people want to hate because  the way people u mk2s and jets to do everything they can to effect them look at it a different way be different and see it through the bad people

Fantastic single player experience but what keeps this going for years is mainly GTA online at least until GTA6 is released While GTA online does suffer from cheatersmoddersspam etc its not as bad as it used to be in the past as devs are making efforts to suppressban them"

I just bought this game and I regret not getting it earlier GTA 5 is a masterpiece and a wild amazing ride 8 years after release and it feels like a well crafted modern game Do yourself a favor and play it  Happy Heisting
"The game was awesome at first but how they just kept rolling in bullshit for multiplayer and nothing at all into singleplayer past 2015 is a travesty We were promised a singleplayer DLC way back in 2013 and nothing came to fruition

The story was really meh but the missions themselves were fun Having 70ish missions for a story with 3 protagonists aint shit"

"Rating  45

Oh boy where do I even begin with Grand Theft Auto GTA This game is like a rollercoaster ride on steroids with a side of extra cheese If youre looking for a gaming experience that is absolutely bonkers then strap in and get ready for a wild and wacky adventure

First things first the openworld in GTA is mindblowing Youve got an entire city at your fingertips just waiting to be explored and wreak havoc upon Whether you want to take a leisurely drive through the streets jump off a skyscraper or cause chaos with rocket launchers and tanks the possibilities are endless And hey if you ever get tired of the main storyline you can always hop on a bicycle and chase down some unsuspecting pedestrians for a good laugh

Lets talk about the characters shall we Rockstar Games has a knack for creating some of the most memorable and downright outrageous characters in gaming history From the eccentric Trevor with his unpredictable behavior to the suave and smoothtalking Michael youll find yourself laughing at their antics and wondering how on earth they manage to stay alive with all the shenanigans they get into

One of the best things about GTA is the humor The game doesnt take itself too seriously and thats what makes it so entertaining Youll encounter radio stations with hilarious talk shows outrageous commercials and even the occasional celebrity cameo The satire and social commentary sprinkled throughout the game will have you chuckling and shaking your head in equal measure

Now lets address the elephant in the room the mayhem GTA is all about embracing your inner chaos agent You can steal cars rob banks cause massive explosions and go on rampages that would make Godzilla proud Just remember its all in the name of good silly fun I mean where else can you fly a helicopter while dressed as a chicken shooting rockets at your enemies Only in GTA my friend

In terms of technical aspects GTA on Steam runs like a welloiled machine The graphics are topnotch the controls are smooth and the attention to detail is impressive The developers have put in a lot of effort to create a living breathing world that feels alive and vibrant

However I have to deduct one star because lets face it GTA isnt exactly known for its realism Sometimes the missions can get a bit repetitive and the AI can be a little wonky But hey who needs realism when you can hijack a fighter jet and do loopdeloops in the sky

All in all if youre looking for a game that will make you laugh gasp and question your sanity then Grand Theft Auto on Steam is the perfect choice Its a wild and wacky adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end Just be prepared to embrace the madness and leave your serious pants at the door Enjoy the chaos my fellow gamers"
Super fun and easy to play

"very child friendly game highly recommend for kids under 12 years old
it teaches children how to live 
it has good rolemodels in the game
very nice community
shows children how to make money
it teaches children how to strappen your seatbelts
you can bring your child to a shoe store with baddies in it
it also teaches them how to commit mass felonies in the game
it encourages murdering

1010 would make my child play again"

Lag sometimes and just quit the online session even when the connection is stable and working fine
waste of money social club stops me from even playing the game redeem code from steam is already taken cant get a refund because its a consumable product support services ggoes in fucking circles fuck soical club and fuck rockstar never buying anything rockstar again
i shot a hooker
W when modded
WAY too many hackers Like every single server online is FILLED with hackers Also has major connections issues And GTA 5 pushing shark cards on people by limiting the amount of money you make ingame relative to how much things cost is unethical and messed up Rockstar is garbage these days Comment if you have experienced hackers and believe Rockstar will never do anything about it

Recent update has removed around 180 cars from the shop and the only way to access them is by buying a 599 a month subscription And the ONLY way to get this subscription is by playing on Playstation or XboxMicrosoft if you own it on Steam it is impossible to buy Dont worry though the subscription gives you just 500000 A MONTH Game is complete shit now if youre gonna buy it get it on console
"Come on Youre going to get the game and VI when it comes out
Rockstar support actually responds to lost in game items
Hackers really suck
There are lots of glitches online when operating menus
Did I mention how hackers make the game unplayable at times
You should buy this game"

This game is very fun but the new update kinda ruined it for me they locked away a lot of cars behind paywalls that are now xbox exclusive and show no sign of a way to still get them i can live with the servers crashing failing to load in the broken ai ruining heists and the constant moddersspammers but cmon rock star give us back the cars there was no indication or reason why yall made this decision and its a bad one even going as far as people saying that this is one of the few updates we would be way better without

After spending an incredible 1437 hours in the world of GTA V I can confidently say that it is a game that transcends the medium Its a testament to Rockstars unparalleled craftsmanship meticulous attention to detail and commitment to creating a living breathing virtual world Whether youre a fan of openworld exploration captivating storytelling or exhilarating action GTA V delivers on all fronts Its a mustplay for any gamer seeking an unforgettable and endlessly entertaining experience

If you want to get this to play the single player mode its worth it If you want to play online DO NOT PURCHASE Lobbies are FULL of hackers Instead of fixing this issue rockstar decided to enable people to play GTA ONLINE ALONE IN AN INVITE ONLY SESSION You are forced to play this online multiplayer game alone in a private lobby unless you want to constantly get griefed by people flying through the air in vehicles that will blow you up in one shot This game used to be fun but now every aspect of the game has been finely tuned by rockstar to entice you into spending real money on shark cards They removed content from pc players and then put it behind a pay wall THAT WE DONT EVEN HAVE ACCESS TO PC is not anywhere near the front of their minds as they get ready to put out GTA 6 its been a year and a half since they added awesome new cars that go 3060 mph faster than any car on pc and yet we still arent allowed to use any of them we all hoped that after a year they would release it to the pc crowd but instead of giving us these faster cars THEY TOOK NEARLY 200 CARS AWAY FROM US all new content is just reused assets from single player missions they constantly reduce the earning potential from businesses unless one is part of a double money event and even then those businesses are not as good at making you money as the cayo perico heist which they put a massive cooldown on overall it can be a fun game and i loved it really loved it but the blatant lack of care for the pc community is downright infuriating week after week month after month of being forgotten not worth it on PC  unless youre going to hackmod in the online in which case congratulations you are now part of the problem the only way to have fun on this game is to either try to have fun grinding boring repetitive missions over and over again just to purchase an overpriced underperforming car any car that was reasonably priced for its performance was REMOVED FROM THE DAMN GAME  pathetic support for an extremely large community again i used to love this game but it feels like having a girlfriend who goes out every weekend and cheats on you and then comes home expecting you to take her out on a date dont let rockstar cck you if you want to play it that badly just wait for gta 6 or be prepared to be bitterly disappointed after a few hours once you realize how long itll take to get something that doesnt really enhance the gameplay experience Or just do what rockstar really wants you to do not enjoy the game but spend more money on it in the hopes that you might actually eventually enjoy it
so many hackers

"This is the most important review I have ever written  Please read and listen close

YES this is a game
YES I understand this is roleplay
YES I know most normal people will not be affected by this in their real life
but unstable people are not and love this

tell you about me  I work for the police RL  I was very late to try this game bc I thought it was misguided thought it was not  a good influence

finally I think maybe it would be fun so I bought it

opening scene
I had to kill about 20 cops
just to take money from a bank
they had families
sons and daughters
wives
they are trying to keep you safe

money that does not belong to them
I feel the adrenaline rush
it is seductive
but you ruin families children left without a father and wives without a husband
to be honest I started to feel the rush
wanted to kill just to get out 
THAT IS THE END OF CIVILIZATION
I truly believe
as a gamer
THIS game makes killers in real life
make people want to murder their schoolmates

this game is trash and ruins our lives 

back in the days of DOOM many journalists argued that violence is supported by video games
I thought it was nonsense
I play video games too  but always against an evil force
something trying to destroy humanity

THIS game trys to destroy humanity
and I think it is working
look at all the deaths IRL in America random shootings

As I played I got angry at cops for stopping me and that is horrible
this BREEDS discontent and desire to steal money
save our future
dont love this game

please do not appreciate this game"
its an OG game and everyone should experience the masterpiece
all of it
"A Game that I would happily purchase on every platform available and spend time with my friends to always kill some time

It has always received constant updates with regards to graphics game modes vehicles events missions customisation apartments activities and more

I will briefly say that the main story line is an experience one must play more than once it is unforgettable and actionpacked with a lot of exciting moments and many interesting ways to play around the world and how itll be affected

But the main focus is the multiplayer it is without a doubt a true experience that MUST be enjoyed with friends as it brings about the true possibilities this game can provide which consist of Heists Death matches Races Casinos Water Activities Illegal Business Hitmen and more

There will always be a memorable moment for everyone from struggling to perfect a Heist without any deaths to the joys of travelling in Custom Sport Cars whilst listening to the Radio which constantly get updated and play a mix of classic songs and modern rap whenever you choose

910  I wish I have a chance to experience the game for the first time again"

"The game as a whole is awesome whether youre a solo player or youve a group of friends I mean its GTA
The only thing that I had about is this game are some of the bugs  glitches Like if you get in a heist or a job with your friends Once its over You would either be staring into a black or white screen forever and sometimes it works but when it does It sends you and your friends to different closed sessions Theyve a quick join feature in your ingame phone which allows you to get into different sort of jobs quicker Howver in various modes it doesnt work like the cayo perico heist doomsday heist diamond casino heist etc you might get into the lobby sometimes but after that it automatically kicks you or ends the job Now there are various other problems but these ones are the ones that many people go through and the major ones Minor ones are like sometimes if some ends a job while youre in the lobby You teleport under the building or in the  apartment with no way to get out so youve to kys in order to get out but these minor problems doesnt matter at all
PLEASE try to fix the major ones
Update Nowadays even if you get into a heist when someone invites to it doesnt work Great Job R"

best game
Create in the multiplayer online the Create level UI is glitchy and defectivethe multiplayer gameplay sucks alot of the time the storyline in single player is boring as hell and the other players are either too good Cheating or useing hack mods or a waste of time to interact with theres no mic connection that seams to work maybe its just my setup I just dont think the open world design is entertaining enough and I cant use VR in the multiplayer because of anticheat 
love it

It really simulates LA very well and has a great story

very nice game play and excellent story
Hope you like sitting in insanely long ad filled loading screens and having your game constantly crash because thats what youre gonna get if you buy this game Does not matter what specs your PC has or how fast your internet is the game itself is the problem Do not buy under any circumstances get a game that actually works more than 50 of the time
i luv it
fun
its good
lit
uhkhkjghj
its alright
This game is excellent so I thought about completely switching from epic to steam because of the Sales and variety of games I had this on epic and I loved it so much that I also bought it on Steam
This game is literally worth it as just a driving simulator it wouldnt need any more content
granding my theft auto all over the 5 places
A decent game for LSPDFR which is basically a modded version of GTA 5 for becoming a cop
idk but its good
This game made me kms i love it
To go around as your own person feels powerful its fun Theres so many things to choose from even if some of the driving is really bad in a weird way Like I keep hitting and then I fly up in the air Theres even boats though and you can swim even that is weird also The characters are all kinda ugly Sometime a girl wanna pretty thang But you can even play with other characters who you know you can play with your friends who can make their own characters as well If it isnt tooooo expensive like when I got it relatively speaking then sure I dont think itll be so bad to give old screecher a whirl And what I mean is that this whole game is 100 GB Its so expensive to the storage space And even because is computer is not soooooooo good it kind of acts slow really if Im honest I would love to go inside more the buildings though If that can happen in the next version of the game I would be grateful Otherwise save for the ugly slow and stupid qualities this game clings to Im truthfully having a blast Well see what else I can figure out too and how many hijinx I will sneak around to act
If you havent tried it yet simply make the purchase when its on sale as its a bit too old for full price 2013  2023 But still one of the best titles on steam definitely a good ALLTIMECLASSIC

"GTA Online 110 is a disaster filled with 12 year olds griefing 247 Not to mention here is something very hilarious about GTA V Online You pay a game where legally you have the right to play as you paid for a product Rockstar does nothing to Modders that can now crash your game at anytime even in singleplayer This is really game breaking DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GARBAGE Until Rockstar fixes this

Campaign story 1010"
This is a fun game even more fun with friends
made me cream
Its a good game But the infinity loading screen bug needs to be fixed It is happening in Online Mode
Great story The gta online server are mid and overall 8710

Aside from the fact that Rockstar games is too cheap to hire active admins or at least make it to where everyone isnt scripting this game can be a lot of fun
Fun

"I would not recommend the game as is due to the sheer amount of bugs Ive been experiencing as of late makes doing missions heists and even basic prep work a pain Not to mention most lobbies have multiple moders in them and can be a real pain in the neck Rockstar needs to add more maintenance to these servers to prevent bugs and to cut down on the moders but they wont because theyre cheap as hell 

Only get the game if its on sale and wouldnt recommend trying public lobbies not much fun to be had"

Pay to win Boring Grindy Pathetic The fact that the game is not only not free but also has a membership is unhinged This game has nothing going for it It is also filled with modders but wont let me play the game bc I changed a file so I could play all activities in a private session Its actually disgusting that the game forces you to play certain activities in public lobbies That will just result in flying motorcycles bombing you and stealing your shipment Through uninstalling and reinstalling the game it still says Im doing a modified version of the game

its a perfect game with absolutely 0 flaws nothing wrong w the game and should be rated E for everyone for the amount of wonderful happy people in game and the perfect kid friendly but not to kid friendly gameplay
I am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories

Do not buy this game get the og versions of the old games or dont play gta at all The amount of hackers and bugs in the game are insane for how long this game has been out and for how much money is up rockstars ass Your IP is also connected to your rockstar ID so if a hacker gets ahold of that then ggs Dont waste your time on playing this game and I swear if I find out you buy shark cards I will find your rockstar ID and Boot you offline so I save you from playing a shitty ass fucking game

So this fun gta game is great you can even download fiveM and do some realistic online game plays through your GTA v game and in the game its self they have system set up where people who cause chaos get stuck in server after a while with others who cause much chaos too BUNCH of bonuses through out the past 2 years from BIG event and fun ones one time they had ecola vs spunk I TRIED MY BEST TO MAKE SPUNK SODA WIN but more cokecol i mean ecola fans out there 3 UMM the game it self also add community maps at times for there 3X events 247 there will be a 2X or 3X event missions you can find on menu of gamedriving is cool cause after a while you can remember which cars drive better on different terrains realistic IDK cars sorry but i know more about GTA cars than real life cars cause of this game lol looking to make quick cash on game all you gotta do is wait for them 3X events and play them alot and boom easy 34 million in one day from that WAs able to buy krieger for first car in game and it cost 35 million in game due to the 3X events tons of outfit options and seems like they gonna keep adding stuff till GTA 6 I HOPE they keep the X events and community maps adding for events to game after they make GTA 6 but if they dont i hope they make GTA 6 just as fun as GTA 5 good multiplayer coop and vs and epic story THANKS ROCKSTAR STAY AWESOME I AM GLAD WE HAD THE CHANCE TO PLAY THESE CRAZY GRAND THRIFT AUTO GAMES IN OUR LIFE FUN TIMES

Fun game if you dont already own it though I do not know if I would bother
Rockstar is not what it once was The real game you play is trying to install activate and start the game and then combat RockStars stupid error codes and messages Your mission is to convince them you purchased the game  a mission which will be reassigned to you every two years
good game needs more wine flavours though
"its good online and ofline game it has cool features as the casino or heist that you can do 
the singel minus is that you cant  play crosplatform"

Dont waste your fucking money on this piece of shit anymore"

"Its hard to recommend a game that puts their content and supposed unused vehicles which are still very popular behind a pay wall Rockstar is just showing their true colours and want to monetize everything Next thing you know they will add loot boxes and micro transactions Oh wait they already did

The only good thing about the game is LSPDFR for others the PvP was okay or so Ive heard but I personally never liked the whole encouraging griefing thing nor the microtransactions nor the encouragement of kids playing a MATURE game when they cant even comprehend common sense They NEED to leave Fortnite alone where it is because true gamers do not like that crap or griefing for no damn reason

Rockstar is shying away from its true fan base that has been there since the beginning to trade it for a quick buck from kids that just want shiny things and ignorant parents that let them get it without checking or just dont care So far just about every major company in the industry is only out to make a quick dollar and not staying true to their core values and it is just sickening DLCs were enough and the only way to stop this is for the gaming community to put our foot down and stop this in its tracks before it gets exponentially worse"
this game is really cool although i spent most of my hours on the online their is so much to do and although you have to grind a little bit to get to all the heists and all the fun stuff it is worth it in the end This game is amazing to play with friends on the online version Overall I love this game
Stop taking our cars assholes
this game leave you relaxed and release anger  plus you can play with friends crosss play
removed a ton of cars like 190ish this game is suposed to be a game about cars 
good game
f
Nope
"Basically
Buy this game when its on sale or get a cheap CD Key
Play this game if like modding games in general or to play something other than cuckstar online like FiveM
Single player modding  FiveM are the ONLY reason to keep playing
DO NOT play this game if still wanted to play GTA Online as hackers run freely
All in all worth your money"

Even after a Decade the game is very enjoyable  the details put into some of the things still blows my mind  GTA online is also very fun for a casual gaming experience for both solo and with friendsWhile content can definitely be more being a decade old game  its still enough  The car designs and newer heists are one of the strongest features

"h1GTA V STEAM EDITIONh1

This review is from someone whos never played GTA before so just so you know
Ngl the gameplay is great and the whole way the game and story is structured is really good Story is great and in general a great game Cars are ripoffs from real ones Karin Calico  Toyota Celica 1990s etc but theyre still epic You can do a lot in terms of customisation of cars in both Story Mode and Online One main problem for me is the hackers on GTA online A while back I crashed into another car in online by accident and this guy comes out throwing whatever at me before I know it Im GTA online level 106 and have found all collectables or whatever theyre called Also the 106GB storage needed is a bit big for a lot of people pretty sure its mainly for the map for nononline play not sure but it is big

Anyway overall its a great game would recommend because its like nothing else really out there Massive map endless game

Its a great game but online is too full of Griefers and modders but if you play in an invite only session you dont have to worry The story mode is so content rich and is overall fun to play
Grand Theft Auto 5 delivers an exhilarating experience with its enjoyable costume customization and a wide variety of cars to choose from allowing players to fully immerse themselves in their chosen roles and missions The games interactive multiplayer aspect adds an extra layer of excitement and engagement While the graphics are visually appealing especially with an upgraded VGA the passage of time has made it evident that newer titles like Red Dead Online have surpassed GTA 5 in terms of visual presentation Nonetheless the games captivating storyline a trademark of Rockstar leaves a lasting impact particularly the memorable decision of choosing which character receives the final shot after spending the entire game with two companions Overall Grand Theft Auto 5 stands as an excellent game but fans eagerly await the arrival of a new installment in the series perhaps in the form of GTA 6
good game but you want team
cool and more cooler

"GTA V  today is classic game And there is nothing new i can say about it  All best
But after 370h gameplay  new instalation i have problem with running game because Rockstar Launcher is blocking running  I bought this title  on steam  now i have error  that  my steam is not linked with rockstar game account   It is kinda frustratring that  launcher is blocking  playing  after 370h of gameplay 
I like all GTA titles in serie  now i wanted to let my kid try to play game  but i cant run game   If i pay game at steam  i want to play and run it trought  steam    This is so frustratring issue  that i will maybe download some pirated copy i dont know what else to do after contacting tech support"

"I have recently had the pleasure of diving into the world of Grand Theft Auto 5 GTA 5 and its online counterpart and I must say it has been an absolutely fantastic experience Rockstar Games has truly created a masterpiece that captivates players with its immersive gameplay stunning visuals and an expansive open world that offers endless opportunities for excitement and exploration

One of the standout features of GTA 5 is its compelling storyline The game introduces us to three unique protagonists each with their own compelling backstories and personalities The writing and voice acting are topnotch drawing players into a gritty and often humorous narrative filled with unexpected twists and turns The character development is superb making it easy to form a strong connection with these virtual personas

The open world of Los Santos is an absolute marvel The attention to detail is astounding from the bustling streets to the towering skyscrapers and lush countryside Whether Im cruising through the city in a flashy sports car or embarking on an adrenalinepumping heist the level of immersion is unparalleled The world feels alive with pedestrians going about their daily lives emergency services responding to incidents and a wide array of activities to engage in such as tennis golf and even skydiving

GTA Online takes the already outstanding singleplayer experience and expands it into a multiplayer realm It provides a vast and dynamic playground for players to team up or compete against each other in a variety of game modes and activities Whether Im participating in adrenalinefueled races engaging in intense heists with friends or simply exploring the open world together the multiplayer aspect adds a whole new dimension of fun and excitement

Rockstar Games has done an excellent job of supporting GTA Online with regular updates and new content ensuring that the experience remains fresh and engaging They consistently introduce new missions vehicles and game modes keeping players hooked and invested in the online world The ability to customize and personalize my character and own luxury properties provides a sense of progression and achievement further enhancing the longterm appeal of the game

Furthermore the community surrounding GTA 5 and Online is incredibly vibrant and diverse Interacting with other players from around the world adds an unpredictable and dynamic element to the gameplay Whether its teaming up for cooperative missions or engaging in heated battles in the competitive modes the multiplayer aspect fosters a sense of camaraderie and friendly competition

In conclusion GTA 5 and its online counterpart provide an unparalleled gaming experience The captivating storyline immersive open world and the dynamic multiplayer component make it a true masterpiece Rockstar Games has created a virtual world that offers endless hours of entertainment and their commitment to ongoing updates and content ensures that players are continually engaged If youre looking for a game that combines thrilling action immersive storytelling and limitless possibilities GTA 5 and GTA Online are an absolute mustplay"

Absolutely unplayable takes as long as rust to load into a session and the online scene is so overwhelmed by hackers that i would say there is a 100 chance they will crash your game Most grievers mod of choice Do not play unless you have mods installed that stop the modders from crashing your game
재미있음

this game is crackfrustratingly doing the same missions over and over again to no gainfilled with bugs and hackerserrors and crashesmoney spent on an unfinished productbut is still addictive becaus no other game comparesyet extremely frustrating
Love That Game
game fucking sucks
the amount of hackers and modders online is insane  yet rock star refuses to do anything about it   too many crashes in between missions to warrant a reccommendation to this toxic pile of sht  steam asked me if i wanted to revise my review and its still shit after 18 hours more play time lol
o
it is very fun but the hangers are confeusing becuase you have to do osmething with simon to unlock them and it is a house hole
This game is good to play in story mode but almost impossible with all the little kids blowing up the whole map in online mode if the devs want people to play i do not understand why they continue to allow this absolute disgrace to continue to happen i get maybe 30 min in online mode before somebody logs in and decides to continually destroy the whole map this is not fun for anybody trying to actually play the game and get anywhere in online mode and i can not see how it is entertaining for the mentally challenged person doing it if i was you i would not buy this game and if you have REFUND it ASAP Rockstar you have changed bro you used to be cool now just a sad existence in a ever evolving world of epic games so to wrap up this game is TRASH
thornton duggan fears me
yes
I would if you just wanted to play the story mode but if you want to play online good luck doing anything without modders fucking up 510 minutes into any session you get into Just ruins the game completely
itsss realy fun
the best game ever
This game is the best game in the world but is at the same time the worst game in the world Interpretate that as you wish
They took out over 180 cars from GTA online to put behind a paywall in this 12 yearold and already milked to death game Scumbag Rockstar They also stopped bringing over content that consoles get to PC giving us neutered content patches Look it up and avoid the game
I originally liked this game and enjoyed lpaying online however after their move of legacy items to a subscription service i can no longer support this game or company please dont put your time into this game that treats the community like dirt
it doesnt run on Linux  SteamDeck anymore

"Lets make a subscription service for a 10 year old game Put 90 of the cars we have behind the paywall THEN lets make it unavailable to the pc users Cause fuckem
Rockstar is a fucking joke of a company Need their greedy hands chopped off and heads shoved in a garbage disposal Fuck Rockstar Dont give this company a cent of your money Illegally download the game and modhack the shit out of it"

"The driving in the game is therapeutic  One of the best things about GTA V Online is the variety of cars and vehicles you can drive especially the ones that can fly Yes you heard me right there are some cars and bikes that can take off and soar through the air like a bird or a plane Imagine the fun you can have with your friends cruising around the city dodging bullets and missiles and laughing at the poor souls stuck on the ground Here are some of the coolest flying vehicles you can get in GTA V Online

Imponte Deluxo This is a classic sports car that looks like it came straight out of a scifi movie It has gullwing doors a sleek design and a hidden feature it can fly At the click of a button you can switch between car mode and hoverfly mode and glide over any obstacle in your way You can also equip it with weapons such as a machine gun and homing missiles making it a deadly aerial threat The Deluxo can be purchased from Warstock Cache  Carry for 57500001
Pegassi Oppressor This is a motorcycle that has wings and a rocket boost It can jump and glide for a limited amount of time or use the boost to fly faster and higher It can also be fitted with weapons such as a machine gun and homing missiles making it a versatile vehicle for both land and air combat The Oppressor can be purchased from Warstock Cache  Carry for 27500001
Pegassi Oppressor Mk II This is an upgraded version of the Oppressor that replaces the wheels with the ability to hover and fly Its faster more agile and more stable than its predecessor and can also be fitted with weapons such as homing missiles and countermeasures The Oppressor Mk II can be purchased from Warstock Cache  Carry for 80000001
Mammoth Thruster Jetpack This is a jetpack that lets you fly like a superhero It has two thrusters on the sides that propel you forward and upward and two smaller ones on the back that help you steer It can also be fitted with weapons such as homing missiles making it a fun and powerful gadget to use The Thruster Jetpack can be purchased from Warstock Cache  Carry for 25000001

These are just some of the flying vehicles you can get in GTA V Online There are also planes helicopters blimps and more that you can use to explore the sky You can also do various activities with your friends in GTA V Online such as races deathmatches heists missions freemode events business battles drug wars2 and more GTA V Online is a game that never gets boring because theres always something new and exciting to do with your friends"

these dirt bags done went an got rid of most of the cars you can buy online that weve had for 10 years and made GTA which is 5 a month to get the cars back that we had for 10 years Best part is you cant get GTA on PC Rockstar youre petty asf for that and you know it GTA 6 is literally going to be just micro transactions for everything

"Lost access to my Rockstar social club account so now I cant even play singleplayer  whats the point in purchasing games anymore when you can just have your ability to play them taken away by a 3rd party

"After all these years and all the time Ive played I finally have enough money to buy an apartment and a car Just kidding I havent touched online since 2016

Used to mod singleplayer until Rockstar kept pushing out pointless updates that would break everything to do with the SP modding scene since then I havent touched the game and that was October 2022

Now Im down the middle with this game I do recommend it for the singleplayer experience and the top shelf story telling by R but can not recommend it for the online side too much greed with the shark cards too many cheaters and hackers from what Ive heard and just general BS from T2R about things through the years"
strip club had me busting em out for hours
add sex gamemode and shoe store very good 11
VERY GUD

WAY TOO BUGGY FOR A GAME THATS BEEN HERE FOR 10 YEARS

"Steam says I have 352 hours on GTAVGTAO Considering I ported my character over from Xbox 360 it should be at least double that


So lets say 112 hours

I have spent aproximately 112 hours playing this video game

Yet I cannot recommend it

Yes I have had some of the best gaming Ive ever had with this game I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign I played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside I even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card I was there for the DNS glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur and I was there when they cut literally everyones funds to 500000 as a fix

But one day I was playing and some guy joins the server forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him freezes us and makes bags of money rain from the sky

Dont get me wrong Im not stupid I know people hack and people give out money Ive seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc Ive generally ignored them but this guy didnt give me much of a choice

Regardless once I figured out what was happening I left the server I didnt want the money in my bank so I blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up

A couple hours later I was temporarily banned and my character was reset I lost all of my cars including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched not to mention the majority of that 112 hours Id put into having a character I liked

Rockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me My ingame wallet was raped and they decided to blame the victim

There was no way for me to voice my displeasure to Rockstar No appeals process for them to hear my case check the evidence and see my innocence

That was several months ago I uninstalled the game and let it go

Im only writing this now so that others can see what theyre getting into

Yes as Ive said this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content From an objective standpoint its very good value for money and the free regular DLC is a nice touch

What ruins all of that is the way Rockstar treats its customers Theres no consistency and no compassion I know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and theyve never had any trouble Yet it happens to me once without my consent and I get temp banned and lose literally everything

What motivation is there to play legitimately then If people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision and those who dont can get away with it indefinitely

Hell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience

Rockstar if you actually end up reading this please start treating your customers with some compassion Dont assume were all hackers"

This game is about as fun as sticking my balls in a waffle iron cause when youre not dealing with griefers on their flying bike you have to deal with modders that constantly blow you up or crash your game but the moment that you use a menu for protection purposes Rockstar decides to screw you over and start you from scratch instead of dealing with the other much like a parent picking the golden child who broke something and blames it on you who did nothing

Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best thrilling openworld actionadventure game that Ive played till date It combines a gripping narrative with immersive gameplay Set in the fictional city of Los Santos it follows three protagonistsMichael Franklin and Trevoreach with a unique story The game excels in its realistic graphics diverse missions and an expansive openworld environment With engaging heists dynamic characters and a plethora of activities GTA V offers an unparalleled gaming experience Whether cruising through the city participating in highstakes robberies or exploring the vast landscape the game captivates players with its depth and attention to detail A modern classic that continues to captivate audiences till date despite being released such a long time ago
"The campaign is fantastic and immersive so go play it if you havent However

There are too many modders in GTA Online I encounter at least one each session They have the powers to completely break your online experience If you do anything to annoy them perhaps accidentally they have the power to remove you from the session For a company like Rockstar this is unacceptable"
really good game ngl

Ive beaten this game on the 360 xbox and most of the way on PC I love GTA as a series and this may be one of my favorite games of all time However this port to PC just doesnt feel solid  and if you have any desire to play GTA online then prepare to be met with a barrage of hackers and the potential to have your account falsely banned

God some of the fucking nostalgia I get when I play this game I originally owned it on PS4 but recently bought it on PC Driving through the city of Los Santos while running people over going 120 MPH nothing will ever beat it Jokes aside though this game has made some of the most memorable and greatest characters in gaming history
W GAME SO MANY HOT GIRLS IN BIKINIS AT STRIP CLUB  AND LAP DANCE ON TOP

You only ban players who glitch money but not those who mod the game online you are a disappointment  rockstar I loved the previous gta games but now you are just some greedy old developers who dont givr shit about their fanbase
your mom
e
Was good but highly unplayable nowadaysThe amount of cheaters is deplorable at best Along with the amount of times you cant load into lobbies or you just randomly crash the game is barely a fraction of what it was
i luv it
I love GTA there are endless things to do and things to buy
race car
very good game I personally love it
yes
I like the kid that smokes weed and jerks off lol
They removed 200 cars for PC and now you have to pay for Xbox  to get access to a show room to actually randomly buy them And guess what They are in ridiculous prices I hate to say it but the devs are now just about as bad as every phoney company the game tries to portray You want a car game This aint it chief
m
good game
i just fucking got suspended from gta 5 online for no reason and my gta characters will be reset which i have played with for hour and hours to level up
Its fun and addicting but its hard to figure what you are supposed to do im also trying to figure out how to make sure my voice chat is on so wish that was a bit easier  but all and all a pretty good game would recommend spending the 15 bucks
Really fun game Would recommend for people who like realistic shooter and criminal games

this game is just the best
I am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
Nice Game

"I did not enjoy Grand Theft Auto V

Played for 45 hours reached 25 completion For me this was simply hard work

The graphics quality is amazing if compared with GTA SanAndreas The depth of all the crazy characters and the scope of the map is epic Seems good so far

But the gameplay in each mission is mundane silly shooting or driving or pointing things at other things
And the complexity of the controls  I am using an Xbox360 controller with the game running on a Windows PC  are completely confusing overwhelming and the functions of buttons and sticks keeps changing in bizarre ways when you move from being on foot to driving to flying and all sorts of other special activities

In summary I dont think this is really a game It is more like watching a mashup of Adventure Films TV soap operas Soft Porn Reality TV programs and Art movies  but instead of simply watching the films theplayer is constantly being told to press some buttons and tilt some joystics in a rather moronic fashion

I found it very difficult to find the right buttons or joysticks or Dpad controls in each situation and to read the instructions popping up on screen and then vanishing and to control the gun  camera  car  etc with the required accuracy and speed And all for what purpose Just so the plot of the GTA V film that is called Story Mode in GTA V can proceed No thankyou

There are so many controls and so many overlapping control actions that some of the actions involve holding certain buttons whilst pressing other buttons in a strictly timed sequence If you do the button convolutions wrong in sequence or in timing then it just does something different  not what is needed Near impossible for me to sort all that out when in the heat of battle against opposing ground and air forces  and needing to switch between three different player characters  all in the same helicopter

Go to Ammunation gun ranges to practise shooting No good The shooting controls are different when in the gun range from those in the real world I could not pass the first round of anything in the gun ranges

The only playercontrolled activity that I enjoyed in this game was to take a crosscountry motorbike ride out over the hills to the coast and take a swim in the ocean For that activity there are simple controls great graphics and all at the players own choice and control But that activity is nothing to do with the missions of the game

After playing for three weeks I uninstalled the game I am glad I saw the graphics on a 2K PC monitor Apart from that one pleasure I regard the experience as a waste of my money and a waste of my time"
This is goodwhen you cheat

i have never had a better experience than this game

"Oh boy where do I even begin with GTA V Its like strapping yourself into a rocketpowered roller coaster that takes you on a thrill ride you never wanted to end Heres my hilariously chaotic review of this insane game

First off lets talk about the story Its like a crazy mashup of a Hollywood blockbuster a soap opera and a fever dream Youve got three protagonists Michael the retired bank robber who cant resist one last score Franklin the streetsmart hustler with dreams of making it big and Trevor the absolute madman whos so unpredictable youll question your own sanity just by being in the same virtual universe as him These characters are so outlandishly entertaining that youll find yourself cheering for the bad guys and laughing maniacally at their ridiculous anticsThe world of Los Santos is a sprawling playground of mayhem and debauchery Want to go skydiving Sure why not Feel like taking a leisurely drive through the city Good luck avoiding the inevitable car crash or pedestrian pileup because lets be honest following traffic rules is for boring people And dont even get me started on the police chases Nothing beats stealing a cop car causing utter chaos and then escaping by the skin of your teeth all while laughing manically at the sheer absurdity of it all"

"As an open action adventure game in a virtual world GTA 5 is undoubtedly a very good game  It offers a huge game world with a rich variety of missions and activities full of excitement and challenges

 First of all the game screen of GTA 5 is very exquisite and the details are handled very well  Whether it is city buildings vehicle models or character movements it all gives people a realistic feeling  At the same time the sound effects and soundtrack of the game are also very good which can enhance the atmosphere and immersion of the game

 Secondly the plot of GTA 5 is very exciting full of suspense excitement and surprises  Players can play different roles and experience different story lines which makes the game more attractive and deep

 In addition GTA 5 also provides a variety of game content and activities  Players can freely explore the game world drive various vehicles participate in various tasks and challenges and can also play online multiplayer games with other players  These diverse ways of playing make the game more fun"

The story mode is a blast With online unless you have friends you have to do heists with randoms and you always get stuck with some idiot that screws up the heist or leaves midway through The updates have been sucking the past year with the most recent one removing more content than it adds Furthermore if you want any of the cool cars the game has to offer you either have to use mods or make grinding the aforementioned heists a second job Buy it on sale for the story mode and maybe have some fun with friends online Also never buy Shark Cards they completely ruined online
Maybe when the yes and then he says no but then he says yes this game is fun and good so maybe you buy it cause that man right there said its a good game you know

Its a good game but i want my money back lol good game tho 100
You could play this game for years and suddenly find that the Launcher stops working because someone managed to link your Steam ID to their social club account without ever compromising either your rockstar account or steam account  Rockstar support is abysmal for helping  Buyer Beware you risk losing everything tied to R if you purchase on PC

very much would recommend one of the best games ever made
five m is one of the only things keeping this game alive its on its deathbed and until gta 6 comes out its not gonna die

although no one talks about the story mode is quite good so is online if you have friends to have fun with The ingame things to buy are insanely expensive to the point where you can not grind your way to them The missions are fun to do with friends tho

"I have owned this game since October of 2015 I have played this game with the same two characters on XBox 360 XBox One and then migrated to PC I have invested well over 3000 hours into this game Needless to say it was for a very long time one of my favorites if not my favorite For over a span of one year it was the only game I played

With the most recent actions of Rockstar by removing vehicles we have not only grinded for but some of us had literally paid for to place them behind a subscription paywall I am uninstalling this game For nearly a decade GTAV has been a staple in my gaming collection No more No longer can I condone what Rockstar has done to its player base No more can I sit idly by and ignore the grift No more will I allow this complete and wholesale abuse by a publisher to continue

No More

Goodbye Rockstar Thnks fr th mmrs"

best game ever only for story mode

On second day of playing online social club acc got hacked
gta 5 is actually the best game ever made its fun has a lot of fun missions and its just to easy to play
it good
online is nice
I remember I delete the game  full of mod panel user online ruining the game  plus unistallit maybe finally they will relase a new title insted to milk this old cow
lots of titties
its fun
it is fun and amazing gameplay but alittle laggy
Nice Game
is gta
I am a 45 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game I am a single father to my Son who is 14 now My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game This was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him I loaded into the game picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well This game reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories
very good

"There are so many bugs you encounter every day that the game leaves you fuming after every session and all these bugs are so very frequent like almost every session you would face multiple of such issues
Some of them are
A lot of times during missions you would get in your car but it wouldnt move
You are trying to enter a getaway vehicle during a mission as passenger and you would get stuck at the car door and not because the owner have not granted permission the door would open but you would not be able to enter
During latest mercenaries update while doing charlie mission you would engage autopilot in your avenger but would not be able to enter the cockpit againThere are so many bugs that listing them here would not make sense go read a subreddit and you would know what Im talking about
It usually takes forever to be able to join a public lobby and out of nowhere you are alone in the session even when upnp is on and the nat settings are at moderate
The money aspect of the is also focused on selling shark cards so most of the time you would spend on grinding for money
I fell in love with GTA when I first played San Andreas but GTA V online is not really the most alluring aspect for me love the story missions though"
haha 69
who doesnt like driving recklessly and killing people with a chance to respawn Jokes Aside gta has an amazing storyline and it has many features that can make the game limitless
yeah ok
I watched Bigfoot climb into a jetpack to then ram into a telephone pole and explode makes up for every black screen and moder in the game
"I like ruining ppls days with a sniper

Ever since GTA as a franchise came out just like the submarine Titan it really blew up
"Rockstar want MORE money they do not care about players
Add more subscription and ur company WILL bankrupt in near future
Save your money Do not support what Rockstar has become
Rockstar do u really want to create GAMES or u became just another sht company that cares about subscriptions and business model"

Give us the same updates as console 
You can make the money that you cant in real life
Very fun to play with friends and enjoyable

"h1 Review 31 h1
b Brief b Important thing I want to note first is that I am giving this a positive review purely for the Story ModeSingleplayer Campaign The storytelling was really great visuals were great combat was randomly good or bad due to how wacky the AI likes to be which can make for some funny moments too though Other than that GTA Online has for me personally lost its value over time but that also could just be that now Ive grown up and the desires to play this game when I was younger have faded away So overall I recommend this game if you are purely interested in the singleplayer part of it

u Positives u
list
     Great singleplayer story Fantastic characters and visuals
     Huge map to explore around
     The driving mechanics feel great as well as well as there are a huge variety of vehicles out there to drivefind
     Achievements though there was also GTA Online achievements so getting them all is a pain mostly

list
u Negatives u
list
     My experiences with the combat in this game have been between good and bad Sometimes the AI works just fine sometimes they can be dumb though this can make funny moments too Especially cop car AI
     Regarding GTA Online Without friends I dont see this being much fun especially considering if you wish to even try doing most of the heists you need 4 people regardless Then to mention random lobbies in GTA Online can have lots of cheatershackers whatever you wanna call them Or just downright annoying people on a flying motorbike with rockets that wont let you put even a toe outside where you live without being eradicated from Los Santos
     Regarding GTA Online Now I have no idea why they thought making enemies bullet sponges when selecting a harder difficulty for 15x reward was a good idea for making it harder Yes it does make it harder by just making it more annoying and less fun to play I cant believe you can shoot some of these enemies in the face multiple times and they just get right back up Unless everyone is the Terminator I dont understand why they absorb bullets
list
i Im not gonna tell you if you should buy it though thats up to you to decide I just provide my positive and negative experiences  wamcrash i"
nice game
"the game play is over all okay it is nothing to be impressed by but if you are looking for something to pass the time GTA 5 is an okay choice
but the story is just meh
the controls and physics are weird
for me this game is a 310"
Great game to experience virtual world play and other personal settings

"GTA V story mode is 1010 
GTA online im personaly having so much fun in the game nice car nice businesses nice story there is a lot of griefer and modder in the game but i dont mind I still enojy it till today"
Removed over 100 cars from the game
When you grind the game a lot you will probably get bored with it and at times its boring to do all the same things all the time just to make money and too many cheaters that destroy other peoples experience but rockstar wont make a solution to get rid of them our best way of getting rid of cheaters is hop in a privatesolo session but sometimes it just doesnt work and the cheaters could still get in and when youve played the game a lot and have a lot of money the game just doesnt seem fun anymore but over all its actually a good game it can be fun its just at times there is something or someone that could destroy that fun
Good game
gud
yee
I love cars

very good
good but lots of hackers
Loved the game since the day it announced and the story goes brrrrrrrrrr
cool
Glad to finally have it on PC
none of the bundle items were on my account soooooo refunded apparently thats a problem with other people too so just get the cheapest version of the game no matter how good the summer sale is  still an amazing game just rating it bad so maybe more people see it and dont waist money on content theyre not gonna get
fun
Red Dead is betterbut still amazing

Theres a lot of fun to be had in the game but the old publisher greed chestnut is rendering it harder and harder Now that they decided to be true to the games name and lock a huge amount of previously free content behind a goddamn subscription I found the pitiful remnants of my selfrespect and decided to quit Dont give these people money Thats how this behaviour is normalised and validated

HDFDH
not a jump scare game
Not that bad
For a game about stealing cars youd think the driving controls might be a little more fluid than riding your rollerblades down an ice rink covered in butter Also the dialogue sounds like it was written by a white guy who was ECSTATIC for his chance to repeatedly write a word that Steam might decide I dont need to be here anymore if Im more clear Im just hitting highlights but in just in general his game aged like milk in the sun I have no idea how theyre monetizing it so heavily in its state
Way better on PC

truly one of the games of all time
Removed alot of cars and put them behind a subscription paywall plus the constant hackers Going to have to not recommend any Rockstar games if this is path they are taking
gun
Great game cant wait for 6
A very fun game you can play it with friends and even make friends sadly my old steam account was hacked and i lost everything but starting over is so much more fun then i remembered it being There are four types of people in this game 1 The mean modder who makes everyones day worse 2 the nice modder who makes people laugh or rich 3 the greiffer do i even need to explain this one 4 the casual player who is either quiet and just doing their own thing or talking making friends and having fun All in all this is a very good game and i suggest getting it

"This is primarily about Online but first

GTA V Singleplayer  Pretty damn good story is great and the characters are all solid If youre just getting it for singleplayer just pretend this review is positive I recommend it a lot

GTA Online Can be fun and isnt all that difficult to make money solo or with friends anymore thank you private lobbies for letting us finally sell business stock but removing 180 vehicles just aint it I would have recommended it before the current update only if you dont mind grinding but now there isnt much to grind for"
yes
The latest update to the multiplayer removed many cars and put them behind a monthly paywall
Hours of fun You can pick multiple variations and play the game differently

Fantastic and iconic game Not much to say about it However I find the Rockstar Games Launcher to incredibly difficult at times taking several tries with the same password to login and having instances where it crashes the game all together Wish you could start the game without the Rockstar games launcher
its a good and fun game come try if you like
i love getting blown up while doing a setup
"









             all i feel
 is pain"
yes
the game lost its charm when they added pointless futuristic overpowered pay to win vehicles like the oppressor MK II and now they are removing content from the game that players already payed for and putting it behind a subscription truly disgusting
Really good game if you can take it as what its meant to be which is satire and very funny too Sure it can be a bit weird and uncomfortable sometimes but that just makes it interesting to see what wacky things happen next in my opinion Also very good small details that I never noticed until this time playing like there is lots of well placed hidden dialogue within phone you can pull up by calling your in game contacts without it being an objective and the different story development in story mode in general is amazingly well written
GTA one of the best games ever made

"bSingle Player Reviewb

Its hard to believe that this game launched a decade ago was built to run on machines with as little as 512 MB of RAM a very optimized title and was most importantly the most successful entertainment product in history surpassing other games movies and music in revenue
With a very engrossing story that expands the concept of multiple protagonists and points of view this blockbuster of a game will make you feel like youre in a truly Hollywoodian story With all the pop culture references all satirizing the American way of life the game utilizes heavy scripting to trick you into thinking the engine is way more powerful than it really is
Talking about mechanics iGTAi is a dichotomy while the car handling is very Arcade the game takes into consideration the number of occupants in the car for handling so this is very much a design choice Unfortunately the top speeds are very limited due to loading and breaking and acceleration are greatly exaggerated All this makes driving for hours in a city grid very relaxing different from the predecessor iGTA IVi which was more like a simulator
While being a car game and a crime simulator makes all sense since you can try out any car you like still owning and keeping collections in singleplayer is pretty flawed
We are talking about a game full of personality that feels alive from the protagonists NPCs cars and even the city You will never see a sunset like others after thousands and thousands of hours of playing This game survived three generations of consoles and almost a decade and made a challenge to Rockstar how can you make a sequence for a title like iGTA Vi

bMultiPlayer Reviewb

GTA multiplayer was not the focus of the developers at Rockstar at the start it was more like a parallel project using the game assets to build another game that would add value to the overall experience With not a lot of activities and glitches the multiplayer start was bumpy back in 2013 but with free DLC after free DLC the game started getting more and more content ranging from new vehicles to new missions iThe Heists updatei introduced a singleplayerquality narrative and story online in 2015 With the addition of being a CEO or Motorcycle gang leader in iFurther Adventures in Finance and Felonyi and iBikersi DLCs in 2016 GTA turned into a full MMOish experience with stock in warehouses and drugs in your factories being built and persisting over time At the same time we started seeing the rise in the price of content go along with methods to make money as a way to incentivize microtransactions with each DLC trying to top the one before In 2017 we reached the peak of megalomania with flying cars and bikes and satellites with orbital laser strikes with The iDoomsday Heisti and since the negative feedback Rockstar has been dialing back on this type of content In 2019 we had a new location iThe Diamond Casino  Resorti featuring later on iThe Diamond Heisti In 2020 Rockstar launched the biggest update with iThe Cayo Perico Heisti featuring topquality content ways of making money and a whole new island In 2021 we had a Fast  Furiousinspired update with iLos Santos Tunersi and a later one featuring Dr Dre and Franklin Clinton from the singleplayer story in iThe Contracti with each update being shaped more and more by community feedback With cars resembling more real ones we see a spike in prices and anticonsumer practices as the PC version of the game still has not received the Next Generation upgrade to boost sales on these consoles

One of the building blocks of one of the most successful roleplaying mods that dominates iTwitchi iGTA Onlinei has been the target of controversy when the developers try to shut down FiveM With the excuse to battle Cheating a battle that had been lost and almost making me give this game a negative review the peertopeer network structure where GTA Online is built and relies on does not give any security against cheating and modding and the game is not built to take security factors into account as well as not having a real anticheat system and some simple scripts that can be bypassed So at any time you can see your progress destroyed and the fact that some people try to push the agenda that cheating in GTA is somewhat acceptable only makes the problem worse

At some point in time isome of these problems have been fixed others have been partialy fixedi cheaters could Set themselves in god mode use aimbots or autoaim in free aim sessions use ESPs and have every information about you teleport themselves anywhere in the map teleport you give you money striketake money from you through the insurance systemstrike freeze you in place stick objects on your character or vehicle spawn explosions on every player in the session strikespawn explosions on players and make look like it was other player that have done it in the kill feed framingstrike strikechange their RSC nick name for players inside a sessionstrike softlock missions modify the damage of any given weapon give you weapons strikeremove your weaponsstrike prevent you from being a CEOBiker leader eject you from your vehicle give bad sport points that at some point send you to a session with other bad sport players remove reports given to them kick you from your session strikeget inside your private sessionstrike strikeleak of your IP and locationstrike strikecorrupt your Online save filestrike strikecontrol de weather sessionwidestrike crash your game and the list goes on"

very good game
perfect
Good
kill the bitches
After having played for over 200 hours of GTAV on PC let alone the countless amount of hours I have also played on PS3 Xbox 360 PS4 Pro and Xbox Series X and S I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that is as close to a real life simulator as you can get as you can do a countless number of different things all throughout los santos from robbing gas stations to buying and selling stocks and other things along with completing tasks and missions I absolutely love this game and I love the fact now that I can run it in 4K at over 140 FPS with a Ryzen 9 5950x and a RTX 4090 Absolutely stunning eye candy It makes the game that much more enjoyable of an experience The fact that it has been on sale a bunch as well makes it that much more of a deal Between this game and Red Dead Redemption 2 these are my two favorite games from Rockstar as of today writing this review for everyone Definitely give this game and Red Dead 2 a chance since both of them are on sale majority of the time and the gameplay is impressive it will not disappoint you especially if you are running a top of the line PC as I am You definitely cannot go wrong with this game I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do
this game has given me more pain than getting kicked in the balls

I like the game but I did a mission and after a mission I couldnt find my Deluxo in any of my garages Insurance didnt have it and it wasnt in the impound lot I searched for 4 hours and I didnt find it until I was going to contact Rockstar Support but that didnt work either because I couldnt login into my Social Club so I said screw it and went to bed Then the next day I woke up and it was in my garage with no upgrades I have Dementia and Schizophrenia

"Ive never seen a gaming company that is so generous and just look on with modders and abusers 
Its a garbage game and a garbage company
I sincerely hope GTA6 and Rockstar are flop"
Its GTA 5 If Steam used a star system tho Id knock it down like 2 stars for the godawful online
Too many modders trying to give you non solicited cash risking your account from being restarted or bannedsuspended

Greatest heist game ever I recommend you to play it

its good
Its GTA V Its a fun game but after Rockstar removed most of the anticheat earlier this year theres waaayy too many cheaters trying to get you banned Worth to buy on sale
To put things very simply The game can be a fun time with friends You can have private lobbies now and grind for cash and still have a ton of content or run from the cops with a friend for the nostalgia However there is no anti cheat and its BAAAAD People can rip your IP kick you out of a lobby teleport trap you explode you etc This has been going on for a couple years now and getting worse and Rockstar has not addressed it despite doing weekly updates and pushing content They recently took over half the vehicles off the in game store that you can by with the in game currency and put them behind a paywall you need to use real world money for Its just not worth it and not worth spending money on for such a crappy experience Between Red Dead 2 getting no love and how theyre going to try to mine us for money in GTA6 Im not going to bother with many Rockstar games from here on out They cant even provide a fair and safe online experience in their most popular game and would rather use it to nickle and dime their audience

Rockstar Games and Steam needs to do a lot more to weed out hackers and ban them for life The game is seriously compromised and the cache on my computer needs to be cleared after hackers go on a rampage harrassing users playing online If banning accounts doesnt work then start banning credit cards or entire regions such as China if need be I get it that hackers will always find some kind of loophole but PLEASE do more to rid the game of them

"Hello Rockstar
I really like what you did in every kind of thing of this game is wonderfull there is just one thing in GTA V online it is nearly impossible to find a Lobby without any cheaters Modders or even Hackers I just got killed once again and spawnkilled by a Cheater the thing is this game is really cheap so the modders dont really care about a ban my opinion is that this game maybe gets a higher price so it hurts if you have to pay more and more for each unecessary ban for like maybe 25
The game is cool but there are still people which are ruining all the fun in the game"

All the love of freedom and lawlessness is just a shell of what it once was the game is toxic and so are the remaining players if you miss that experience from the OG days FiveM is the answer no default story but you can certainly make your own

The Eiffel Tower can be 15 cm taller during the summer due to thermal expansion meaning the iron heats up the particles gain kinetic energy and take up more space so taking into to the polarity of the sun compared to the nearest black hole you get GTA well if you factor in how 2 is nothing on Mars and 1093648 on Uranus you get how good GTA is and I think its in between the temperature of frozen and lukewarm
terrible always crashes and freezes takes ages to load

"This is a legendary game More precisely the last part of the legendary Grand Theft Auto series of games or briefly GTA
Although the fifth part of GTA was released to the world a long time ago it still does not look outdated This game is still fun and enjoyable to play And if you dont play then just arrange a pogrom on the streets or in the open spaces of a large open world
Even now the elaboration of the surrounding world is impressive Even the seabed is detailed
The game has an interesting storyline of three characters that is just fun to play Its also fun to explore the world
If you are a fan of this series of games you definitely need to play this game Its better than reading too many words

I definitely recommend this game to everyone"

Rockstar is still waging a technically illegal war against mods Look up Lewis Galoob Toys Inc v Nintendo of America Inc And to be blunt the game has become stale without mods GTA Online is also stale being filled with repetitive boring content We need Rockstar and Take 2 to back off the modding community and release a new game that isnt broken
its just like real life but instead you can live that life you always wanted

"TLDR Games trash Online carries trashier business model  Its not even worth 10yo chewed bubblegum Id steer clear from R at all times RDR2 is another disappointment better than GTA V but still bad

Games a carrot to hook you into Online  all of the sandboxing elements that made freeroam in single player any good were stripped or at bare minimum downgraded into virtual uselessness
Theres no sandboxing to be found other than some scarce robberies that give close to nothing in terms of rewards and do not raise any interesting gameplay aspects

Storys all over the place doesnt feel entertaining unless the player isnt cultured enough otherwise its a filler of cliches that have been told and seen countless times from a wide range of entertainment media films games books comics This GTA fails to bring anything substantial and new the handful of new things they did bring are walled or give as little engaging interaction as possible

Truth to be told RDR2 surpasses this game in every single aspect and RDR2 isnt an example of a good entertainment product itself given its tailored to milk money from players through online with the story mode also railing and removing a massive spectrum of sandboxing Both games are handled as corpo greed cashcows and nothing else

GTA 5 also lacks any sort of significant updates to fix broken parts of the game never got any updates to get it closer to completion a lot of obviously cut content can still be seen and its worse on both gameplay and UX when compared to San Andreas They didnt even bother allowing most things added through updates into Online to be acquired  available in Single Player

Id advise to boycott Rockstar until they spill out a faithful identical in game design and gameplay remake of San Andreas until than they should not see a single penny going their way  unfortunately ppl love to throw money at greedy borderline scams but itd be the only smart choice  Reasons that to be trusted again they should bring back something that is trustworthy we cannot take their word for new games instead we should demand something we know is good so they can earn said trust back Regardless the games not worth more than 10 bucks in its entirety its the most awful GTA ever made and I have a feeling that 6 will be much much worse

PS Its also important to note that the Online feature netcode is utter garbage its hard to even join any sessions game gets stuck there are consistent unable to join session issues etc It works fine for solo play but always glitches out whenever going for any sort of multiplayer content that involves other players Its also extremely fragile and prone to bugs loss of progress and almost all of the activities force multiplayer meaning that to play solo is extremely painful yet the only way to avoid issues with both glitches from Rs end and cheaters"

"Ah Grand Theft Auto V the virtual embodiment of mayhem mischief and morally questionable life choices With a collective playtime of 344 hours across all platforms its safe to say that Ive spent more time indulging in virtual crime than I care to admit And what a wild exhilarating and occasionally infuriating ride it has been

Lets start with the story shall we GTA V offers a narrative thats equal parts dark and humorous filled with colorful characters and twisted plot twists From the heists that require careful planning to the random encounters that leave you questioning your own sanity the story keeps you engaged even if it occasionally veers into absurdity

The openworld of Los Santos is a sprawling playground for those with a penchant for chaos Whether youre cruising the streets in stolen sports cars wreaking havoc with reckless abandon or engaging in epic shootouts with the authorities the sheer freedom of choice is undeniably enticing Just be prepared for the occasional frustration when the police force seems to have an uncanny ability to teleport right on top of you

The visuals in GTA V are undeniably impressive The sunsets casting vibrant hues over the cityscape the detailed textures of the bustling streets and the attention to detail in the character models all contribute to creating an immersive and visually stunning experience Its almost a shame that youre too busy causing chaos to truly appreciate the beauty of it all

The gameplay mechanics are a mixed bag On one hand the shooting mechanics are solid offering a satisfying blend of precision and chaos On the other hand the driving physics can feel like youre piloting a soapbox derby car on a buttercoated racetrack And lets not forget the joy of being randomly flattened by an AIcontrolled vehicle that seems to have no regard for your existence

GTA Online the games multiplayer component is a chaotic and unpredictable world of its own Its a realm where everyone fancies themselves as criminal masterminds engaging in highstakes heists and battling it out for supremacy in the streets Just be prepared for a healthy dose of griefing overzealous hackers and the occasional twelveyearold shouting profanities through their headset

But amidst the chaos and occasional frustrations theres a certain undeniable charm to GTA V Its a game that invites you to unleash your inner anarchist providing a guilty pleasure in the virtual realm Whether youre pushing the boundaries of morality or just blowing off steam after a long day GTA V offers an escape into a world where consequences matter little and mayhem is the order of the day

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a snarky and audacious playground for those who revel in digital anarchy With its engaging story visually stunning world and an abundance of opportunities for mischief its no wonder Ive spent 344 hours indulging in this virtual life of crime Just remember to approach it with a healthy dose of irony and a willingness to embrace the chaos After all life is too short to always play by the rules"

The online game is a complete waste of time Full of moronic hackers and cheaters as well as constant chat spammers Im Scottish and so are Rockstar Games For a company thats made so much money its a total mess online and really there is no excuse in the year 2023 for this bullsht Pull your breeks up Rockstar or get out of the gaming genre
"GTA V is an amazing game Seriously its absolutely incredible The amount of things you can do in this game is mindblowing From the moment you start playing youll be hooked trust me The game was released back in 2013 but it continues to shine as one of the best games out there offering an experience that is simply unmatched

Lets start with the story mode which offers an engaging narrative that keeps you hooked from start to finish Without giving away any spoilers I can assure you that the story is wellcrafted filled with twists and turns that will leave you wanting more The length of the story mode ensures that youll be entertained for many hours providing a rich and immersive experience Moreover the diverse cast of main characters adds depth to the narrative making it all the more enjoyable to play through Whether youre in the mood for chaos or simply want to partake in some cool activities GTA Vs Director mode allows you the freedom to explore and experiment without constantly worrying about the police

Moving on to GTA V Online the multiplayer component of the game the amount of content and things to do is mindboggling Rockstar Games has consistently provided updates and expansions that keep the online world fresh and exciting You mentioned a few of the activities such as bunker businesses nightclub management and selling special cargo and vehicles but that only scratches the surface of whats available The addition of heists in particular adds a cooperative element to the gameplay allowing you to team up with friends or other players to pull off elaborate missions The sheer variety of activities and the continuous support from the developers ensure that GTA V Online never feels stale or repetitive

However its worth noting that the games age does come with a few drawbacks While the visuals were impressive in 2013 newer games have since surpassed them in terms of graphical fidelity Additionally some players have expressed concerns about the online component specifically regarding balancing issues and the presence of microtransactions Nevertheless Rockstar Games continues to support the game and address player feedback striving to maintain an enjoyable and fair experience for all


WARNING
Be aware of cheaters in GTA V Online Some players may resort to cheating using hacks or mods to gain unfair advantages or disrupt the gameplay experience Cheaters can exhibit behaviors such as invincibility unlimited resources griefing and money exploits To minimize encounters with cheaters it is recommended to play in private sessions with trusted friends or inviteonly players Rockstar Games actively combats cheaters and encourages reporting of suspected cheaters Despite the presence of cheaters dont let it discourage you from enjoying the vast and exciting world of GTA V Online with precautions in place


FINAL SUMMARY  

If youre looking for an incredible gaming experience I highly recommend giving GTA V a try This game offers an outstanding adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end With its expansive open world and countless activities theres never a dull moment The story mode alone is worth diving into with its thrilling narrative and welldeveloped characters that will have you invested from start to finish And dont worry the story is long ensuring youll have plenty of gameplay to enjoy

But the excitement doesnt stop there GTA V Online is a whole new world of possibilities You can run businesses participate in exhilarating heists and explore a constantly evolving online world The amount of content available is mindblowing and theres always something new to discover Trust me you wont run out of things to do

Prepare to be blown away by the stunning graphics The attention to detail in the world of Los Santos is absolutely breathtaking making the experience feel incredibly immersive And lets not forget the fantastic soundtrack that sets the perfect tone for every moment

Oh and theres even more With the Director Mode you can unleash your creativity and become a virtual filmmaker creating your own custom scenes and movies within the game Its an incredible feature that adds an extra layer of fun and excitement

In conclusion if youre seeking an amazing gaming experience that offers endless possibilities and entertainment GTA V is the game for you Its a thrilling adventure that will keep you engaged for countless hours So go ahead jump into the action and prepare for an unforgettable journey in the world of GTA V"

GTA Online can be fun with friends but this fun is completely overshadowed by the games countless issues This game is filled with 5 minute loading screens that constantly fail to load or give you error messages This game is also riddled with hackers who will either kill you repeatedly spam your screen with ads for their service crash your game or in some cases even leak your personal information live in the text chat Yet after 10 years Rockstar refuses to do anything about these issues and leaves their players to deal with the games onslaught of problems

After over 500 hours and years of playing on this account have more hours on other platforms I ran into a gamebreaking issue I have this in my Steam and Epic Games libraries but the game seems to believe that Im playing a pirated version because every time I launch GTA V I get a request to activate my copy of the game However when I use my key from my steam copy I get an error saying that I already own the game No shit Rockstar This error wont even allow me to play story mode so the game is completely bricked Its mindboggling how this has been going on for years and theres no fix I didnt get banned never got an email from Rockstar never had an issue I played yesterday Im not buying another copy of this game
Too many cheaters but cool

"I am a 59year old father probably one of the oldest people playing Grand Theft Auto V
I am a single father to my son who is now 5 My son recently started playing Grand Theft Auto V
In less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours
This was terrible for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son because he was always out with his friends or watching YouTube So I decided to make a Steam account to play with my son
I started playing but this was my first time playing a video game since the 90s so I was quite lost I asked my son for help and together we spent some hours playing Grand Theft Auto V I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died
Playing video games reminded me that theres fun to be had in everything and it has brought
me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well"

Highly recommend Its a good all around game that allows its users to create their own personal experience in a world of corruption and greed I play purely for building and running the multiple businesses that the game has to offer while collecting vehicles and properties It can also be played as an all out war on everyone but it is overall a very versatile game for its age and has held up very well over the years

UPDATED REVIEW
After spending even more hours I could say that it is a very good game There are multiple types of businesses and honestly you should just focus on having fun with these businesses People nowadays are very stuck up with minmaxing everything to the point where they want to get the most amount of cash possible in the smallest amount of time and as someone who has been through that point I could say that it makes the game quite boring at a certain point Focus less on being efficient try and find a business that you find fun and do whatever you want and enjoy the game

Some downsides that are apparent in this game are the number of cheaters that are able to freely roam around servers There is also this glitch that I have been through ever since my first few hours of the game wherein when I open my ingame phone and go to quick jobs then join a heist alone I am always stuck in this infinite loading screen loop I have already searched it up on Reddit some say that it is a problem with my internet but some say its a problem with Rockstar servers 

Playing with friends is also very easy and the overall user interface of the game is easy to deal with Its also not a pay to win game but its a pay to get a head start type of game I have played GTA 5 online across several of my accounts before and it is also disappointing how Rockstar decided to remove hundreds of cars from the game I find it very unnecessary

Now is a very good time to play GTA 5 because of how there are even more concurrent players than ever before meaning that servers are very lively and you wont really feel brain dead in doing Rockstars repetitive missions"

"In the earlier phase of playing the game I enjoyed the game including Story Mode and Online even right now I would say that story mode is great but the story is too short and the map and story feels too small compared to the story and side missions experienced in SanAndreas One could just complete the whole story in less than 4 days Now coming to the online mode the big reason I would not recommend people to go for it because of my recent experiences of the online mode and I would also recommend people with limited budget to rather wait for GTA VI instead of buying this because as soon as GTA VI is released all the focus of Rock Star will move towards Vi which would lead to no to meager updates in GTA V Concluding that getting to my present Online experience right now the game is in more bad condition than it was an year ago as I am experiencing more in game bugs increase in hackers and multiple online sessions resulting failure I would say that if I am playing 1 Hrs in a day in online mode then Im actually only able to play only 40 Minutes maximum because minimum 20 minutes are being taken by bugs hackers session initialisation mission start and exit initialisation session faults which in the end leads to more frustration rather than entertainment
My personal mission experience  I was stuck at the end point of Online mission when I was delivering the cargo to a location when my vehicle stopped moving once I reached the delivery marker when I was required to move the vehicle inside a garage but was unable to because of being stuck at the marker with vehicle not moving my character unable to get out of vehicle then I killed myself and re did the mission and again same bug recently when I purchased an apartment I was trying to the apartment i purchased in online mode the game got all blacked out and stopped sunning I had to stop the game and start again on a mission I was to hide my presence from others I hid in a place as I was being hunted by other players due to one mission in online when I was hiding in an underground parking I was suddenly teleported to another location and killed by some player who was already there aiming at me in waiting as if he knew I would appear there then I thought it might have been a bug but when I hid again that thing continued to happen for at least 10 times till the timer was over and the hacker and bug did my game so bad that even after the end of the mission I was unable to exit the mission I was stuck at the mission timer reaching 0000 me being unable to exit until I switched to story mode and enter another session This is one list of harassment going on in game these days so i wont recommend anyone buying this and rather wait for GTA VI another reason being too less online players so less that it is getting to hard to get even 4 players to sometimes host a mission I would say GTA V is nearing its end"

Pew pew fun
"I will say this is a classic game almost too classic considering it came out in 2015 and we still dont have a sequel yet but I have to not recommend it for two main reasons

1 There is a severe lag issue when it comes to driving too fast This is surprisingly one of the few games I have had to tinker with significantly to make it play well enough and that came with the issue of having to lower the graphics a lot I dont believe it was my computer as this is a major issue that you can look up and see multiple people having on different hardware

2 The online is filled with hackers and cheaters Rockstar is unreliable when it comes to protecting their consumers so I would have to say if you dont know how to protect yourself well then you shouldnt risk it because no one will be looking out for you

If you only plan on playing the story and dont mind tinkering with your system to make it run well then it is a good game But if you plan on playing online or dont have the patience for fixing the game then pass on this"
Great game I have been playing this game during 10 years and I finally bought it on steam

easy to play and have fun when having looked at a tutorial on youtube
"Removing tons of content for Experience improvement but they will bring it back as time exclusives to trigger fomo an grabbing more cash from you Yes they removed content and telling you that this is good for you

Gta  Just pay Rockstar even more money for overpriced shit You want the removed cars again Just pay again and now there is no problem with the experience anymore lol

Rockstar trying to get rid of singleplayer modding because how dare you dont buy there shitty overpriced stuff and use free and better community mods 

Pandering to woke mob and trying to be woke Removing content because SJW are offended Oh boy I cant wait to play as pregnant black non binary xerxis saving the world against racist white males in GTA 6 if it ever will be released


Also steam is helping them with cleansing reviews like this which mentioning the truth Just like google is trying to reduce articels talking about their 200 cars remove patch"
shooting my friends is fun

Hackers just make the game unplayable The only way to play ONLINE mode without hackers crashing your game you have to play exclusively on invite only Might as well just stay on the story mode

Amazing Story line and Multiplayer game
"I like this game and all but there was an update that I wish never came or they should have done some stuff differently instead of removing more stuff then what they added in the Mercenaries Update to be added to that this is known as the worlds worst update Rockstar has ever released to the public 

So I dont recommend Until they change the fact that they removed 150 vehicles from the GTA 5 online vehicle websites And some of those vehicles that they removed are the ones that I was interested into buying And now I cant because of you ROCKSTAR

So ya I dont recommend to those new comers to this game until they change or add back some of the cars like the vehicles they added when they introduced the Auto shop to the game LIKE WHY ROCKSTAR WHY

WorstUpdateEver

Ah one last thing I hope that Rockstar adds a speedometer on the central hub when in vehicles And when a player is in ThirdPerson"
"Just a great game
lol"
cool i like the black guy he steal stuff
This game has been out for 10 years and they still havent fixed the infinite black loading screen glitch when loading into a property or between missions This goes without talking about all of the other bs from this past update

Removed 200 cars and labelled it as cleaning up the game on a 10 year old game that was doing fine before Nowadays they just want people to buy shark cards to make money and price all of the things in game at ridiculous prices to make you feel like you need to buy shark cards to keep up The rockstar game launcher is also shit and annoying They could have just left it how it was before Awful

I play mostly online and while the game itself is fun il have to leave a negative review as the serverssession system rockstar has going on is the worst system i have ever witnessed You are just as likely to spend as much time sitting waiting to join a lobby as you are playing the game thx for wasting my time"
better then gta 4
my screen get black every time i do heist
its good
Good memories and amazing game
when i mod in gta v offline mode it starts lagging so much that is downside of this
""
its extremely fun it does cost quite a lot but in my opinion I believe its worth the money Online is pretty fun aswell i enjoy the singleplayer mode Its not so bad and you can walk around without getting shot by an other player hope you enjoy enjoyed it as much as i do
فغغلا
Epic returning to Los Santos after so many years   the 3 person gamely is fun

Its GTA V so it is good duh

w game hacker  give me level 32
one of the finest multiplayer games to chill out with friends
"Do not buy it if you want to play the online mode
Solong story short I brought this game for around 15 eurosjust so I could play the online modethen after 30 hrs of installing it I finally ended up in an online lobbywhere I was killed multiple times then griefed by an modder and last but not least the game got crashed so baddly that my Pc crashed too
The fact that Rockstar charges money for this broken pile of garbage is like a bad joke in my opinion
 Oh and also you cant just buy the standalone gameyou are forced to buy some overpriced DLC with it for atleast 10 eurosyikes

The Offline mode meanwhile is fineit is a solid 30ish hrs of gameplaybut nothing more"
just its good

Iconic
Nice gameBut I request you to play it on pc not laptop It lags only on my laptop playable at 800x600  But really nice game Will continue to play it on Ps
best open world game and you can do job heist and much more more
"Rockstar stop updating the game and actually make it playable on PC without a million mod menus in use every day that can grab peoples IP and dox them grab all info about location and PC info which is shocking for a big game company like Rockstar
do better these modders need to get a life and stop being little cunts sat on this game
absolutely shit game other than private lobbies and friends lobbies
do not get gta other than for private lobbies or friends only lobbies Stay AWAY from public lobbies as much as possible"
Rockstar just let someone steal my game I try to sign in to social club and rockstar tells me sign in with an email address Ive never seen in my life Rockstar support refuses to message back
great game should deff play

One of the standout features of GTA 5 is its incredible storytelling The game boasts a rich and complex narrative following the lives of three protagonists Michael Franklin and Trevor Each character is unique and welldeveloped and their intertwining stories provide a level of depth rarely seen in openworld games The writing is sharp the dialogue is witty and the voice acting is topnotch creating an immersive experience that keeps you invested from start to finish

Grand Theft Auto V its fine now if you wanna play GTA V online you have to consider the huge amount of time you will waste on loading screens plus crashes of the game that will close it entirely and you will have to open it back which will cost you even more time also every single session you will join will have at least 23 cheatersmodders who will kill you on spawn without being able to react but log out of the game entirely

This game is amazing Playing in 2023 btw
the best game that i played
Played through this game several times on Xbox will play through it several more Theres a reason so many people play it One of the greatest games of all time in my opinion The world is so detailed and really makes you feel like a criminal in Los Angeles and California The story has been criticized by some but I feel most people will enjoy it unless youre a major bookfilm enthusiast who likes to deeply analyze stories and plots and is hard to please I dont enjoy the online experience but it has its moments every now and then Overall a 8 or 9 out of 10 for me
ITS A GOOD GAME

i love gta i play it lots on my xbox but i can never load into online idk why it just makes me wait ages can anyone help
for honestly i dont have any interest in GTA online nor in the story because the american crime story in GTA  become really old but the Mod what really interest me and what make me really want to play the game a lot

latest update removes 180 cars from the normal buypool and puts them in a rotating pool behind the gta paywall Absolutely disgusting anticonsumer practices from R although thats to be expected at this point
The bet game ever
the storymode is superb theres original quest funny character and full of action the online mode otherwise is just  long grindy game You start by doing poorly paid mission you unlock a heist you do it multiple time you buy more propertyasset and you repeat the process the cheaters are everywhere spamming the chat to sell you fake money for real money dont try to report them they know who report them If you wanna sell your stock in a public session pray god because 12 chance that someone is gonna ruin your fun with is flying moto with missile
ye
its fun i enjoy shooting people  Im not crazy i was tested when i was 7 and it came back negative
murder
too many bugs crashes often
cool i guess
L ima be back to cheat just wait
fuck this game i played i so much im fatter then nickocado avocado im 553 pounds
fdfdgbgngdngc
YUH
great game for gamers
idk what to write
very gut dake
Game is great started playing it on my xbox one then swithced to PC so now its even better then ever better fps roleplay servers just overall amazing cant wait for gta 6 to finally come out though
A must play game for any gamer The story of GTA 5 is fun intriguing and quite silly With many different mission and 3 different main characters the game play never gets old or boring Even after you finish the story you have the entirety of Los Santos to explore and have fun in This world is your oyster collect cars rob stores commit all sorts of crimes Get out there and cause some chaos
great game

Transphobic jokes are were we draw the line Removing offensive jokes adding a trans prostitute Yup that did it for me uninstalling this garbage Going to try to find a way to buy a physical copy of the 2013 version of the game

love the game

"I love this game so much that I want to delete the game after I buy the yatch

car get theft autod very cool mhm yes
Unplayable between the 5050 chance of a player being a cheater and it being a random chance to be able to join a friends lobby very frustrating to be chased and gunned down by god mode players that crash your game if you go passive or run away I dont recommend this game to anyone in its current state ten fold if youre trying to play with friends GTA is the only game that Ive played that I really really enjoy playing but I simply cant without something hindering the experience I cant wait for GTA 6 to more than likely follow the same fate at launch and it will because they never cared to fix it in GTA 5
where is the pc version of this game  it seems like the old 360 version the graphics for this are complete dog hit even in max settings hell my ps4 pro version looks better than this one its the same for the game control as well they are both hitty poorly detailed xbox versions instead of pc why is that  why cant we get the better pc versions on here  I swear fallout 76 is the only good detailed game on here that is for pc and the new steam client sucks 
amazing at first but still pretty fun
GTA 5 Online where you can embrace the chaos and let loose your wild side but unfortunately some players take it a step too far Picture this youre cruising down the virtual streets of Los Santos minding your own business when suddenly you hear ita player spewing slurs like a malfunctioning censor machine Its like they attended the School of Profanity and graduated with honors But fear not because GTA 5 has a secret weapon the mute button With one swift click you can silence those foulmouthed troublemakers and get back to enjoying the game Remember folks virtual mayhem is fun but spreading love and laughter is where the real partys at
somewhat gud game
it cool
it is very wholesome kid friendly for sure
very cool
very good
boobies
bring back the cars you removed and stop making shitty business decisions
it is a fun game and i have been playing it since the xbox 360 and with them modded lobbys used to be fire and fun

very good game
Dont buy this game for the online almost all the races have at least one guy that has speedhacks or other mods installed In my last game I got softlocked by one hacker with an exploit that I can find refrences to from 3 years ago Rockstar doesnt care about the state of the game all they care about is shoveling dlcs down our throat with more and more ways to get killed by someone without having any way of defending yourself Even disregarding the horrendous load times online the game has become a cesspool for shitty devs to reward long term players so they can curb stomp on anyone if they felt like it
Very good and fun game with a lot of action adn good missions The story is also very interesting

a very fun adn exciting game
too much hackers
i mean it was only 16 dollars so not that bad download take a lilltle bit but all well worth the time and money
"Considering how the remote code exploit has still not been addressed publically considering how the online game works on PC still running on peer to peer even though it is masked through proxies this game is still a cybersecurity hazard for anyone playing it This is on top of all the bad decisions on the part of Rockstar and Take Two squeezing every last penny out of the playerbase as if this game was a free to play But instead of it being free to play to this day it costs 80 of what i paid for it in 2016 40 euros Its not simply enough that someone purchases a game no no we have to milk them for every penny after I get it its just greed and opportunity But I dont have to agree with it or think it is moral

For anyone who sees this review and wishes to play singleplayer safely look into a firewall plugin and block every one of GTAOnline gateways Yes a modder can mess with your singleplayer game and potentially inject malicious code into it as well

What a mess"

"4510  They are only keeping up with this game to sell you sharkcards They just released an update that removed a lot of cars from being purchasable unless you pay for their SUBSCRIPTION 

The game sort of holds a monopoly on this type of game the online open world crime GTAesque so they can afford to be incredibly lazy unless its an endeavor to increase the chances that you buy those sharkcards This guise of being a sandbox game while having many more MMO elements to the game is quite disingenuous 

By the way they still havent fixed the hackers Every lobby on freeplay has AT LEAST 1 hacker many have half a dozen Whats almost worse is that the problems that hackers bring to this game were ALREADY present in the game  Griefing Greifing is so bad in this game that it can be downright unplayable is most public lobbies that they fairly recently HAD to make it so you could run your organizations and businesses in a private session to get away from them 

This game is an insidious waste of energy and money Youre only somewhat better off buying this on console"

Review

Grand Theft Auto V GTA V is an absolute masterpiece that has set the bar high for openworld gaming Developed by Rockstar Games this fifth installment in the iconic Grand Theft Auto series offers an unparalleled experience that seamlessly blends a gripping storyline immersive gameplay and a vast living world

One of the standout features of GTA V is its captivating narrative The game follows the lives of three protagonists Michael a retired bank robber seeking redemption Franklin a streetsmart hustler looking for a way out of the gang life and Trevor a volatile and unpredictable character with a penchant for chaos The intertwining stories of these characters create a rich and engaging plot that keeps players hooked from start to finish

The attention to detail in GTA V is truly remarkable The sprawling city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas are meticulously crafted offering a stunningly realistic and dynamic environment From the bustling streets filled with pedestrians and traffic to the diverse landscapes that range from urban areas to the picturesque countryside every corner of this world feels alive and vibrant

The gameplay mechanics in GTA V are polished and refined providing a seamless and enjoyable experience Whether youre engaging in highspeed car chases participating in adrenalinepumping heists or simply exploring the vast open world the controls are intuitive and responsive The game also offers a wide range of activities and side missions ensuring that theres always something new and exciting to discover

One of the most impressive aspects of GTA V is its online multiplayer mode Grand Theft Auto Online This mode allows players to explore the world of Los Santos with friends engage in cooperative missions or compete against each other in various game modes The constant updates and additions to the online mode have kept the community engaged and the experience fresh making it a significant value addition to an already outstanding game

Visually GTA V is a stunning achievement The graphics are breathtaking with detailed character models realistic lighting and impressive environmental effects The attention to detail extends to the sound design as well with a stellar soundtrack and voice acting that brings the characters to life

However its worth noting that GTA V does contain mature content and themes which may not be suitable for all players The games portrayal of violence crime and adult situations is integral to its narrative but its important to exercise discretion when considering its suitability for younger audiences

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is a true masterpiece that excels in every aspect Its gripping storyline immersive gameplay stunning visuals and expansive open world make it a mustplay for any fan of the genre Rockstar Games has once again raised the bar for openworld gaming and GTA V stands as a testament to their unparalleled craftsmanship"

"They just removed nearly Two Hundred 200 cars from being able to be normally bought in the game 
and of course put in place new systemssubscriptions to necessitate real money to access them 
systems and subscriptions that ARENT even accessible to those of us on PC

Rockstar has tarnished the experience of GTA on PC and last gen consoles to the point that you might as well not play it and even on newgen consoles they are clearly showing everyone the finger to anyone who isnt going to drop their wallet on their game"
I love this game from since it came out but the modders do me dirty
it made me reset all of my progress New Review Slightly better because of nice modders that give you money and xp wouldnt have to do this if i could transfer my account But the Jews over at Rockstar dont want that

The story mode is the real treasure of this game Little to no complaints with that I adored the characters the plot atmosphere all that etc etc My real gripe is the online mode It runs like total ASS Like Ive played mobile games that somehow not only run better but they also dont have their entire game being run by 12 year olds with 20 mod menus Its absolutely pathetic How much is this company worth again This game has not produced anything generally good since 2013 when it initially launched despite being updated constantly We dont care about your shitty mission DLCs that are all locked behind a paywall that would impress Trump himself Fix the game Put the cars back Get rid of all these stupid little Timmys running rampant with mommys credit card buying mod menus The LEAST you could do for this community is anticheat Jesus

Its good I didnt like this game at first and it was sort of not that fun But playing a couple of more hours in and its actually great Characters are good my favorite being Franklin And the missions are fun and are a great ways for going into another But I did have a problem with guns The recoil is not even there and the sounds are alright but it just felt weird to use a shotgun with barley any recoil or an lmg At least snipers have them but thats it Some missions would put you in a helicopter and its really hard piloting one of them Other than that its a great game
its okay I guess
good game wish they added some features from gta san andreas tho such as eating and working out but overall its a good game
fun
havent played it once
This game has taken my life from me
"This shit is broke ive installed it on two good working computers and the rockstar launcher crashes on both of them every single time Thought it might have been a corrupt file or something went wrong on install but I still havnt been able to see the loading screen for the actual game yet and it says i have 7 hours of play time ffs

Update A game bought off steam should simply install and run It says I have over 100 hours of play time but its because GTA5 wont close and it constantly says its running to steam Just installed again after months and the launcher freezes instantly and still unplayable Cant stop it from running in steam Think a refund would be nice since they obv cant fix their dog shit launcher problems"
Meh

I have been playing the Grand Theft Auto series since the original If I remember correctly that was released in October 1997 As for GTA VOnline I have bought multiple  copiesPS3 PS4 and PC A girlfriend and her kid enjoyed playing so much we had 3x PS3s and 3x TVs so we could all play together at the same time I have spent too much money on Shark Cards but got lots of cool vehicles with it This game is not perfect The developers are all about making money Will GTA VI ever come out Will it be any good That will happen if and when it happens In the meantime I definitely recommend GTA VOnline

"very cool lolo
buy game unless ur a child or smth P"
everything about thuis game is amazing
Single Player is good but Im leaving a negative review for ruining online and delisting the classics and replacing it with inferior versions GTA 6 will probably be trash as well but I wont bother trying it anyway
A timeless game even around 2023

"How greedy does R have to be to remove half the cars from being purchasable and put some of them behind a paywall with GTA
The missions from the new update are absolutely horrendous and it feels super dry when half the cars are gone

Its also absolutely ridiculous how the new xbox and the ps5 has access to GTA and all the cars they removed but pc doesnt Absolutely ridiculous

I dont doubt theyll even further disappoint its playerbase with another god awful update"

"Imagine if you will A game about cars

The game has hundreds of cars with new cars every update

Some base game carsearly DLC cars get left in the dust and ultimately they clutter up ingame websites

Now what would you do if you had to clean up the ingame websites

Would you

A Create a new website for the base gameearly DLC cars

B Add all of the early cars to the spawn pool so they can spawn in the world and remove them from the websites Allowing players to pluck them off the streets if they want them

C Remove almost 200 base gameearly DLC vehicles from the websites and basically make some cares IMPOSSIBLE to get on PC

Guess what options Rockstar went with It was C

This is a blatant cashgrab move from Rockstar to add these cars behind a paywall later on 

This along with YEARS of not updating the ingame economy makes GTA Online as grindy as modern MMORPG games 

Plus if this is how GTA Online turns out that means GTA Online 2 or whatever it will be with GTA 6 will be just as bad

I cant see myself playing GTA 6 not even the story mode I dont want to support scummy business practices"
good game
its literal the same game it aint got no worst but it aint got no better either
"Waaayy too many hackers in this game
Good game but can be hard to have fun when hackers are literally quitting your game like completely will turn off your game and you will have to load the game again from the launcher Hackers have many commands at their disposal to even control your game and what happens to all players not to mention they have the power to do almost anything they want with no consequences Rockstar do not care nor will they do anything about it However it is a fun game and is very enjoyable at times I do recommend it but get it on sale with the biggest shark card youll need as much money as possible as everything is way overpriced

Also I will add the servers for online are terrible 
Always disconnecting and the load times are pathetic"

I got the game for 15 dollars and I havent regretted it The graphics are breathtaking and can be enjoyed in 240 fps There were no stutters for me The open world is fantastic and online with friends its fun Doing missions with strangers is rather less fun the Story is a must I can only recommend it Overall I recommend the game"

Its fun but alot of bugs
the new Online update removed ober 180 vehicles from being purchased which is an awful decision Most of these will never be available again to PC players while console need to pay for GTA to purchase them now Ridiculous concept awful decisions
Its blatantly obvious that Rockstar isnt listening to their fanbase nor do they like them Theyve taken away vehicles and locked them behind a subscription theyve added new content locked behind millions of dollars only to earn about 200k in reward to doing these poorly made stories and theyve failed to give anything to progress the game aside from a few cameos of the main characters This game needs to be revised by its dev team and redone to make everything actually acceptable to play for both veterans and new players alike Theres a reason why money and rp hacking is such a huge problem in this game and they need to update their progression and finance system to actually gain more traction than what theyve gained the past few years

"Grand Theft Auto V GTA V is a game that exists in a league of its own Having logged in an impressive 369 hours on the game I can confidently say that Rockstar Games has once again outdone themselves in creating a world that is not just vast and beautiful but also vibrant chaotic and full of life Its a testament to the meticulous attention to detail and the phenomenal execution of design concepts that permeates every aspect of this game I unequivocally recommend this game to anyone seeking an immersive thrilling and grandeurfilled gaming experience

From the outset the narrative of Grand Theft Auto V is compelling weaving together the storylines of three distinct protagonists Michael Trevor and Franklin Each character is uniquely flawed and equipped with a depth and complexity that keeps you invested in their journeys The narrative jumps between these characters serving up a rich tapestry of criminal undertakings thats both humorous and harrowing reflecting the diverse realities of the fictional city of Los Santos and the surrounding Blaine County

The mission design in GTA V deserves a heap of praise Each task is meticulously detailed and varied never letting the player settle into complacency From highstakes heists to casual errands that inevitably spiral out of control every mission contributes to the broader narrative and character development in a meaningful way The heist missions in particular are an innovative element that allow you to take part in planning preparing and executing elaborate criminal ventures

The openworld aspect of the game is arguably one of the most detailed and immersive ever created Los Santos and its surrounding areas are strikingly vast and offer a multitude of activities You can indulge in street races go hunting in the wilderness play golf trade in the stock market or just explore the bustling city and its outskirts Every corner of the game is meticulously crafted with a level of realism thats breathtaking The games dynamic weather system and daynight cycle add to the immersive experience making the game world feel alive and constantly changing

GTA Vs gameplay mechanics are superb providing a satisfying mix of driving and combat The driving mechanics feel responsive and varied across the wide range of vehicles available each with their unique handling characteristics The combat system too is robust with a cover system that is intuitive and a wide range of weapons each with distinctive pros and cons Moreover the introduction of the special abilities for each protagonist adds an extra layer of depth to the gameplay mechanics

Online multiplayer introduced via Grand Theft Auto Online provides a wholly different experience that further expands the games shelflife Here you can team up or compete with players around the globe in a variety of missions races and deathmatches or simply roam the world freely causing mayhem The continuous content updates from Rockstar keep this mode fresh and engaging ensuring theres always something new to explore or achieve

Graphically the game remains impressive even years after its initial release with stunning visual effects and detailed character models The ingame sound too is excellent with a highquality voice acting that breathes life into the characters and an extensive genrespanning soundtrack that complements the games atmosphere brilliantly

The game isnt without its flaws though The police AI can sometimes feel frustratingly relentless and the load times especially for GTA Online can be lengthy However these issues are minor when compared to the wealth of content and meticulously crafted gaming experience that GTA V offers

In conclusion Grand Theft Auto V is an absolute masterpiece of interactive storytelling combining a compelling narrative stunning graphics a wide array of gameplay mechanics and a detailed dynamic world that feels genuine and vast Moreover the games willingness to tackle themes of crime morality and the American Dream through its narrative and characters shows a depth of storytelling that goes beyond what one might expect from an openworld actionadventure game

Rockstars trademark satirical social commentary is peppered throughout the game adding a layer of intelligence and wit to the narrative From the ingame TV shows and websites to the various NPCs you encounter GTA Vs keen critique of contemporary society makes the game feel grounded and real despite its more outrageous elements

Another noteworthy aspect of Grand Theft Auto V is its wide array of side activities The game is filled with additional missions hobbies and pastimes that are optional but add further depth and immersion to the game These can range from investing in real estate or the stock market to participating in triathlons stunt jumps or even hunting for collectibles These side activities not only help flesh out the world but also serve as a diversion from the main storyline offering opportunities to delve deeper into the games mechanics and universe

Furthermore Rockstars dedication to updating and refining Grand Theft Auto Online has also added significant value to the game long after its initial release New heists missions and vehicles keep the multiplayer mode fresh and exciting encouraging players to keep returning to the world of Los Santos and Blaine County Plus the addition of usercreated content in the form of jobs and races contributes to an everexpanding universe for players to explore and enjoy

However no game is perfect and Grand Theft Auto V is no exception While the AI has significantly improved from previous iterations it can still behave erratically at times occasionally pulling you out of the immersion In addition some players might find the games depiction of violence and use of explicit language offensive although these elements are indeed consistent with the games mature and gritty narrative

In summary Grand Theft Auto V is an unparalleled achievement in the realm of video games Its compelling narrative coupled with a vast vibrant world intuitive gameplay and an everevolving online component make it a game that stands the test of time Despite minor shortcomings GTA V offers a gaming experience that is both thrilling and deeply engaging making it a mustplay for any serious gamer Its a captivating journey into the dark underbelly of the American dream offering a compelling exploration of its characters complex personalities and motivations I cannot recommend it enough"
Its a fun and relaxing game lets go

Its GTA V man I dont know what else to say
red colors
Bought it 1 year after it released on PC right when the Online component first released So yeah lots of years ago I could not recover that account for the life of me it was 15 bucks on hear so fine ill buy it again Fun stuff Worth the 15 bucks hate the monetization Single player is the breadwinner hear Online is the cherry on top Just dont spend money on  it Dont need to

Online kinda sucks now but story mode is still fun
shoot people
This is so cool i got a lap dance from cheetah

good game
Game fun I only play online mode though 
online sucks
it is a cool game 
This game lags too much i cant even enjoy it without its lagging on story mode There needs to be a option where you do not want to  do story mode and just play with others but its a must to do the modes
This game here is one of the best out there I just love to do missions and intract with others and drive with them for no reason in online But the thing is hackers are making your life hard After my work i used to take off my steam in this game But these hackers are making the game unplayable Killing you for no reasons Blocking your game for no reason Making you get attacked by trevor  and military for no reason crashing the game trapping you in a cage so overall all the sessions are taken over by the hackers only If an hacker is present in the session your game will get stuck when you enter a building or after you finish a mission it keeps loading so i play around 2 hours max and 15 hours i have to wait for the game to load or go to a session with less hackers a hacker who minds his own business Worst part is Rockstar only need money they are not at all doing anything to prevent them I decided to move on from GTA 5 forever
You forget 1000 things every day make sure this is one of them
its a good game for children it is very educational in worth ethics 
"THE most poorly designed multiplayer experience Ive ever had the displeasure of paying for ever

very fun
ITS FUN

pretty fun missions are good guns and explosives are nice to use but why does the shoe store have naked women in it
amazing
A publisher that REMOVES nearly two hundred vehicles to streamline the shopping experience ten years after release to put them behind a paywall that PC users cant access is the epitome of thumbing their nose at their users I came back to the game after a long hiatus and find found collecting the cars to customize to be the most enjoyable thing about returning Maybe I like driving the cars that no one else does Maybe Ill never buy them Maybe I would have bought them all Either way if they were available to us once then they should continue to be so Would you accept a car company entering your garage to remove the turbocharger that you bought with your car Or worse that company telling you that if you want to have the turbocharger that youll now have to pay a premium Its slimy
This game good 
booty hole
Too many hackers cant find a lobby without a modder hacking
very fun to play especially with friends

girl melon cool
GUUD
In the flour attic crackling cookie jars danced in the laundry napkin while crocodile soup jazzily hops on the cloud carpet Space pirates cleaved dark sourdoughs while stardust laughed in symphonic discord The snake god clipped featherlight with the screwdriver while the grapevines fenced in sniffling elephant herds Dewdrops discussed quantum physics with intertwined kittens and discovered that the harmony of time lay in a lost sock at a cosmic party Summer rain waltzed with the indecisive thoughts of the hourglass while the rusty trumpet sang love songs to anxious rainbow flies The windmill spun dreamily among the lost breaths of a blue whale and the misplaced key to the essence of everything was found under a talking mushroom
i just like the game
Very Fun and Enjoyable game But Public lobbies are chaos most people playing invite only sessions only these days The only problem of this game are glitches
ITS VERY fun to play with friends u have to buy it kaka

"The game Just went PayToPlay 
After 1000 years Rockstar just updated the game 2023 and REMOVED ALOT of content fore a new Premium Gta Program
FUCK OFF Ppl loosing there earned Stuff because a Paywall suddenly demands all your stuff Fucking Disgusting The last good developer just joined EA and UbsiSoft WEAK ROCKSTAR"

so good
yahhhhh
Im sorry but I cant turn on gta 5 Ive tried everything to fix it
R wont take action against modders    PvP is impossible because everyone uses godmode or mod menu  PC doesnt get content updates that new gen consoles get  Bugs and Glitches force you to find a new lobby every half hour or so    Ive uploaded videos of modders being abusive and have reported them only to see them again in a week doing the same thing    Boycott Rockstar    GTA6 is around the corner and Rockstar only cares about the money    They dont give a Four letter word about their game    If they did they would implement a working anti cheat they would fix the bugs that have been around for 5 years and they would show their PC players some love by giving them the same content that consoles get  DO NOT BUY    BOYCOTT ROCKSTAR  
i heve it on ps4 since 2016

This game destroys lives and breaks families Like Robby just be beating his meat to strippers all day He calls real women ugly and mid but those pixel whores do it for this sick son of a bitch It has consumed him he does not even talk to the kids anymore He just sits their in his own filth wasting away to get fake money The house smells like pizza and shit His eyes are blood shot his skin pale as the moon and he can not even talk like a normal person All he can say is GTA W or Rizzler Please help he does not have many more days it might be too late
this is such a fun you need to try it out the story is great and in online you can make your own character i would recommend you play gta 5
